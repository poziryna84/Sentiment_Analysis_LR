I did not stay at the hotel but I was horribly treated in their restaurant.
20 mins seated before I got a menu and I was the first guest for lunch.
"The food was excellent but tthe service was terrible, the maitre had an attitude and the staff was very cold and did not pay me any attention."
"Although the food was great the staff was awful, I would never recommend this hotel."
Fantastic pastry shop on La Via Rambla in Barcelona.
Girl at counter was exceedingly helpful; offered a $5 Euro tip for her help packaging a box of chocolates which was vehemently refused.
Felt sort of bad because there was a line 8 deep and she spent about 10 minutes on getting the gift-wrapping perfect.
Food looks extremely tasty.
Perhaps may be categorized as the equivalent of Fauchon in Paris although Mallorca has a more extensive selection of gourment food.
You can not go wrong with a gift of chocolate from Escriba.
"I did not stay here, but did eat at their restaurant."
The service was very poor.
"Our waitress was rude, unattentive and unapologetic when the kitchen delivered the wrong meal - and then charged us for her mistake."
"I found the whole experience totally unsatisfactory, which is a shame because the space is great and the food was good."
"at the ""famous"" restaurant the tasting menue dishes were extremely small, really a laugh - thats nouvelle cusine at its worse!"
moreover the fish was halfraw and really noting special --- 60 € per person!
better to eat outside!
"at the bar round the lobby next day they let us wait for 40 minutes - they just forgot our order (toast, sandwich)!"
but they gave us the drinks for free ... the pool on the rooftop is not a pool its a laugh - and they do not serve drinks to the rooftop in may!
it`s just too expensive for what they offer!
Called in here for an evening meal.
"We were asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't have."
We were told the restaurant was fully booked for the evening.
But there were piles of tables to one side.
If this had been France a table would have been found for us.
Not impressed.
still top notch
"if the losing bull is on your must have list, this restaurant serves the freshest."
other dishes range from outstanding to outlandish.
"a culinary delight, creative yet not frou frou."
the father & daughter team know what they're doing with some fantastic & fresh ingredients!
"decor is sort of minimalist, and lacks noise reducing furniture."
"when we went, there was not too many people, so it was ok. but i guess,it can be a bit noisy, altought tables are quite appart of one another."
i hope they do not reduce the space.
food was p
If you are a chocolate lover then visit.
Well worth purchasing chocolate there plus a small (very small!)
restaurant area for lunch and an opportunity to sample the fare.
Near to Passeig Gracia just off the Ramblas de Catalunya (north of Plaza de Catalunya).
"for a relaxing dinner, try the seating that practically right on the beach."
well prepared seafood is good but not top of the line.
"A fantastic little cava/tapas bar just down the road from the Picasso Museum , El Xampanyet is a must for any visitor to Barcelona."
The short but bustling bar has a superb atmosphere and the staff are incredibly helpfull.
"Get there just about 8 o'clock (or earlier) if you want a table otherwise you may have to stand, the place gets really busy later on."
"The cava they serve is absolutely amazing, definately the best I've ever tried."
The tapas are basic but tasty and varied too.
It's not an expensive bar but it's not that cheap either.
The atmosphere alone makes it worthwhile though.
Please go here!!
!
"This is the best bar we came across in Arenal, Justin and Amy are really friendly people, Nothing was too much trouble."
"The Karaoke is one of the biggest We have seen, over 12,000 songs acording to justin and we well believe it, not only in English but spanish, french and german."
Although British run there was a good cross section of nationalities here all having a good time.
Keep up the good work
I was looking for a mexican place in madrid and found this lovely mexican restaurant called La Mordida its located in las fuentes 3 28013 madrid entre mayor y arenal.
they have other 2 locations.
but if you are just tired of spanish food come here!
its the best the place is very friendly nicely decorated mexican style.
"I would recommend here the nachos with guacamole, the ensalada de pollo if you like a bit of spicy and pollo flor!"
and dont leave without having a margarita!
"I loved this place for its food, for the friendliness of the waiters and for the margaritas!"
I loved this restaurant in Benidorm in my opinion the best there!
"its located Avenida Ruzafa, 2 03500 El Rincón de Loix - The Paella there its great!!!"
the best!
and every other food they serve there its absolutely wonderful and well cooked.
and for dessert they have this amazing helado de Turron.
you just have to try it!
its a bit pricey but its worth it!
I was recommended this place by a local for really good tapas - note it is one building in from the central square and tower (so not the restaurant right on the corner).
"They have a tapas bar and a restaurant but we went for tapas - great food, cheery service (some english spoken by some - not others - but you'll get by!)."
For about 60 euros for two - you eat and drink like a lord!
It is true to say that the hot chocolate I had in the cafe of this shop was exceptionally good -- the best I have had in fact.
Unfortunately this was the only item in my 4 item order that was delivered as requested.
One didn't turn up and the other two bore no resemblance to what was ordered.
When mentioned to the waitress I was told that I couldn't change my order as the drinks/pastries had been prepared.
"So for the sake of around 8 euros they have lost my custom in the shop, any chance of a return visit and got a lousy review on a website."
Shame.
Cafe Mambo & Cafe Del Mar are fantastic bars!
"Literally hundreds of people head down there every night to watch the famous Ibiza sunset, and it truly is beautiful!"
"As the sunsets people scream, clap & cheer & the music goes up!"
You cannot go to Ibiza without experiencing this - the most amazing way to start of a perfect night in Ibiza!!!
x
This place is wonderful.
"The decor is sophisticated and stylish, the guys who run the place are attentive, polite and helpful, and the food and drinks are delicious - try their mojitos, best I've had anywhere; the Salad El Gato and the Spinach salad starters and knockout (strawberries and brie, and peaches with mint), while the hake in herb sauce, and the slightly spicy chorizo meatballs really hit the spot."
The food is good value and of a very high quality - all the ingedients are fresh.
"We went back several times and have recommended the place to everyone - if you're ever in Torremolinos, give it a go."
Okay so the sunsets in Ibiza are beatiful and there is a great atmosphere on the boardwalk/cafe del mar area before the sunset but safe yourself a lot of money(beers start at 6 euros) and dont sit on the deck of cafe del mar but rather sit on the beach directly below the deck where tons of people are camped out to see the sunset...you can still hear the music and relax without the big tap afterwards.
"overall, i was very disapointed with the place and will go to the beach the next time."
We loved Cafe Mambo from the moment we arrived at 1pm.
"The plan was to enjoy everything about Club Mambo drinks, lunch, more drinks, dinner and a beautiful sunset."
"Here's useful info - jug of champagne sangria 22 euros, goats cheese salad 9 euros, glass of wine 5 euros - sure if you want a front table to watch the sunset then they want you to spend 100 euros in alcohol for the pleasure."
"Tip - get there around 5ish, get into the second row of tables from the front and as long as you're drinking and eating a bit then the table is yours until 9pm sunset."
Another tip - make friends with the Maitre'D and then when you need a dinner reservation at Villa Mercedes she's the gal to ask to ensure you get the best table in the house!
"We had an exceptional wedding anniversary suffused with gorgeous sunshine, beautiful people, delicious food and sexy grooves - what more would anyone want from a holiday?"
Save your money and go to Club Mambo and spend it!

"it´s a café, but it is ok"
Overall it's a very good restaurant for those who love sushi food.
"They take quite a while to bring you your orden sometimes, but it's worh it."
During the week they have executive menus (3 I think) for lunching hours which are afordable and bring a good amount of food.
"At night or on the weekends the price of the menu is medium (€25 or 30 per person), and many people go there, so is best to make a reservation or go early."
"Nice place, good food and affordable"
"Nice place, a little bit noisy."
I recommend to go early or reserve place before.
"""Tostas"", ""Tortilla"", ""Montaditos"", ""Cammember con arándanos"", ""Puntillas"", ""Ibérico"", ""Mouse de pato"",..."

Correct but not authentic in the way it should be...

"The food is a little spicy, mostly if you are not used to Indian food."
so drink water when you finish and a tea ;) or ask for little spicy dishes..

Also the small thali is good enough for sharing two people and has an interesting and intriguing desert.
"Remember, it's a veggie restaurant so don't expect any meat,.."
I'll be back there soon
"Merlin is, if not the best, certainly one of the best restaurants to grace this island and no visit to Gran Canaria is complete without a meal at this friendly establishment."
"There are plenty of places on the island for the budget diner, but Merlin is not one of them."
"The flirtateous yet very professional waiters, most of whom have worked here for years, take great pride in their craft and it shows."
"Merlin is open six days a week, closed on Mondays, and table reservations are recommended."
They have a varied menu but their seafood is world-renowned.
"nice, typical bar but quality has decreased significantly over the last years, extremely crowded"
1 Word - Rabbit!
2 Words - Fish Stew!
Good price and quality but not one of my picks for sure...

Nice place to have tapas!
My favorite pintxos bar in Donostia.
Very creative menu.
Good value for money.
They do not take reservations
The interior is better then the food.
Great little spot right in the middle of the old town.
The interior is themed right down to the 50's style bus chairs.
The food is excellent for what they do - large salads and incredible crepes (both sweet and savory).
"After dinner, you're also in the best spot to make a great night out in Girona."
A bit touristy place but “cocido madrileño” is very nice there.
Have a long walk around Palacio Real afterwards to help digest your meal!
Really good food but i hate their annoying attempts to always sell you more.
It feels more like beeing on a market.
That's not very comfortable.
:(
Veery Spanish-style bodega.
"Good tapas, I have had my most Almodovar moments in there."
Nice rustic location.
Very typical.
despite the stars this is not exactly my cup of tea.

Service is in the hands of model-looking but smart(!)
people.

Very nice buffet!!!
Best are the meats!

Typical Spanish Grill.

A crappy place for tourists who want to get ripped off by terrible food
Great thai restaurant!
"Awesome food, affordable, and nice atmosphere."
Definitely going back there!
You must book as there is only 8 tables!
"beau, bon, pas cher"
Not as good as the restaurants in the US.
Everything tastes watered down and the service is typically Spanish.
Good luck getting that free refill.
perfect croquetas and interesting new flavours for traditional tortillas.
"as in ""La Ancha"" you can have a beautiful, huge and paper thin Milanesa."
"Good for being a franchise, could have more imaginative menu"
I was once there with abou 5 swiis and 10 poles.
Two of us ended up being verbally abused by the staff.
Never again.
My favourite meal in Barcelona was here!
"Fresh dorado with caramelized eggplant, straight from the Sta Caterina market next door."
The bar also serves one of the better coffees we had in BCN.
"Cold and impersonal, despite the warm decor."
Waiters are stupid
"Right next to the Santa Caterina market, so absolutely fresh, good & varied food!"
"This is the greatest authentic restaurant, away from the tourist traps, in Barcelona!"
Good steak (chuletón) and red peppers
Great view of the Mediterranean and an excellent menu.

Not for snob people.
Typical Spanish food.
Typical spanish
"Lovely traditional cuisine, good location."
A bit expensive
beautiful fideua with foie gras.
"No the best sushi in town, but one of the few good ones that is open for lunch."

go there early!
good food and presentation.
"cheaper then the average and good looking site, but a little full of people... and they don't book!"
The seafood paella is great for the price and a generous portion for two.
"Oh, come on !"
Who's never had a drink or two in Plaça del Sol ?
Real home made cuisine.
Typical regional food.
Very posh.
"Good service and, in my opinion, overpriced food."

Upstairs for the more formal treatment.

"Incredible, delicate grilled food like nothing else."
Definitely worth a trip and the difficult time to find.
Cozy atmosphere
18th jan 2007.
With Barbara.
"Looks like a Spanish tavierna from outside, but surprise it is a sushi place - a fusion sushi place!"
"Service is fast and effective, the crowd is cool, cuisine incredibly creative."
"Try the new cotoletta and chimichurri maki, but don't forget the classics like tuna and salmon nigiri or semi-classics like eel and avogado."
"Cannot reserve, so it is mostly a hit-or-miss"
"Good food, but as most Japanese restaurants in Barcelona, limited menu and pricey."
"Good food , great prices."
Another classic from the 60s.
Omelettes of all kinds are the specialty of the house.
Has lost a lot of charm over the decades...
"It is definitely not a bad place: the food is good and as a place to eat tapas Cerveceria Catalana is ""ok""."
"However, from some reason in my opinion there is nothing too special in the restaurant."
"Altogether, good three points."
"Next to the shops, but very different from the turist traps you find everywhere."
"Service is good and fast, the place is cosy and food - yummy!"
The best dish (tapas) was the one that had fish and cheese in a pepper.

A bit posh and sometimes “rude” service by waiters.
"it's ok, but for the best sushi bar, go to ""Ginza"" (Marques de Cubas)"
The best restaurant in Spain!!
!
Thats a mediocre restaurant that some how got a reputation as a good one.
There is nothing special about it and moreover I had the feeling everything was covered with so much gravy you won't know what you are actually having...
"Very good seafood, not as expensive as other restaurants in the area, though it is not cheap."
Love it.
A great place for traditional tapas.
Try the Vermut.
Yum.
"Try the Pimientos do padron, mejillones rellenos, and the famous tortilla de Betanzos!"
As dessert the tarta de almandras.
Great!
Average I would say.
But good hospitality.
I'd like to thank them for the music they played for us!
(piano)
Art-deco.
Where those guys in the late 19thcaught up.

"get in, admire the Modernist Art, and leave without paying for an overcharged beer"
Classy winery.

Franchise food.
You know what you are going for...
There can be some problems when ordering if u don't recognize the fish etc....
Incredible eggs!!

a bluff.
extremely expensive for the quality of food/service.
Nothing compared with what it used to be.
Hideously turned into a charmless tourist trap.
Never thought about eating here.
Good price for drinks considering where it is.
Used mainly as a meeting point.
THE meeting point.
Expensive.
"never eaten here, however nice cafe con leche"
Seems an old stable or garage converted into a restaurant.
It kept the original walls and ceiling giving it that old warehouse feeling.
"Food served is mainly Catalan traditional with a nice selection of embutidos, aumados and cheeses."
It also has a good variety of wines.
Very casual restaurant with a warm atmosphere
A great stop-off for lunch on the way to Asturias.
The broad beans with serrano ham were excellent!
We also stopped to see some Gaudi architecture while we were in town.

Great cheap buffet/lunch menu.
Food is nice but too expensive for what you get.
Service a bit slow but nice atmosphere.
Average
very good rest.
But is not easy to book a table
The best for sea food.
You pick what you want fresh from the fish counter and they do it on that moment.
The only drawback is the long queue outside before you can get a table
Nice fondues!!!
A bit expensive.
You must book!
One of the BEST authentic tapas joints just off the touristy Santa Ana plaza.
Heavy on atmosphere!
A great place to watch football matches.
Great gambas a la plancha!

leave the decision of what ou're going to eat to Iñaki.
you won't be dissapointed.
French food very good!
I liked both the place and the food.
For less than 10 euros I could have a nice three course menu.
The restaurant is clean and the stuff is fast and efficient.
"One might need to wait to get a table, but waiting is definitely worth especially if one is curious to try tasty vegetrian food."

"Definitely a better option than all the touristic tapas places in the Rambla (just a few steps from this ""taberna"")."

"A good selection of ""platos combinados"" too."
"There's another Bideluze in Plaza de Guipuzcoa, same menu, with a decoration a little more pub..."
But I like this one best.
Famous Chinese restaurant in Madrid.

Good but expensive.
nothing outstanding...
One of the top Mexican reataurants in Madrid.
"The food and service are very good, prices are very reasonable for the size of the servings, and the location is great, right in the middle of the Chueca nightlife."
Against: it is a bit cramped.
"Being a vegetarian (and also very fussy with food as I don't eat eggs, fish or peppers!)"
I sometimes struggle when we go out to eat.
My boyfriend and I went a few times during our stay in Lanzarote and this restaurant catered extremely well for vegetarians enabling me to have a different dish on each occasion.
I would definitely recommend the aubergine - it was out of this world!
The restaurant was extremely clean and the waiting on staff very friendly and accommodating.
I could not fault this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Puerto del Carmen.
The only bad thing about it is it's not near my house in the UK!
Fantastic food.
The Clams are the best and so are the croquetas!
"as with lots of Spanish restaurants, small family owned, with great atmosphere."
The food here is from the region of Galicia in Northern Spain.
Delicious.
Organic beef.
Good burguers.
Creative mediteranean cooking.
They only use market products.
Modern settings.
Was my favourite for a while.
MUST book.
"A lot of famous people come here, as well as many tourists."
"Didn't like the place too much, but the view on the park and palace is nice."
Nice tapas!!!!!
and lovely sangria
I like it...
They have a great tuna tartar!
!
Please be careful here.
"From the beginning everything was absolutely great - the waitress nice, the soups tasty."
Then we ordered two meat dishes.
"One of them was ""pierna cadera"" (lamb leg)."
"It looked nice, but was frozen inside."
"So it had been cooked before, then frozen (a dangerous trick because of salmonellosis) and then warmed up again."
We sent the meal away and yet became it in the bill.
The explanation that we were not going to pay for obviously bad food didn't help.
"The owner began shouting, as I tried to explain something in English he cried ""You're in Spain and speak Spanish here""."
"Very unpleasant... As I asked for a book of comlaints the answer was ""Pay and after that you get the book""."
And at the end of all this terror he refused to sign the complaint (that is already a punishable act).
At the tourist office where we went for help the office said he knows this restaurant for deceiving himself.
"So never, never, never!"
"Lovely Italian food, gourgeous Italian waiters and cooks!"
"Good ""torradas"" tipical catalan for young people..."
Good... this is Barcellona food.
"Original food, but scarce!"
A great pick for summer: they have one of the best terasse in Bcn.
"Indoor seating isn't all that good though (a bit cantine like, very noisy...)."
"The food is correct, not too expensive (italian food mainly)."
"very decent, but nothing out of this world."
Too typical.
"There are much better restaurants in BCN, by far."
A classical restaurant for fish and paellas from BCN
nice sandwiches!
"if u come to mallorca (balears island) ,spain, and if u really want to eat japanese traditional food, this restaurant is the best."
they give u the option to chose a menu (eg: the sushit menu) or chose the dishs u want.
"the food is more den fresh, and while u eat ull know that the cook not only cooks but puts all his art and love into his work."
nice old place to have a cofee...
Were all tourist go in BCN...
ok... it'a a good restaurant in the Born
"Maybe one of the best for ""paellas"" in Barcelona, for a reasonable price."
Good meat Argentinian style
good japanese food
If you like chocolate...
not brilliant.
Not bad either but the food is nothing special.
Standard restaurant.
a different place
"there's always a queue, but service is quick, very friendly and the food is great and reasonably priced."
A very good Lebanese restaurant.
One of my favourite italian restaurants in BCN.
"Elegant, expensive... good food"
ok for some tapas
Good
"Fab, fab, fab!"
!
Excellent food  Great with children You decide your own portion size BEST T Bone I've ever tasted
Decoration is a must.
Popular prices.
Best omelettes in town!
!
"NICE PLACE , NICE FOOD..."
"cheap, but you can not book... so be ready to cue..."
"""You get what you pay for""."
Don't get impressed by the queues.
Food is ok for price but far too mainstream and without phantasy.
Service is not very friendly.
"They wanted to create something with a romantic atmosphere but it's just too obvious that it's a trap, partially a tourist trap."
Overall experience is that it's better to go somewhere else.
Very centric...ok
Nice place.
very central with nice view over Passeo de Gracia.
better to book.
They do mediteranean cooking.
"very good, and reasonably priced."
Good chinese in BCN
Amazing incredible fish!!
and lovely place.
"Exclusive restaurant, excellent sea food and fish, reasonably priced."
perfect for business dinners too.
Very nice burgers... that's about all I can say because it's what I always end up having when I come here!
good italian
One of the best places for tapas in Bcn.I LOVE IT.
OK FOR GROUPS.
Great for lunch on sunny afternoons any time of year.
A bit out of the way but worth the trek.
We were a group of seven spending Christmas week 2007 in the Andalucia region in Spain and wanted to have dinner in a place where Spaniards ate.
The front desk staff at our hotel in Mijas-Costa recommended this place to us and I’m very glad they did!
"This was our most delicious, fun meal during our entire time in Spain."
"Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted by Jaime Clemente, the charming young proprietor, who was behind the bar."
"He asked us if we preferred to eat in the rather large bar area or if we wanted to eat “inside.” Not really knowing what it meant, we picked “inside.” It turned out to be a spacious, yet cozy, dining area with many cloth covered tables and comfortable chairs."
"The décor was very Spanish – bullfighting pictures, trophies, and an enormous bull’s head on the wall."
Mr. Clemente pulled tables together to accommodate our group and we ended up sitting directly under the bull.
We ordered enough food for 20 people.
"After ordering our first bottle of wine, we began with an assortment of olives, pickles, and bread."
"Next, we had fried calamari."
Our third dish was the best – the house specialty called Moorish Chicken.
It was divine!
And we ended with a scrumptious seafood and chicken paella.
We were too full for dessert and instead had shots of an amazing rum caramel liquor.
We were the only guests in the restaurant and Mr. Clemente indulged us by changing the western music to Spanish guitar music.
Then towards the end of dinner he switched it again to salsa music to which we danced a bit between the tables.
It was a blast!
"Mr. Clemente packed up our left-overs for us and we bounded out into the night, fully satisfied and happy."
I definitely recommend this place if you’re anywhere near Fuengirola.
Traditional barbacue food for eating with hands!
nice mexican
"Expensive for tapas and wine, but located in a nice place."
"its is not a bad restaurant in itself, but it's not worth queuing up for."
"Cheap but you can not book,so you have to cue.. catalan food."
We have just come back from a week holiday in Sevilla.
"On one of our first days we discovered this andalusian-cuban restaurant, which was mentioned in our guidebook."
"It took us a little while to find it, because it is in a small and hidden street (""calle"")."
It is not that easy to find restaurants with a good quality-price rating in Sevilla.
"There are hundreds of tapas bars, which are excellent, but if you want to dine at a nice restaurant, trying something different than your usual jamon and tortillas, you might find some difficulties."
"The restaurants are usually quite expensive and most of them are for tourists, so the quality might not be so high."
So when we discovered this little restaurant we got very impressed.
"Don't get misled by the appearances, it looks just about ok from the outside but ...it is a very good place!.The dishes are very tasty but light, which is difficult to find in Sevilla."
"There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, but we tried also some fish and meat based dishes (try the orange salad with codfish) and they were all delicious!"
"Don't miss the tarta de queso (a sort of cheesecake), with honey and cinnamon on top...to die for!"
"We got so impressed by the quality of this place (and the very good price, too) that we ended up going there many other times."
"On our last night the owner offered us a glass of a liquor that, needless to say, was delicious too!"
Highly recommended!
!
Good catalan/fusion food
different... alternative tapas.
"quirky decor, food can be hit or miss depending on the night, very popular with natives of the city which sometimes makes for dour surroundings while you eat."
Good catalan food
The only good thing is the view!
I love this restaurant.
"Great catalan food, nice place."
In summer they put tables on theh street.
good for meat and grilled vegetables
"The place is lovely... A terrace overlooking a tropical garden right in the heart of the beautiful Atocha railway station... Food is OK, you can have a relatively cheap menu or even sandwiches, etc."
Such a pity the staff is so useless... And I've been there several times...
"Slow, forgetful, etc... Too bad..."
"gret ""sandwiches"""
"catalan food, traditional rest."
A Must to Go in BCN
"Too much food on the ""big menu degustació"" but really good"
This place was good years ago but now it has gone to waste.
"The prices have risen out of control and the food is not only served in smaller dishes, but also much worse than it used to be."
This place is now worthless.
"I used to be a semi-regular customer, but now sadly I don't think I will ever come back."
grilled meat...
the restaurant is expensive.
"however, even joe bloggs can afford to eat some mixture of tappas."
"Honestly, the best tappas ever, plus the waiter will tell you if you order over the top!"
!
Good bask tapas
nice snadwiches...
I like it!
moidern food.. expensive...
just go and see!
"local specialties, try the menu del dia..."
"Cozy place, lovely!"
And now with the best nachos con queso!
dirtiest place in town.. but charming!
!
If you like seafood this is THE PLACE in Barcelona.
expensive but great.
Fish quality is ok price wise.
too expensive for the food they serve
"Nice place , nice food, not cheap."
"Tiny little restaurant, in a small passage way."
Must book to dine.
The food is delicious and service very friendly.
You'll even see japanese businessmen in there (usually a good sign).
"Somewhat pricey, but definitely worth it."
great for Sunday vermout!
Cocktails!!!
"En el barrio del born, muy cerca de la Reina, ideal para la copa tras la cena"
"If you are in the area of Malaga-Marbella and happen to be passing through Fuengirola or staying there, you'll find plenty of themed restaurants and loads of pizza joints but we managed to find few nice Authentic Spanish places."
"This one was definitely the best, very busy, with the food on show prior to cooking."
"Lots of choice, and quite cheap as well."
Friendly Staff make things easy.
"A fine restaurant, where vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will have no problems finding enjoyable food"
"Great tapas restaurant in Madrid, not far from Plaza Mayor."
Reasonable priced food with a lovely atmosphere.
There calamares o chopitos were delicious!
and a very large portion for the price.
My other favourite place in San Sebastian for pintxos...
"Delicious fancy pintxos ""nouvelle cuisine"" style."
"Don´t miss the ""foie"", the ""gambas""..."
"Right in the heart of San Sebastian, in the Plaza de la Constitución."
"Always good, especially mix dishes"
Great meat and the best apple cake I have ever eaten!
!
The Perfect one!!
!
Old-rustic spot in Barcelona.
good to get some tapas and drink (cava in particular!)
Fabourite coffee shop in Barcelona.
Fabulous delicatesen desserts
"Beautiful, minimalist space with exquisite European cuisine."
Would compare to French Laundry but a little more low-key.
Definitely recommend for special occasion or romantic dinner; get the chef's menu with the wine pairing to get a great sampling of their best.
"very nice, typical Spanish restaurant in Lanzarote."
It's not cheap but for sure a visit worth.
The food is good.
"typical Spanish Bodega, cool interieur and good local food."
better than most of the other restaurants on the island
"Back when I habitually went out for vermouth on Saturday and Sunday mornings, I went here a few times."
"I'm not sure if it's really a typical vermouth bar; I can't remember if they actually made their own vermouth or not, but I enjoyed it all the same."
"It's a great place for a few drinks and some light snacks due in large part to its incredibly flavorful ambience - below street level, it is truly a bodega unlike so many other Spanish bars that deceitfully use that word to describe themselves."
"My friend who first took me here told me that she frequently went for lunch with her work colleagues, which means it must also have a very good menú del día during the week."
nice tapas in a rustic small bar
This is my place of heaven hoping to get there this year.
It is a wonderful place to chill and the food is out of this world.
I recommend this place to everyone.
What's not to like about it?
The food?
The atmosphere?
The music?
The service?
The price?!!!
Noise i Art brings all of that in spades.
"The menu has something for everyone, ranging from their version of patatas bravas, shrimp and vegetable tempura, chips and guacamole, quiches, empanadas, pastas, chile con carne and veal escalope to name just a few."
"Pretty much everything is well prepared - I've tried many of the menu choices and don't remember not liking anything, but the real star of the show is the restaurant's ecclectic design."
"Funky, fresh pink is everywhere, the table cloth is polka-dotted and made of something like a shower curtain, the hanging lamps at the bar are filled with electric green wax apples and best of all are the brightly-colored IKEA watering cans they serve their sangria from."
"A detail like that shows somebody was really thinking about the whole concept, and I commend them for it!"
"Perhaps all of this sounds gaudy and tacky, but it fits together very well."
"Plus, the music is absolutely phenomenal: you're bound to hear eighties classics like ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and ""Take On Me,"" British pop like New Order and Depeche Mode, and the occasional techno remix of a Vivaldi song thrown in."
"That's assuming, of course, they don't have some other form of entertainment, like a DJ or a Madonna music video marathon projected onto the big screen."
"Since the co-owners always seem to be there, you can expect good service and you can definitely eat well for 20-25 euros."
"When I walk in here, I feel like someone went into my subconscious, withdrew my deepest stylistic affinities and physically materialized them all at once in the form of this place."
"Okay, so I'll admit that it's a bit special, but most people like it."
Every time I've gone out in Gràcia with a group who (wisely!)
"let me choose the restaurant, I've taken them here."
The result has always been pure delight.
"Nit, cosy and confortable place."
Recommended for luchtime.
"Best plates are: ""Juana la loca Salad"" and the ""Chivito"" tipical uruguayan kind of burger (insetead of burger meat, it has a smashed steak filet 3mm thick!)"
Price and quality are to the level.
Attention is fine.
Amazing!
Food & Cava for nothing!
"Always crouwded, very busy."
Lovely setting and the food!
AH!
You drink Galician wine from porcelaine cups and everything is delicious.
Specialty is the rice.
"Great for lunch, not a fancy dinner place."
The atmosfere is good and also the food although I can't compere with the original Thai food.... A little bit expensive
Exotic...but not really authentic.
Great place to have plenty of sea food at very good price.
Suggestion: the earliest you go during the week the fresher the food will be.
House white wine recommended.
"Dont mess the food with ""home-made-mayonese""."
Clams are great as well.
"In a nutshell: Cheap, very noisy and very good sea food."
I prefer to go there and ask to take away.
"Top sea food, top location, top service"
Paella was so-so but sauted prawns were excellent!
Typical cuisine from the city with the best price!
"But the money is not the best thing, the dishes are fantastic, too many tastes unusual in normal tapas-bar."
You've got to be early there because it's always full!
"Restaurante genial, con tapas bien servidas a precios normales."
Con dos o tres tapas ya has cenado.
Sabores muy originales y variedad.
Genial.
Best place to meet favourite friends and have a delicious easy-going beef steak!
"Really nice, but crowded!"
best ensaladilla rusa in town.
muerte por chocolate is just as deadly for your calory balance as it sounds.
they do take-away now.
and it´s a non-smoking place.
many reasons to go....
"Nice food, great place, very good micheladas"
The montaditos are not bad and there is a good buzz in the place
nice place to go and chat with some friends over posh sandwiches and a glass of cava or some apple wine.
You pay by the toothpick (all that's left of the mini tapas) at 1.70 euro's a piece.
No seating inside but fun for a little while.
"I didn't try the main restaurant, it looked a little expensive"
nice food - cool interior - extra point for the view
fashion + playa
Tipical Asturian dishes in a classical asturian restaurant.
Great dishes at very low price.
"Lots of variety, with a strong base on meat dishes."
People with high colesterol might think twice in booking here.
"The place: noisy, smoky and very crowded (gist of the price and quality of the dishes)."
Attention: dont expect to have a somelieur at your side.
"Beautiful interior, looks like a garden inside."
"And I like the food, very good (and spicy)."
Favorite Taps in Spain
like it for lunch time
Best restaurant by far in all Madrid.
"Everyone at La Tasquita take ingredient selection, preparation and service almost as a religion."
"They are passionate about what they do, and that shows in every plate."
Good view of the city from Montjuic and tasty tartar!
!
Touristy but good
Good quality Japanese food.
Large variaty of dishes to choose.
Rather expensive.
The best Japo ever!!
Great food and nice enviorement!
!
Cheap joint.
Full of young people.
"Given the number of remarkably bad restaurants that pawn themselves off as Lebanese in the popular nightlife areas of Barcelona, it would not surprise me if many of the city's inhabitants don't have the best image of this cuisine."
"For the real deal, look no further than Fenicia III."
"Sants might be a bit out of the way, but thanks to places like this phenomenal eatery I can say with great confidence that it is the most underrated neighborhood in BCN for eating out."
"I'll try to recommend certain items, a daunting task since the entire menu is outstanding."
"Their Greek salad is not traditional, as it is dressed with a yogurt garlic sauce and does not have any cucumber, but it is delicious nonetheless and topped with big blocks feta."
"I'm also a huge fan of the Foul, fava beans drenched in lemon juice and olive oil, and one of their hummus dishes is always a must."
"The couscous is right on, served with savory broths and big chunks of meat and vegetables, though be careful, the portions are enormous - one serving is easily enough for two people!"
"You're better off ordering a selection of different dishes and sharing them with your friends, just as you would with tapas."
"When in doubt, ask the waiters, who are very friendly and helpful."
"Whatever you order, make sure you spicen it up with a bit of the homemade harissa and wash it down with a few Almazas."
"A baklava and a healthy dose of mint tea is a great way to round off the experience, which should cost about 20 euros maximum."
"I like esqueixada and pa amb tomàquet as much as anyone else, but I'd die of boredom if I had to eat Catalan food everyday (em sap greu, però és veritat!)."
Lebanese cuisine is the true rockstar of Mediterranean cooking and Fenicia III is as good as it gets.
nice sandwitches & salats
I think its great they are super fast as you normally get your food within  10mins of ordering and the food is fantastic.
I get Pizza to take away from them almost once a week!
"Very good Galician food, try the zamburiñas!"
"Looks a bit ""touristy"", but sincerely, it is great seafood!"
"Very nice atmosphere, good service, nice spanish food."
A lot of choose from the menu.
the most fantastic food ina wonderful setting
"Classical place for very good ""catalan"" tapas."
Too crowded.
The food is not that special and the service is
"Good sushi, good prices, good ambient..."
"quite expensive, sofisticated, food is good but there is too much buzz on this restaurant and I don´t think it deserves it"
like it at night for the cocktails
The best restaurant in Los Alcazares!
Great tapas for a very reasonable price.
It get very busy though.
"Amazing and warm place - generally staff can speak English, even though I do not need."
"Food is wonderful and tasty, I went with a four-friends group twice and we tried almost all the menu, including the famous paellas and the black rice."
"Do try any Cava, you'll regret if you don't - not expensive, very affordable."
"Long lines to have a seat - no reservations possible, come soon and get expected service!!"
!
"Usually nice mexican food, though I think it's not spicy enough."
"And we went there once 15 persons, That I won't recommend, they got to busy, food got cold ect."
BUT VERY NICE COCKTAILS IN HAPPY HOUR!
Different style of the typical chinese restaurant in town
it´s a classic and it´s just great!
it´s sometimes really hard to get a seat though.
but they serve the very best scrambled eggs´n´fries in the world.
mhhhhhhhhh
Great location.
Really awesome fish.
great seafood!
a bit overpriced!!!
for special ocasions ...if you have extra money!
!
"Good food, nice happy colors that live up the place."
Great chocolate deserts
excellent cosmopolitans!
supposedly VERY fancy famous people go there.
Never seen them though.
The interior design is oldish and dark.
Good spanish cusine and not turistic at all.
Went for a work do - was impressed.
"In the old part of the city, a restaurant with a camp atmosphere, fun and nice food"
Great location.
"Food is above average, but chef is very picky."
Very expensive
Expensive but expectacular I recommend go to tapañaki
eat indoor where the grand piano
I've been at Europa Restaurant a few times.
"It was always fantastic, it is one of the Best of Pamplona!"
Good degustation menu esp the egg in a soup
"I haven't been there in ages, but was a very good restaurant, years ago"
Been there many times cause you can have very tasty Spanish tapas.
"Small place, tavern and tasca like and good service."
Semiformal atmosphere to hang out with your friends and spend a good time.
Too posh and expensive
The tasting menu is supeb with Spanish cava and select red wines.
Excellent service.
Very good tapas and dishes.
cucina catalan - most delicious and traditional - just the best!
"Loved the lobster bisque, paella and sauteed prawns"
"Poor cuisine, nice views...and astronomic price."
I wouldn't recommend it to a friend!
"quite expensive, sofisticated, food is good but there is too much buzz on this restaurant and I don´t think it deserves it"
Good japanese food.Hand-rolls are great and prices are fair.
Owned by Brazilians.
Located facing the Alhambra.
Very good tapas and very friendly barman.
Not expensive!
!
Very good it's always full so you have to call in advance
Very nice Tapas place.
Thanks for great service.
Tipical food from the Vasque country.
Variety of pinxtos.
Specilaized on sea food dishes from the vasque cousine.
Recommended dish: lubina a la vasqua.
"Nice, cute and tasty"
The best seafood tapas served fresh.
Dine in the informal bar.
Go early to beat the line.
nice wines from Bodega Los Castanos (the chardonnay!!!!!!).
the place to go to see the actors who are in town for shooting a movie.
"Best Mexican I have tried in Madrid, the margaritas are dangerous!"
Hard to get a table if you have not reserved.
Great for tourists to have a selection of typical tapas with generous portions and decent prices.
Good for groups too.
Overrated.
But the food is good
One of the best japanese restaurants in Spain
It's a very nice place but the waiters and waitresses are AWFUL!!!
"Un lugar muy bonito, pero los camareros y camareras són horribles."
Dan un servicio pésimo.
"I hate using a New York analogy to describe a Barcelona restaurant because I can't stand the arrogance New Yorkers often display when comparing everything they encounter anywhere else with their own city, but in this case it is strangely appropriate."
"So forgive me for being a hypocrite, but La Singular is like something you would see in Greenwich Village."
"The long bar at the front runs alongside a narrow entrance way that eventually opens into a truly lovely and cozy dining room, reminiscent of bohemian Manhattan."
"In a way this does put it right at home with the traditional character of Gràcia, though the neighborhood has unfortunately gotten a bit overrun with generic, gaudily-lit kebab shops nowadays."
"The menu is nothing spectacular, but it is well-prepared with good quality ingredients, and priced very fairly."
"I admit that I haven't been there in years, but what I always remember about it were dishes like goat cheese salad, lamb in mint sauce, and quails preserved in vinegar."
"And the ambiance is even more attractive than the food itself, the red walls and gentle lights create an intimate environment equally appropriate for a first date with a special someone or a Sant Jordi dinner with a long time lover."
"Just remember to make a reservation, otherwise you might find yourself seated at that long bar for quite some time, though if you are with good company there are far worse places to spend your evening."
"Great food, service, atmosphe all in an amazing setting."
And all this only minutes away from San An!
Only nights.
Good choice!
Very good galician dishes.
Vieras are a must but you will have to preorder them (and I think it's just for groups).
The Empanada de Anguriñas is fabulous even if you don't want to eat there and you just want to have a pair of cañas.
Don't miss this classsic placed in La Latina.
"Friendly waiters, but the food isn't so great."
Small volume according to price and preparation of the food could have been somewhat better.
Want to feel like an authenthic Barcelona low-income fashion guy?
Come here for that unique hippie-intellectual-manu chao pseudo-vegeterian barcelona feeling.
And the food is not bad either.
Oh how I miss that.
if you like creps there you find them with all sort of fillings
"Located in ""El Palmar"" just by the lake ""La Albufera"" you can eat there one of the best paellas in Valencia, surrounded by the rice fields and catching sights of the lake and the National Park."
You can also eat local seafood and to get there by car.
It is a 25 minute car ride off the city.
Excellent Basque fare.
We glad me made reservations as it was full for lunch.
It always is!
Perfect dinner in frint the beach!
Very good and no so expensive!!!!!!
!
Excelent food.
Pricey but worth it.
touristy but nice
"Beautiful setting, great food"
Great bar/pub serving happy hour drinks....2 large glasses of wine for only Euro 2!
Bargain....will defo be back.
Nice atmosphere and cheesy old spanish music :-)
"The cocido at La Bola lives up to its fame, although it doesn't come cheap!"
The best in Barcelona
Great restaurant for seafood lovers.
"Not cheap, but inexpensive taking into account the food served."
I would recommend la mariscada a la parrilla.
If you are a meat lover and a great eater you will love it.
It's not my case...
"Okay pinchos, but they never renew their menu."
Also very mass-production.
but love it for meeting up some friends while having montaditos
A real italian restaurant.
Don't need to say much more
"We went on eday at the end of January 2008 for supper to this new and fashionable restaurant, the Ramses Bistro, after making a reservation."
They have a peculiar way of confirming your reservation.
You get an SMS in your cell phone a few hours before your meal.
I find it convenient.
"At our arrival, the only fault was the young woman at the reception."
She was like spending 10' with every client.
"There was a queue, of course."
"When it was our turn, she discovered that we were not on the list."
"In fact, what happened was that the reception was so dark that it was impossible to read the list!"
"After that, all was perfect."
The decoration is by Philipe Stark.
I recommend to go there in the night.
"All is dark, and the light is very well controllled."
I imagine it can be a bit deceiving under daylight.
The menu is very imaginative.
"I recommend the eggs with truffle oil, and an incredible fruit salad they give for dessert."
The wine menu is above average.
You feel like immersed in a very artificial and pleasing atmosphere.
"You can hear a music that goes very well with the decoration, but a music difficult to recognize or describe."
The waiters are exceptionally good.
"Like in the best french restaurants, their main duty is to make you feel at ease."
But all this is expensive.
It could not be otherwise.
170€ for two people.
One of the best places for a typical Spanish (read: no catalan) comida.
Lunch menu is around 12 euros.
Turistic but good
"Visit this restaurant at Espada La Escalera, its at the top of the village and not to be missed, very friendly run family busiiness who cook the most wonderful food, not too expensive either."
"I visited after reading another review and can certainly reccommend the trip up there,"
The Tortilla con salsa brava is a classic you have to try.
"And if you want something different what about a tapa of ""oreja a la brava"""
Genial.
A Chinese restaurant that wants to be good and modern...from my point of view you can go to better places in Barcelona..
Amazing!
The best place in Barcelona to eat rice dishes like paella!
"Would recommend to ask for the terrace in summer or at least at the first saloon, the one that you find at the entrance."
You will feel like you are at a small village from la Costa Brava instead of being in Barcelona...
"A great place to eat tapas at Barceloneta suburb, close to the Barcelona harbour."
MUST try tacos de solomillo and foie a la plancha!
The best japanese restaurant in Madrid.
The best prices for shushi in town.
Lovely
"If you are interested in Modernismo you this restaurant is a Must, where all the artists used to meet in the past."
Food is traditional and good
One of my favorite places to go.
Great food at an even better price!
A real ¨local¨find!
"nice decor, popular with young trendy Catalans, food is fine, maybe a bit pricey."
On our first night in Barcelona the hotel restaurant was closed so we asked for somewhere nice to eat near-by.
"Neyras was recommended by the hotel as a good place to eat, authentically Catalonian and approx 45 euros for a 3 course meal including wine."
45 euros!!!
More like 75 euros - each!!!!!!
"Nice enough food and service but way, way over priced - maybe because all the hotels send their business there?"
Sometimes you do get what you pay for but I am not happy paying for pretentiousness.
We did tell the hotel when we returned and when we showed him the bill he appeared geuinely shocked and apologised profusely.
"Strange thing is despite its hugely-inflated-priced menu, it didnt even seem like the kind of place where people dressed up!"
One of the top Italian restaurants in Barcelona...
"It's always full, and with good reason."
The midday menu is cheap and very abundant
The restaurant in the hotel was clean however the food was terrible.
The quality of the food was very poor and sometimes cold.
"On a number of occassions we found the meats not to be cooked properly, this included chicken."
One of the waiters in the restaurant was very rude & ignorant towards all guests and despite complaining nothing was done to improve our stay.
We will not be returning and certainly would not recommend!
"Great location, great prices, but best of all great decor / atmosphere!"
A Very romantic restaurant where the prices are unbeatable.
"A lovely place is El Palo, friendly warm people, a lovely long beach where the spainish spend all day there, when on their holidays, they put up gazibos and have barbeques on the beach, they take table and chairs with them, it is truely a lovely place."
You dont get many english (not that i dont love the english) but this place makes you feel really special and safe.
"Now for the famous fish restaurant EL TINTERO, the fish is lovely, the atmosphere is electric, family friendly, all those plates of fish makes your mouth water, the wine is very tasty as well."
"This place gets packed, it is well worth a visit or two, or three etc, etc."
This is my review of a truly love place.
We ate at this restaurant on October 25th 2007 ( a Friday evening).
We had no reservations but were seated in a small room below  the main dinning room.
They allow smoking in the basement.
The restaurant was very attractive with a somewhat crazy design and very unusual wall decor.
"Nevertheless, we ordered appetizers, entree, salad, dessert, and a bottle of wine."
We had a very pleasant waitress who spoke perfect English.
The marinated fish appetizer was lacking in flavor and substance(not much fish).
The taco appetizers was great.
"The salad was a typical ""texmexican"" style salad with chopped lettuce and grated cheese on top with tomato dressing."
Then the entrees arrived.
I ordered a spicy chicken dish (24 Euros) which was disgusting.
The chicken had a refrigerated taste and a bit of musty smell.
I sent it back and ordered another taco appetizer.
When the bill arrived they charged for the chicken dish.
I requested to have the amount removed.
The waitress told me she had done all that she could do with the manager.
That he refused to remove the charge.
She seemed frighten to re approach him again.
I requested that he come to the table.
She said he refused.
We spent over 200 Euros and would have been satisfied if the manager had shown some consideration.
It ruined the evening.
If you like sandwiches this is your place.
You will need extra time to read the extensive menu and make a final decision if it's the first time...Jordi Labanda painted the main interior wall
Good prices for more than ok food.
"You can order a la carte, with several entrecots and tournedos for your choosing."
Be prepared to wait a while for a table during weekends.
That's a real destroyer tapas bar.
Very funny!
Nice place noisy groups!
The worst place to ask someone to marry you...
Great restaurant for seafood lovers...quite expensive too!
Really good place to eat really good italian food!!!!
No pizzas served!
Quite good to eat good quality tapas and a bar decorated as they used to be in the past.
It is expensive!
"If you can dig yourself out from the horrors in the resorts, there is a fantastic restaurant up in the hills behind Las Palmas."
Casa Martell is a family-run place which is heaven on earth for carnivores.
"The cordero (lamb) is cooked until it gives up and is like butter, the cerdo affumado (smoked pork chop) is sensational, and best of all the chuleta de cerdo (pork cutlet) is simply the best pig you'll eat."
This chef knows what to do with meat.
The portions are huge - almost too big - and about 12 euros.
"Veggies probably won't be so keen, but there's a decent tapas menu too and they can cobble something together."
"This is the kind of place which, because it's not on the main drag, doesn't get a fair crack of the whip, but it's by far and away the best food I've had on Gran Canaria and well worth the trip."
"If you have room after, try the burbujas de gofio ('bubbles of gofio') which is a mousse made with the local gofio grain - weird but beautiful and about 5 euros for a portion."
They're proud of it and should be.
"The owner is a great guy, and an oenologist by profession."
"He makes his own wine which is decent stuff, and there's a huge choice of Rioja there too."
"He might bring out his home-made liqueurs at the end for a freebie - we tried coffee liqueur and orange blossom liqueur, both of which were amazing."
Enough already.
"Go, and make this guy famous."
Local favorite.
Great sandwiches!
Cool terrasse for summer nights ...
One of the best Galician restaurants in Madrid.
Excellent fish and seafood.
Obviously you must pay for high quality.
"Probably, de best foie in the city... and the tomato, risotto..."
Warning: careful with the red wine and with the wallet.
A bit expensive!!
!
very nice catalan-ish food in Madrid downtown
"I love mexican and this is the best you can expect to get in Spain, they do need to spice it up though"
Beautiful scrumptious tapas.
Best meal in Barcelona.
Chef is Canadian and is a family run restaurant
A very good Italian restaurant!
"Good place to take ""Tapas"" in a different way and in a special place,, nice design in the walls and good price"
"Very small and nice place to take few excellent deep-fried ""tapas"" with a glass of wine or beer."
"If there is no room left, just get in anyway ... people are just stopping by for a couple of ""tapas"" before a real meal."
"Keep the toothpicks because they are used to count how many ""tapas"" you had ..."
fun mexican restaurant great for groups wont break the bank
Great place for tapas.
"love this place, in la latina wonderful tapas but be careful they dont accept credit cards"
"fun galician restaurant great to go in groups, not too pricey and boisterous, rustic atmospehre."
"pulpo is great, try the albarino wine too- downside: they dont accept reservations and there is always a line"
Wow - the 29 Euro menu is just out of this world- Really long queues and a bit of a wait but it is well worth it - YOU would travel to Barce just to eat here again !
!
Best thai in barcelona - but pricey to go with it
"One of the best restaurants in Barcelona... not too expensive,, ideal for lunch,, and the best for a dinner with friends&couple"

Succulent grilled meat and fish.
Great selection of wines.

"Better to book though, it's always packed."
Many excellent lunches one of my all time favourite restaurants
"Different types of food: mediterranean, asian, vegetarian, italian....  Starter, main course, dessert and drink around 20 E."
Skip the chicken and steak - but I swear this is one of the best ox tail stews I have tasted... and reasonably priced too!
"Love the bar designed by Phillipe Starck, very expensive but well made cocktails - try the oyster martinis!"
crowd can be a bit flavio briatore-ish so dont say i didnt warn you...
One of the best places if you like meat...rare meat.
If you cannot speak Spanish go in with some cheat sheets so you can order...as in rare.
"medium, etc."
They do have a menu in English.
"They will first bring out a very tasty plate of chorizo sausages...order their simple hearts of lettuce they drizzle olive oil and sea salt, then you have to get their jamon...and then the steak....cooked perfectly and add a side of red peppers....they are the best in Madrid and you can tell they have been cooking them at a slow pace all day and they fire them up in their wood fired oven just before serving."
When you make your reservation ask to be seated upstairs...they have tables in their basement where you will sit and greet passers-by on their way to the restroom...
the best italian in the city.
"good quality means good prices here.is not possible bookings.don't be late, because after 10pm is impossible get a table."

The Tequila shooters that accompany your check are a welcome touch.
"Very Good, Loved it."
Paeya!
"the best japanese in barcelona, highly recommended!"
it not the cheapest restaurant in Madrid but it is so tipical Spanish cook that I recommend it specially for foreign people.
"By the way, not sure about the English fluency of the waiters, it was hard to understand them even in Spanish :-))"
"One of the King's favorite places...very old school, make sure they do not seat you on the second floor...that means you look like a horrible tourist who will order cheap wine."
Go across the street first and have some tapas at their sister restaurant.
"The steak, of course is excellent."
You might want to save up and get the 91 Vega Sicilia...but anything will go well with the great food here.
The ham and peas...and the white asparagus are outstanding...
"I love this place, even if you just go and ask for a beer they will give you a huge free tapa of fried seafood."
the ham is amazing...
Tapas above all
Good for meetings!
Lovely sea urchins!
fun for cocktails
The place is original and the food vegetarian OK.
"by far the best japanese restaurant in madrid today, expensive but well worth the price- the fish is always fresh and oustanding combinations."
"try the butter fish, toro and an appetizer that has quail egg in it (cant remember what else is in it) you will become and kabuki addict just like me- great for business lunch/dinner, and in summer they have outdoor seating."
good meat
Typical place where people can sit on long rustic wood tables and enjoy a great selection of tasty and copious tapas.
Delicious home-made sangria.
Menus are multilingual but waiters speak only spanish.
15 euros / pers all inclusive.
"Good daily menu, including sushi, tepanyaki..."
Although some dishes are quite poor.
One of the best in town
A bit of a theme with movies but great....eat downstairs...
Good restaurant for a very cheap price.
fantastic salt carriers!
100% pure beef burgers!
!
great portions and ambience
"Good price and good service,, just take a booking sometime before u go,,, Don't forget take a ALBARIÑO (white wine) with the food..."
The food is amazing.
Can only speak of the restaurant.
"The management have a severe attitude problem, starting with our request ( we were a group of 10 who had prebooked the bar for a small function) for separate couple bills at dinner through to an inordinate delay in delivering the bills."
There was a lot of inefficiency in service etc -- Ok that can happen.
The last straw was the staggering arrogance (verging on rudeness) of the management team.
"There are so many places to choose in Nerja that people don't need to submit themselves to xenophobic offence -- by the way, our group are all residents of Spain living locally and have no language problems."
"Service was appallingly slow, but that was overshadowed by the attitude of management."
Avoid!!
They showed the worst side of Spain and I hope that visitors to this country will be able to patronise the many welcoming and charmingly run establishments instead.
The hotel restaurant 111 is the worst restaurant I have ever come across.
We were a group of 14 girls ranging from early our 20's to 50's and were looking for somewhere really nice to eat as it was a special occasion and we were prepared to pay higher prices.
"Having spotted the tasting menu for 39.00 euro the majority of us were opting for this, which sounded very nice."
"A few were ordering of the A la carte menu and two more fussy eaters had arranged for chicken, not on the menu."
The first clue when we entered the restaurant was that it was empty apart from one other table on an elsewhere busy night.
The waiting staff seemed unexperienced but polite.
When the first course arrived 'mushroom & crab' the dish was minus the crab and had the most horrible slimy freezing cold mushrooms.
When we asked about the crab it was brought out 10 minutes later on a seperate tiny dish with about a teaspoon of crab.
We were given an excuse that it was a new chef who had only been there one week and had forgotten to add the crab.
We advised the waiter we did not want the starter served as such so he offerred to re-do them.
While he took the plates away one of our group heard the wiater asking the other in spanish ' how will we know which plate belongs to who' and he was told to 'shut-up'.
The dish did re-appear 20 minutes later simply mixed together.
"No-one in our party could eat this dish, despite trying it and making an effort."
"The same delays followed and half an hour later we were being served the second coarse which had an almost raw egg yolk with a cold scallop, which was also revolting."
When this was yet again sent back we were offerred a glass of cava and yet more bread rolls.
The next dish of cod and fig jam was just as bad and becuase some of us had actually attempted to try this we were later told we had touched it and would have to pay for it.
At this point we had just had enough.
I went to speak to the manager and a gentleman with glasses presented himself.
I told them we were only prepared to pay for the dishes we had eaten and explained what we had overheard with the waiters.
He would not agree to this so another manager appeared who was polite initially but soon took the tone as the previous manager in that they were only interested in getting paid.
At this point I actually asked them to call the police as I felt the food was appalling and the customer service was disgracefully an I was not prepared to pay.
"In the end we agreed to pay 50% only because it was a special occasion and this restaurant had already spoilt the most part of the night, I didn't want to be stuch there for another few hours."
I had such a bad experience here I did not want anyone else's holiday to be ruined as our's had been.
We had much nicer food in restaurants alot cheaper than this one.
"Terrible service, rude management, food not as on menu description, would not recommend this hotel restaurant."
"Having ate in other Meridien hotels, I was hoping the restaurant at the Meridien Barcelona would live up to the same high standards."
I am afraid to say it failed miserably.
"We were over for a long weekend to celebrate a forthcoming wedding, hen weekend so to speak."
"Mixture of ages, 14 of us, all well travelled ladies."
I must say I have never been treated with such lack of respect in all my travels.
"Most of us had decided on the taster menu, a sample of two starters, two mains and a desert for €40."
"The first starter course was served without half of the ingredients, namely crab and when this was pointed out the waiter apologised and brought us out small bowls of crab."
We told them that this was totally unacceptable and that we wished for fresh starters to be brought.
"When they were served everyone felt that they were not fresh, as the lettuce had the sauce through it, which was previously surrounding the plate, very suspicious."
No-one ate this course and I had to ask twice to get the waiter to take it away.
"Second starter crayfish was brought out some time later, it was fine."
The 1st main dish was cod.
"Cod is supposed to flake when cut into as far as I am aware, not be chewy."
No one ate this course.
"At this stage we had been in the restaurant for 2 ½ hrs, we were all very hungry as all we had to eat was a small portion of crayfish and bread rolls."
"Some of the ladies had not ordered the taster menu and they had been brought their main courses and had finished them, some had to send theirs back as it was not what was on the menu and bits were left out."
The waiter apologised again and explained that there was new kitchen staff.
We decided that we had had enough of bad service and uneatable food and asked to speak to the manager and settle our bill.
"The restaurant manager met with us and I explained the situation, his attitude was you order the food you have to pay for it."
We told him this was totally unacceptable and that we wanted to speak to the hotel manager as this would reflect on them.
"That lady arrived, in fairness she tried to work out a compromise with us of €20 for the 2 starters."
I pointed out that we had not ate the 1st one and that €10 would have been more of a compromise.
"They called security, who stood guard on the door and informed us that if we did not pay the bill then they would call the police."
"What do you do, in a foreign country trying to compromise over bad service and poor quality meal…we paid the bill."
"The fact that I had no alcohol consumed as I am pregnant, this dissatisfaction could not be put down to me being under the influence!"
What I would say is that the management could have dealt with this situation with much more decorum and treated us with a bit more respect.
The whole experience did put a dampener on our first night in Barcelona!
So if you are looking for lovely food and good service this is not the restaurant for you!
"Just got back from Barcelona.Loved the place but had a few negative experiences.We knew going in the dollar was puny vs the Euro but the reality of this is much more depressing.Eating a typical salad ,soup and sandwich meal is going to set you back more like 40-50$ than the hoped for 15-20.its apparently customary in restaurants in Spain and I guess elsewhere in Europe to bring bread or olives to the table whether requested or not and to hose you to the tune of 4-5 bucks.We were used to this but really got PO'D at the Restaurant Cal Pinxo on the waterfront.Knowing that we were already going to be hit up for the bread we asked for some butter.Two foiled wrapped pats were delivered.We were aston ished to find out that they charged us 4.90 Euros for the 2 pats.Close to 7-8 bucks for the butter alone.The total was over a 100$for 6 oysters.One glass of table wine,one beer ,a small salad and a cup of soup.This rip-off meal added to being pickpocketed earlier on the metro stairs ruined an otherwise pleasant day.Pickpocketting is rampant and apparently not even regarded as a crime .I'm a fairly experienced traveler and having been to France(including Paris,) many cities in Italy ,all over Central America and Mexico as well as Peru and other supposed petty crime havens."
"The usual commonsense precautions have always been effective,In Barcelona this isnt the case as hordes of pickpockets will brazenly start opening any pocket or zipper without fear of reprisal.Having said all this I still think Barcelona is a vibrant ,wonderful city.We stayed in thye Tryp Apolo near the Ramlas.We found it very friendly and efficient.Rooms were fine .It may not have old world charm but I expect to visit those and not sleep in them .Memorable meals were at the food stalls in the Boqueria market and a place called Foro on Princesa street in the Born district."
"The pizzas are HUGE and very nice, but I wouldn't say they are the best I've had in Barcelona."
"Still pretty good, though."
"Do remember to book ahead, especially on weekends"
"Traditional Italian restaurant, good prices."
"Make a reservation on time, because it is always full."
"This is a traditional Spanish restaurant, with all that comes with it: professional service but a bit formal; and decent food."
"The paella was good, the Catalan lamb chops OK. Clean and efficient."
Nice old fashioned atmosphere.
"Not cheap, but not outrageous either."
"Nice atmosphere, good japanese food."
"GATE TO INDIA  Elviria , marbella ."
12 th march 2008  What a find .
An excellent indian restaurant in Elwira just a short drive or cab from Puerto Banus or Marbella.
Fantastic selection of dishes to choose from and has a great atmosphere with a contempory feel .
Not a bit of flock wall paper in sight !!
Very clean and welcoming .
The owners are a couple of brits Gemma & Craig ( just having their first baby but still working their socks off ) who are just great at what they do .
Food was excellent not all the same texture and colour like so many Indian restaurants.
Our friends who are a pair of Indian experts raved so much we went back for a second meal on a one week holiday ...it was that good.!
"!Give it a go , it may take a little finding but well worth it and it wont bankrupt you like alot along the coast line ."
Keep up the good work Gemma & Craig .
They even do take aways.
"The address is  GATE TO INDIA,PINO GOLF,DON CARLOS, LOCAL 29, MARBELLA .....PHONE 951 310 180"
The set menu is is a 2 of 10 and the wine menu is okej BUT the service is absolut worst ever and iam not pickie.
Spilled a bottle of red wine all over the table an on all my cloths with out saying sorry - just upps!
those things happens !
Sure but spraying some cleaning spray all over my clothes and my food okej sure could live with that but the shirt didnt come clean.
But after the dinner ( had to sit at the same table throw out the hole dinner with out changing the linnen - quite a mess) This is when you dont know if to start lavfing just go ?
Finally at the cashier the say Sorry for the first time because they could fix the shirt.
Told me to leave it and get it clean or send my some money for it.
Three weekslater nothing not answering emails nothing.
Best of all was that they handed over the full bill/check att the same time without no compensation at all.
This is not a chep restaurant but it is possible to leave there EUR 300 short and with out your favorite Prada shirt.
It was a frezzing walk back to the fantastic hotel 1898 on the ramblas - Strogly rekomends it.
"There's nothing really extraordinary about this Indian restaurant, but given the abundance of mediocre competitors nearby, it stands out from the crowd"
"Stylish restaurant, a nice meal for a very nice price."
Recomend this also for groups.
The food is good and the location is unbeatable
"Good food, bad service"
Lhardy has been in business serving traditional Castilian food for 150 years.
It was recommended by both Fodor's and Frommer's.
"Given its rather expensive menus (30-40 Euros for main dish) and such publicity, we enter the restaurant with fairly high expectations, which was further enhanced by the restaurant's very elegant and eclectic decor."
We were disappointed that cocido was not available.
"We settled for roasted veal and roast beef, since Castile is also known for its roasted meals."
The portion was more than enough (we had no room for desert as planned) but what great disappointment.
The roast veal tasted like some glorified cafeteria food --- tasted just a tad creamier than or almost exactly like the roasted pork in this creamy cheese sauce that I get in the cafeteria at my work.
"My wife's roast beef is just marginally more decent, but not spectacular, as matter of fact even slightly cool when served (according to recipe?)."
The service was excellent --- so much attention showered on you that you hardly have a chance to pour your own drinks --- until you ask for the check --- we waited 45 minutes before it was brought to us despite having asked for it repeatedly.
"Given the amount you spent, you probably would be more satisfied going to Botin as Hemingway would have done or sit down at a tapas bar for one-third the price and a better gastronomical experience."
Nice design with excellent food is not easy to find!
!
Good quality for low prices.
Do not go there if you expect top notch service...
"Wow.. Amazing food, excellent service, the decor was ok but not spectacular, but this restaurant has definitely got it where it counts."
The waiters were very attentive and explained each dish to us as well as giving us an extra pudding for free!
"We went for the 35 euro menu, and it was perfect."
"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to, without a doubt."
"I would recommend this place to anyone - just beware that it opens 9pm, so have a late lunch!"
"Address: c/ Aribau, 100 08036 - Barcelona Tel: 93 454 52 01  www.osmosisrestaurant.com"
I went to this restaurant invited to a birthay.
We were a party of 10 people.
All the Catalonian specialities are in the menu.
"We start with some aperitives, and the best one was ""Anxoves de L´Escala"", all were delecious, but this one was superb."
"All the main meals were excellent and I ate ""the sunday roast"", this dish was the traditional meal for the workers on Sundays, it consist in a piece of chicken, pork ribs and a veal meatball all accompanied with apricot and plum sauce."
The dessert was a cake and it was also excelent.
"The housewine, also from Catalunya, was perfect for this celebration."
"I am used to the prices of Majorca, and I was really surprised about the price, I found it so cheap, only 25 euros/person with drinks and cofees."
This restaurant gives you the opportunitie to discover the local food with a good value for money.
"The restuarant is part fo the hotel ""Banys orientals"" in the old town of Barcelona."
Enjoy it.
The best bravas I have tasted.
"Some years ago there was a waiter who recited poems, and I would score it with 4 stars, but now he isn't there and seems each time more dirty."
"But the bravas, five stars, for me."
If you find this small restaurant in a stone village - a stones throw from the Pyrenees you'll not be disappointed.
The lunch menu (closed Tuesday) is around 10 euros for 3 courses and offers 'new' Catalan (sea & mountain) cuisine.
Carles (who trained in Edinburgh) gives classic Catalan dishes a modern (no nonsense) glaze.
"There are decent (local) wines available and the carte (menu) is excellent (150 euros for 4 people, 3 courses inc. wine & coffee)."
"It's real, well prepared and local."
Not far from Dali's Figueres and Girona.
Don't miss the tepanyaki tables!
!
"Skuffende når kelneren bare deler forretten du har bestilt med gjesten din uten å spørre deg, spesielt spør du meg, ikke bare forretten også den deilige Sautrernen som skulle følge med den aller dyreste retten på menyen!"
OSTIAS!!
"Kjøttet på den lille geita fra oppe i fjellene var nydelig, men tilbehøret var så som så."
The besgt pizza in town by the Guggnheim Museum
"If you are visiting Costa Teguise, don't miss this restaurant for wonderful food and great service."
"Located in a small row of bars/shops almost opposite the hotel Coronas Playa just to the south of the Costa Teguise, it is easily missed amongst the neighboouring bars offering english breakfast and sky TV, but it is amongst the best restaurants on the island."
"Keeping to a smallish menu it managed to offer great food that was fresh, beautifully cooked and presented."
Make sure you are hungry because portions are generous and you need room for dessert!
Just perfect.
It was an excellent surprise when I found a so excellent restaurant in the MUSEU NACIONAL D'ART DE CATALUNYA
Very nice restaurant near the sea.
Very good food.
A little bit expensive
"Good place,eat well, drink better and the waiters are very friendly"
"If you are not eager to try foods typical from the region, then head to this excellent Argentinian restaurant."
"A bit too formal but you can always choose to sit on the terrace on the promenade, while watching the tourists go by."
"The pizzas, meats, pastas, salads... everything's delicious."
I love this restaurant.
"Nice place, easy for parking, and young dishes, as pasta, tiny salads, sandwiches and hamburgers."
"Good and fast service, and outside tables to spend a relaxing afternoon in spring!"
my favourite peruvian restaurant.
"Try the 'papa rellena' 'ceviche' 'picante the camarón', 'anticuchos', 'causa limeña' and 'tacu tacu' with a pisco sour to drink"
reasonable price/nice and tidy
"Great atmosphere, delicious crepes & salads."
definitely going back!
"i think it belongs to the same owner as the one in Calle belén, which is the one i like."
"I always recommend Passand Chiken, rice with veggies and Lamb Bhuna."
"And for dessert i like Kulfi, which is an indian ice cream."
None of these too spicy.
Poor price/quality ratio
I love their gazpacho and garlic soup combo.
So freshing in hot summer.
"The bread, the olive, the main course... every detail deserves the Michelin recommendation."
"It is a ""must go"" if you visit this historical old town."
mexican cantina where you may order diner after 23:30 hrs which is quite convenient.
food not too bad
good for a quicky
And best nachos too!!!
Excellent decoration
Good place for 'tapas' and wine.
May get a bit crowded and noisy

Mexican restaurant.
"My favourites: 'Flautas', 'Queso con Huitlacoche'-did i spell that right?- , 'chalupas, 'cochinita pibil', 'tacos al pastor' and 'nachos'."
The chef is nuts and he'll come out of the kitchen from time to time and probably say something cheeky to you.

"great location, intimate and stylish, great food"
It is the only Filipino restuarant I've found in Barcelona.
"I think it's funny that they have 2 separate menus one for the locals and tourists (non-filipino) and another just for their Filipino customers, which is written in Tagalog."
"Some of the dishes are quite good and remind me of mom's kitchen, but others are prepared quite differently from what I'm used to- overall a pretty good place to get lots of food."

when your fangs itch for an argentian meat quicky
"An outstnading ""argie"" if you want a good steak and feel like you are in Argentina."
Great service but not cheap.
Lovely vasque family restaurant.
The food is good but the best thing is that it's perfect if your looking for a quiet place as it's divided in different areas.
Good for family reunions or work meetings and don't miss their 'tamborrada'!
"Nice family restaurant, with a romantic atmosphere, which no longer exists as it was bulldozed down to make apartments."
"Nice paellas, though not the best."
"The peculiar thing is that is like eating inside a greenhouse, which makes it different to other places"
one of the best restaurants in madrid.
traditional food
One of my Madrid favorites.
"Not for a meal, but for a bloody good beer and Madrilenean tapas."
I have been frequenting this place for over 3 decades.
great tapas.
book well in advance
tasty brazilian buffet
I really loved it.
Real good food and wonderfull wines.
Madrid's most renowned Café.
"Best restaurant in Barcelona for Catalan food, a magestic place, pricy but worth the visit."
"We went to this restaurant on the night of 28/03/2008, our first night in Palma."
We had no reservation.
We saw the restaurant was quite empty.
"The lady manageress said that the empty tables were all reserved and that we would have to sit upstairs by the fish tank (3 sickly fish) and near the top of the stairs in the smoking section- we were told this was the last table in the restaurant, though we told her that we were both non-smokers."
We asked for wine but no water.
The wine waiter (for such he said he was- he would have no truck with helping us order our food) poured my wine into my water glass and my partner's wine properly.
He took away my wine glass.
He then departed.
He then returned suddenly and tried to take away my water glass as I hadn't ordered water.
I said he'd poured my wine into the water glass.
"He then said, without apology and with a breathtaking arrogance that he wanted the water glass now and would bring me a wine glass- he then stood over me until I had drunk my wine."
A couple came in after us and were seated next to us.
The lady manageress approached them and said she'd just been told that they were non smokers and though they said that they had no reservation she said to them that a table was available for them downstairs in the non smoking section.
Same sex couples beware of sub standard treatment.
I asked for fried baby squid as a starter.
A small pile of batter bits arrived which as far as I could determine contained nothing.
I ordered a risotto which was so salty as to be wholly inedible- I was told that it was the basic fish stock being used that night.
When the bill came we'd been charged for water.
We'd also been charged for two small stale bread rolls- £2-50 for that order!
"To put the situation in context, my partner had no starter."
"He had a main course that was little in portion but he thought was delicious.The grilled fish with my risotto was also delicious, although again minimal in portion."
"The wine was local and tasty but horrendously expensive, though in fairness nearly all restaurants make their money that way."
We paid the bill without complaint but didn't tip- they lost more than they gained.
Unjustified arrogance and attitude throughout.
It's a fine place.
"I'm not sure it quite lives up to its reputation, or if it's worth queuing up for."
But it's fine.
"Four adults arrived for ""lunch"" at 3:00pm and La Finca was lively and crowded with diners."
"The menu del dia had 3 choices with something for everyone..meat, fish or vegetarian."
"A lovely salad, a glass of wine, choice of dessert."
"We were all very pleased with the white tablecloth ambiance, good service, generous portions and importantly...Reasonable price of $14US pp, despite our pathetic US$ being at 1.60 Euros."
"Well worth it, even by Boston standards."
"Probably one of the best ""Cocido"" in Madrid."
A bit more expensive but worth it.
"If you love fish, the place to go"
The food was dreadful & no atmosphere.
When we left most of the food the waiter just shrugged!
We had to ask 4 times for bread.
Starter and wine ok but mains horrible.
Worst meal in Valencia and most expensive at £100 for lunch for 2.
Go to La Riua in centre for wonderful paella instead.
Submarino is a restaurant resting on its laurels because of the novelty factor of the fish.
Really good Thai food!
What can I say about my favorite restaurant in Soller?
"The restaurant is placed in ""playa den repic"", to come it is necessary to take the detour of just before the tunnel that goes towards to the port ."
Behind the restaurant you will find a car park.
"The restaurant opened more than 50 years ago, belonging to the same family at present What to eat?"
"My fauvorite plate are the ""gambas of Soller"", grill or carpaccio."
"My tipp, if you ask for grill, don´t forget to suck the head, they are delicious (that´s true)."
"The best is follow the recomendations of Angeles or Anais(mother and Daughter), they always have a good recomendations."
"If you don´t like fish, you can also go there, they cooked a nice paella or lamb shoulder."
Finally!!
"It only took five nights but my husband and I finally had a good meal in Barcelona.To top it off, it had good service as well!"
We were told that this is the best restaurant in all of Barcelona.
We didn't find the price overly exorbadent either.
"Actually, our dinner here was less than at another restaurant with lousy food and service."
"Anyhow, the shellfish platters looked just superb."
I had Dorado which was great.
My husband who won't eat anything with fins or gills said if all fish was like that he would eat it.
He had some sort of beef that cooked exactly how he ordered it.
The Cava (Rose') was great as well.
The service was impeccable.
The other patrons I found were friendly as a bonus Definitely recommended!
The best Sushi in Barcelona
This used to be one of my fauvorite restaurants but no more since the owner changed into a restaurant chain.
The service is now terrible and they make feel you as in a fast-food restaurant.
Nice tapas anyway.
"It's OK... A good choice if you're in Passeig de Gracia and want to eat cheap, since the pintxos system allows you to control your expenditure, and most other restaurants in the area are expensive."
the steaks are fantastic
"It's not altogether bad, but there are better and cheaper indians in the area"
A mythical bar of the Madrid nightlife... greasy burgers and sandwiches that taste like food from the heavens when the munchies set in!
One of the best Chinese restaurants in Madrid.
"Both the food and the service are really good, and the maitre d' is a charming man."
"It is worth it to visit the Cap de Creus, the landscape is amazing, you need a car to go there, no public transport."
"Although the restaurant is placed is such a beautiful spot, be careful that the owner is not in a bad mood."
Our visit to the place was completely spoiled by his aggressive welcome.
We were thinking to have a drink and eat later on in this restaurant but we felt very disappointed.
There was no reason for such a situation.
We were advised by other friends that this could happen.
Anyway I guess we need to experience things by ourselves.
nk
"Menneen maailman tunnelmaa, mahtavaa tarjoilijatyöskentelyä & upeat ruoat."
"Good place, but I prefer its brother, Arabia, in c/Piamonte"
I would warn all non-Spanish speakers that go to this place that we found that the English menu has higher prices than the Spanish.
"After enquiring about this, the maitre got extremely aggressive and offered some sort of explanation, where the market price of seafood varies and they dont update the English menu as often, later to discover that the dessert menu had the same problem, I guess chocolate prices also fluctuate in this global world!!"
"Leaving all this behind and forgetting about money issues since great food has no price, the food was very average and not for a place of 120 USD/head."
I was looking for a good sushi restaurant while vacationing in Malaga.
I saw this restaurant advertised in the back of a magazine and the ratings were fantastic.
The place looked nice inside but the sushi was terrible.
The duck entree that my sister ordered tasted more like beef with raman noodles.
The only saving grace was the ravioli dish that my friend ordered.
I almost forgot to mention that they charged us for bread that we never ordered and brought us the wrong bottle of cava (twice as expensive) and charged us for it.
"Overall a very bad experience, I do not recomend this place to anyone."
"It's not that easy to find a comfortable, traditional tapas bar in the lively Chueca area at 9:00pm, where you are not fighting for an elbow spot at the bar,and choking on 2nd hand smoke."
"We liked El Bocaito and enjoyed an interesting variety of tapas, 2 rounds of draft beer (cañas) & wine for four people, all while standing at the tapas bar."
$28US seemed reasonable enough.
"Constant and reliable, I've been several times there and always ate very well."
Good Risottos and great desert crêpes
"I had thought this place might be a tourist trap because I had been there 30 years ago with ""a group""."
Not so!
It is popular with the locals and we had to make reservations for Saturday night two days in advance.
"We had a cozy room with just a few other small tables, nice wine list, several different kinds of paella (their specialty), good service, good food, reasonable price."
"Really good food, can't remember what we ate but was delicious."
Good interior design
A classic for sandwiches in the centre of Barcelona.
But it's important to avoid the hours when the queues are longest
"Do not go to Chill-Out restaurant located in Playa las vistas, Los Cristianos, Tenerife."
"I was there last week enjoying a paella, it was good until I discovered a cockroach on the spoon!!"
"disgusting, isnt´ it?"
"the cooker did not apologize, neither the owner, the poor waitress was the only one who said sorry."
"They did not charge us the drinks, oh great..."
I did not eat anything that day anymore... when we asked them to do a complain they said they do not have the documents available...
I do not recommend this place AT ALL!
The location is fantastic
"Good value, rustic, good for meat"
"I lived nearby for two years, and they opened it just before I moved, so I only got to try it once; but it was good, I'll probably return if I find myself in the area again."
"Good italian food, big dishes"
The best bravas I have tasted.
"Some years ago there was a waiter who recited poems, and I would score it with 4 stars, but now he isn't there and seems each time more dirty."
"But the bravas, five stars, for me."
I was disappointed by this.
"It had been recommended to me, but I found that the food was acceptable but nothing special, and a bit too pricey."
"In any case, there are not a lot of its kind in Barcelona to choose from"
"It's OK, but I don't think it's worth the price"
"Nice food, cheap and good service"
We ended our 2 week trip to Spain with a dinner at El Pimiento Verde.
"This place looks like any typical bar or restaurant, but you definitely don't want to pass this place up."
The food is great and the service is very friendly.
"Be sure to order their Sangria, Garlic Shrimp, and of course, the Jamon Iberico."
It's a little pricey at €19 but so worth it!
"My only complaint was that this restaurant was very smokey, but this is typical of any place in Madrid."
I took my wife here to celebrate her *0th birthday.
It did not disappoint.
"The service was excellent and the food well paced, well presented and delicious."
We had been looking forward to going to El Paraguas for some time but generally it is very busy at weekends.
We went on a Tuesday and managed to get a table that day.
Lunch among the Madrid Gen X.
Good Place for lunch (2:00-4:00).
"Lively ambiance, convenient location."
Menu del Dia has good choices for 3 courses and a price that stretches your weak US dollar.
(<$14pp).
This restaurant was recommended by the hotel staff on our fourth night here in Barcelona.
I don't know what the problem is but we are striking out big time here.
This restaurant started out promising but once the interaction started with the waiter it ended.
First there was inability to make a recommendation of a house specialty.
"(I should have prefaced this by we are not dining rookies, we are not cheap AND I have friends who own restaurants) All he did was review the menu."
I can read.
"When my husband ordered the lamb, it was then we were informed of what menu items were not available."
Strange given that it was in the beginning of the dining hours.
Whatever.
I made the BIG MISTAKE of ordering beef (I was hungry after being sick for 2 days from another dining experience).
What is medium here in Barcelona is not medium by French standards and especially not USA standards.
I would have called it raw.
There was raw meat surrounded by rare meat.
When it was sent backed (I know the chef was horrified but who cares at ~32 euros) I know they only threw more truffle sauce on it to cover it up.
"Then silly us for inquiring if they happened to have a rose' cava ( this was certainly off menu), answer: ""NO."""
Plain and simple.
At least they got my dessert right.
Couldn't say the same for husbands though.
"When the bill came, there was a charge for the olives that were placed on the table and there was the third entree charge (only 2 of us dining)."
How indignant the waiter was when it was brought to his attention.
And people criticize the French?
I have eaten in various parts of France over the course of 10 years and NEVER had this type of experience.
Thank God I am returning to France in July!
!
My happy place.
Possibly the freshest & the best tapas in the world.
This bar is cheap and the food is delicious.
No wonder it's always packed
Muy bueno y al dueña es una maravilla de mujer
Shoko is both a fusion of Asian and Mediterranean food and a fusion of a restaurant and club.
The black and red Japanese decor lit by candles and interspersed with a bamboo 'forest' within which to dine makes a big impact on arrival.
"The service is attentive and helpful, and the food is delicious."
The beach terrace has red sofas and parasols where you can enjoy a drink before dinner.
"At the sound of the gong after dinner, the staff transform the restaurant into a great club where you dance until 3am."
Friendly atmosphere where locals and tourists enjoy each others company to some superb music.
A really good evening out.
An quite decent Japanese place.
"Don't miss the roasted tuna, it's delicious"
Wonderful.
Freshest fish ever.
"nice restaurant, live jazz on tuesdays (I think)"
Very spicy :)
Unbeatable bang for the buck

"Good marketing skills, beautiful presentation, professional welcoming."
"I went to La Bodeguilla twice, in Jan & again in Mar, for work purposes."
"The first time was better - fantastic food, great service, and the manager was very helpful in answering my questions (it was a potential venue for a business dinner)."
We were offered complimentary desserts and tasters.
"What surprised me about this restaurant is that they were willing to let a group choose from the a la carte menu, instead of insisting on Set Menus, as most places do, when catering for larger groups."
"The second time was good, we had some privacy upstairs (although I think the one toilet in the whole restaurant was too close to people eating)."
The service was good.
"The meat seemed to be a far better option than the fish, according to colleagues."
"They have private wine cellar, but I wouldnt recommend it for pre-dinner drinks: it's absolute tiny, and the seats are actual barrels."
"I would recommend this place for a corporate/personal dinner, definitely!"
"Very cozy restaurant in the heart of the Old Town.Need to reserve.Very good ""paella valenciana""."

Best old school restaurant in town!!
!
"Good decoration, bad food"
I've been there only once.
The food was great and service very good.

They also have a special menu to try as several dishes.

Tom boran (Coconut soup) is delicious
Really expensive!!

Exquisite.
"A little too expensive, but it's worth it."
6 years ago was great!
Now is BAAAD!
Great atmosphere!
One of the best and most authentic Mexicans you can find in Europe.
And a very reasonable price to match
is not what it used to be!
Too traditional...
"Really good Italian food, but terrific atmosphere..."
Great little family run bar that serves the customary plate of tapas every time you order a drink (thank god for the free tapas culture!).
They even serve some home-made liquors!
Definately worth a stop during an evening out on the town.
too snop!

"Nice deco, quality food, bit pricey."
It is a teaching restaurant.
"However, the fact that food is prepared and served by students does not mean that the quality of food and service is bad."
"On contrary, food is very-very tasty, the portions are generous (especially during working days in the evenings) and the stuff is extremely polite with clients."
Fish dishes are absolutely amazing.

A must.
Same owners as El Granaino.
It is a very special place.
A nice place for firsts dates and also perfect for going with friends.
This is a very nice Indonesian restaurant held by real Indonesians.
They had a similar but much bigger restaurant before in the Netherlands and came here to Spain.
They made this one much more human size and created a very nice atmosphere.
"The food is perfect, you have a large choice of Indonesian specialties, but if you don t know what to take, I recommend the rice table which is a palette of everything, great to discover."
Meat is excellent and brownie yummy.
Premises not classy but quality and price are worthy
Bad service
typical american
"Good food, good decoration (with a sand living-room downstairs) and handsome waiters!"
Great place for good seafood and a great Paella.
The lunch menu is very reasonable and gives big helpings.
"There is seating on the front terrace, right on the beach, or you can even sit inside where the interior is build to mimic a ship!"
Its real eye-candy.
"Crabs, lobsters, and shellfish adorn the various open tanks in the interior, so you can be sure what you're getting is fresh."
Perfect service in a good ambient.
Make a reserve for the tables upstairs.Good paella and delicious desserts.
good not expensive mexican food!
young ambient

Great restaurant!!
Very good quality of food!!
Good service!
"Defenetelly, I recommend it!"

WOW!
"sit back, have some wine, and have a carne a piedra."
Good coocking not expensive but booking is not allowed and usually you must wait in a cue.
"Adding, waiters are not the best."
Overrated japanese restaurant.
The place is great but the price is excessive for the quality you actually get.
Hanaita in Palma is much less classy but has top fish quality.
"One of my favourites, fantastic food and extense menu"
Good for tapas on Sunday!
"Very tipical ""Casa Asturiana"" with a very good cuisine."
great place to have typical cataln food!

Power lunch.
Great tasting menu with wine pairing.
Food is OK and fairly innovative.
Service is poor.
don't go!
"Very nice location, but toooo expensive..."
GReat place!
"Although, it is not what it used to be..."
traditional place
Best patatas bravas in Town!!!!
Big big difference!
!
"easy&fast,good mojitos&nachos.more tex-mex that real mexican but mmmh"
everything was pretty good.
"however, chicken was undercooked."
Good place!
How about some fish with a side of fish?
Forget the veggies (dont have any) or the fries (dont have any).
Order an Albariño with the Lenguado.
Best Tapas in town!
Long cues to get in!
Expensive!
Ate here twice in 2 weeks.
"The seafood tapas were very tasty, but also enjoyed the fried artichokes and peppers."
Get in line early to get a spot at the counter- it's the only way to eat here if you don't have reservations weeks in advance.
horrible italian restaurant!
They should close it!
"Fantastic food, great service and very good atmosphere"
Best tapas in Barcelona (if you don't mind the price)
"Delicious Arroz Caldoso, Beautiful Paellas, whatever you want thats under the Spanish sun, this restaurant dishes it up to perfection."
"We went during winter, but in the summer months you can even dine infront of the restaurant, next to the picturesque Cathedral in the center of town."
"Friendly service, reasonable price."
We will definately be going back.
"Excellent ""bar de tapas""."
"Try the ""Secreto Iberico""."
very good for typical catalan food!
Take a beer and they give you some meal
Amazing place.
Tipycal Italian restaurant.
"It is authentic, but you need to book a table or you will wait outside."
Best italian in Madrid
Go with friends and eat like pigs!
xD
On eof the top fish restaurants in BArcelona.
SOmthing more original than Botafumeiro!
Great quality of products!Do not miss it!
!
5+ stars - it is an institution!
"The best Bodegeguita, Spanish ham and wine!"
Come early or get squashed!
!
"Very nice restaurant in the Prado museum zone.Wonderful patio inside, and excellent paella."
I went with my colleague in a lunch&working.
"The ""normal"" lunch room is quite noisy, but there is a possibility to get a ""reservation"" lunch room :D Tipically ""the tapas"" verduras a la plancha, pescaditos, esgarrat, chipirones con ajitos tiernos .. and the main course: pallea valenciana, all kind of cooked-meats."
"Deserts: Panacota de leche con fresas, flan de almendras, crema catalana"
Not bad.
"Too noisy but they have a closed menu at nights per 22 euros, althought in the end you will pay 35!!"
The food is ok.
very good!
Nice atmosphere...
"Whilst the interior looks the part, the food served is very plain and the service is slow."
"To top things off, you get ripped off here easily."
Avoid it.
too expensive
Best food experience
one of the top!
Sea food and baskian cousine!
Great Paella!
But is better to go to the one next door; Cal Pinxo PLatja.
Nicer terrace!
"Excellent restaurant, spent a few nights here watching the plaza and its people."
Great view over the port!
"location, very nice!"
good price
Best steaks in Marbella!
Don Carlos is a must-have for dessert :-D
I holidayed in Salou in Spain in August 2007.
This was the nicest restaurant in the resort.
The hostess was so friendly and accommodating.
"They served steak which was melt in the mouth, lovely pasta dishes and pizzas."
With dishes they served baked potatoes and they were scrummy.
It was situated in a leafy street and the setting was very romantic.
If you are holidaying in Salou I would highly recommend this restaurant and it was great value for money also.
Bideluze had great food.
"We spoke no spanish/basque, and were able to figure out from the wait staff that the restaurant part was downstairs, like many of the Pintxos bars."
"It had a full menu, and actually had english menus's ( thank goodness!!)"
"As the previous reviewer stated, the salad's are excellent."
My husband had the Bideluze Salad ( had everything in it and was hearty size ).
"I had the BIdeluze Sandwich - grilled with over easy egg, bacon/ham, turkey breast, tomato, with chips/fries."
"We had a side plate of fried potatoes, and it was served with what we thought was ketchup, but tasted tangier, like a pimento sauce."
It was excellent and with 2 soda's it only cost us 25 euro's.
"Unique location but, unfortunately, only open for lunch"
"My wife and I dined here on a visit to Salamanca in mid-May 2008, and picked Rio de La Plata because it is recommended in most of the guide books."
Its a family run business which offers traditional Castllian cooking in a basement restaurant just off the the Plaza Mayor.
"The decor and staff were very nice but we found the food a little bit too rustic for us - it was very plain and lacking in flavour - very much ""from nature to plate"" , which is ok if the base ingredients are flavoursome - but it this case they were not particularly  Maybe we chose the wrong things: Heuvos Flamenco - then - Cabrito Asado Sopa Castellana - then - Cabrito Asado"
"Every time I visit I eat in this restaurant , the staff are the same from year to year which says alot ."
Yhe food is brilliant espically there fried onions ans chicken skewers .. the bill is always vert resonable and I have never been dissapointed .
I dined in this restaurant for the first time last year and myself and my family totally enjoyed our experience in it.
"This restaurant is very much of the beaten track (up a dirt track) but when you finally make it ,wooh it is a hidden gem and you feel like your in ""real spain""."
The food is just fantistic and very reasonably priced for what you get.
"They have spanish dancers which we found great entertainment, especially for the children whom watched their every step for hours!"
When booking make sure you ask for an outdoor table its much better than been stuck indoors after all you are on holidays.Hope this helps.
Enjoy.
We stayed at the Alfonso XIII in March 2008 for four nights.
Our experience with the Alfonso XIII was overall very positive.
"The building, surroundings, and room were all stunningly beautiful."
"Service was very good (e.g., I had my birthday during the stay, and when we came back to the hotel from our afternoon stroll that day we had a complimentary chocolate cake and cava waiting for us!)."
"While dinner at the hotel restaurant was a bit disappointing (fine but nothing special, given the price tag), we found the Japanese restaurant next to the pool of the hotel more recommendable."
"On our last night (Friday night) we had a noise problem with the terrace bar downstairs, where they were playing pretty loud club music until 3 in the night."
"Minor problem, but not what you would expect in a hotel of this standing."
"All in all, we would argue that the only negative thing about the Alfonso XIII are the somewhat outrageous rack rates (and actual rates sometimes paid, judging from the reviews below)."
"Fortunately, that wasn't a problem for us as we managed to obtain a very good package deal via a third party provider."
"At the rack rate, the Alfonso is too pricey, we would argue, but if you manage to get a good deal, go for it!"
"The stunning outlook from this restaurant's open terrace in summer, will make anyones holiday.The excellent food and unpretentious service makes this a favourite venue for a romantic dinner or a special celebration."
Or maybe just a memorable night on your holiday.
"I have recomended it to several people and without fail, everyone loves it."
"Set menus from 50 euros, not including wine."
"However the wine is not too outrageous and its not an ""upselling"" type of place."
I believe it has a michelin award of some kind.The atmosphere is relaxed and the surroundings are quite beautiful.
Treat yourself!
a disapointment.
:(
I spent a few days for work in Madrid a couple of weeks ago.
My hotel recommended the pub and I loved how traditional it looked.
"It has beautiful stained glass, antique wood and friendly and helpful staff that are both Irish and Spanish and speak both languages."
"As well as a great pint of Guinness, it has a good menu."
"I didn't take pictures, but have a look at the internet site."
I will definitely be back if I am in Madrid.
"Very friendly service, nice decoration without the recurrent stereotypes."
Food was excellent.
Very different from the boring tex-mex.
Ate at Es Canyis recently.
( May 08) Meat dishes OK. Desserts excellent.... all homemade.
Probably the best desserts in Port de Soller.
"Anyone who is staying at the Arona Gran end of Los Cristianos and doesn't know about Bella Roma then this is your lucky day.Bella Roma is an Italian restaurant opposite the Hollywood Heights complex 'up the bank'.It's position suggests it will be an exclusive expensive eating house but a look at the menu outside reveals that the prices are the same as the more tacky seaside cafes and restaurants down the hill.You may have to queue for a short while for a table but don't be put off by that as my wife and I nearly were the first time we tried it.After a short while you'll be shown to a table and it becomes obvious you're in a nice place to have a meal.It gets better by the minute,the service is quick ,the waiters are attentive and the menu varied.I am normally a pizza man but decided to try other dishes and found each one excellent.I would particulaly recommend the spaghetti bolognaise,plain and wholesome but very tasty and enjoyable.The total bill as I have said is no greater than more moderate establishments but usually includes a complimentary drink which is a nice touch.You will walk away with a warm glow and I'm sure you'll go back time and time again.Great food,great service and prices that won't bust your holiday budget,what more can you want."
"Great food and ambiance, recomended!"
!
Buried in the depths of the Albaicin the Mirador deMorayma has fantastic views of the Alhambra.
"When you first arrive it may appear that the restaurant is closed, ring the door bell and someone will come and let you in."
"This restaurant has a number of dining rooms, try and make sure you are situated on the ground or first floors rather than downstairs."
"The room we were in only had one other table full, so it lacked a little ambiance compared to the ground floor level but we were there on a Tuesday night."
"The food was good, don't expect perfection but it's good Andalusian food."
Likewise the house wine was good.
The food probably deserves 3.5/5.
"Food was good as expected, but the service very unprofessional and even quite unfriendly."
The tables were so small that we did not even have room to place the plates.
"Honestly, I do not understand why this place is so popular."
"Running now for in access of 31 years, this family run restaurant never changes."
Weather it a quite febuary evening or late afternoon in August the standard is always the same.
Steaks melt in your mouth and service is excellent.
Not to be missed on any visit to Nerja.
"We stayed in Nerja last Summer 2007, We hope to return again in June."
Out of our 11 day stay we ate in Meson Antonio about 6 times.
"The food was fab, & The atmosphere was great."
"Good food, great service, restaurateurs by traditon."
The foreig currency collection is added value for this great experience
This restaurant looks out over the Arenal Beach.
"They serve steaks, fish, chicken ect..."
Try their prawn cocktail for starter and then the shoulder of lamb.
"Food is good, not cheap, but nice surroundings."
"We struggled to find somewhere good to eat in Tossa, but asked Andreas at Don Juan Bar (on the main street in the old town) where to go to eat Zarzuelas, and he recommended this place."
"The portions are HUGE - try the chiponates (I think that's what they were called - baby quid) for starters plus a green salad, and share."
"Then share any of the main meals, they are also huge, and mop up with the tomato or just plain bread."
"We had Zarsuelas, a beautiful fish stew with langoustines, mussels, clams, monk fish, hake, calamari, and a slightly spicier version which was possibly even better."
"They do specialise in fish, but the steaks also looked superb, lovely dark well hung meat, so big I thought they were a roasting joint!"
"it's located down a back street in the old part of town - turn up the streeet next to Don Juan bar, then right, left and left again."
The restaurant is on your right.
Sounds complicated but it's not.
"They also owned another restaurant across the street, la Paella, which we didn't try, but poked our noses in - he had over a hundred different bottles of scotch in stock, so if you love whisky try there."
"The real spanish beef is in this house, these guys know how to handle a bull."
The best of Madrid steakhouses out of many good ones
"Living around the corner (Cadaques),I`m quite often at the Restaurant (Cap De Creus).Apart from being situated at a unique place, I love the food there, the ambience also is great Well, the owner : he´s the cook, no, he´s not into public relations."
"Just let him do his job, and he´s a nice guy."
"The whole thing happening there is certainly too good to accept , that there is only that one (mean) review on your page."
Have a look and make up your own opinion !
Bye
We dined here twice during our April 2008 visit to Seville.
"Both times the servers, - and there were several - were very attentive and had a great attitude."
The service was very professional and accommodating.
The asparagus appetizer and avocado appetizer are each wonderful - try them both.
Both the pork tenderloin and pork on the skewer were delicious.
"Great wine, great food great atmosphere."
Will dine there again.
I´ve driven past this restaurant for years.
"It stands on its own, on the beachside of the long straight road into/out of Cadiz."
You can only get to it be entering and leaving Cadiz.
There´s nothing about this venta from the outside that could prepare you for the inside.
One Saturday we decided to stop there on our way out of Cadiz as we couldn´t get parked close to our favourite El Faro tapas bar.
It turns out that El Ventorrillo and El Faro are sister restaurants!!
We thought this was going to be like any other Venta - it´s not.
We were greeted by valet parking.
Inside was a complete surprise.
"It´was heaving, charming and elegant."
"Ushered to the tiny bar as we didn´t have a reservation, we enjoyed drinks before we were shown to a table downstairs."
We hadn´t even been aware there was a downstairs!
"The menu was fabulous and the wine list fantastic.After a late breakfast, we felt we couldn´t do justice to the menu degustacion so we ordered a roast partridge which my boyfriend described as the best ever and I enjoyed fabulous rice with prawns and asparagus."
It was a treat to be somewhere where it was possible to order arroz for 1 instead of the normal 2 to share.
We ordered a Contino Reserva 2001 which they decanted and we drank it from great big ballons.
Great service and very reasonable for what it is - depending on the wine you order.
We´re definitely going to return for the menu degustacion but the question is - who´s going to drive?
"Within easy taxi reach of Cadiz so if you´re there, this pace is a MUST."
"Historically, it´s also fascinating but don´t ask me exactly why - I wasn´t driving!"
!
We visit the restaurant for dinner.
The meal was plenty and tasteful.
My husband ate lamb chops and I had madallions of pork fillet with a delicious sauce including currants.
The price was 15€ p.P.
A good bottle of red wine complete the meal.
The waiter was friendly and attentiv.
We recommend this restaurant.
"The manager of our hotel recommended this place, and was he ever right."
We went twice during our 5 days in Madrid and were very pleased both times.
"The place looks very expensive and is beautifully decorated, but the prices are reasonable and the food is imaginative and excellent."
"The servers are friendly, but varied in experience and quality."
"The kichen is obviously well run, as the dishes are prepared fast but with great care."
I would wholeheartedly recommend Ginger to anyone visiting Madrid.
"Ambiente oscuro y sitio destartalado, pero hacen una de las mejores cocinas tradicionales chinas."
"The place looks a bit old and stuffy, but the food was good."
Fantastic views.
We had heard of the reputation of this restaurant in the UK so much so that we phoned from the UK to make a reservation.
We arrived to what looked to be a very special place with a superb ambience.
They however could not find our reservation but they did fit us in immediately and we were offered a nice table.
As this was our friend's wedding anniversary we had expected a special evening without too much concern about the price and duly ordered.
"I can only describe the food that we received as sparse, lacking any vegetables of note served by a waiter who was so busy that he literally threw the food down on to the table."
I ordered roast suckling pork.
This was greasy in the extreme and had little to commend it.
It was served with a grilled tomato and 'french fries' that had been cooked at least twice.
My wife had fish which looked totally unappetising and proved to be so.
"We were charged 160 euros for this for the 4 of us, which did include a bottle of wine but it was an absolute rip off."
I would strongly recommend to anybody not to bother with this place.
It is a totally unforgettable experience all for the wrong reasons.
If I had been served this in the UK I would have refused to pay but we were thwarted by the language barrier.
Best place to go for a typical Spanish meal.
"Lovely tapas for starters and delicious paella (""peeled"", i.e."
"no shells"") Reasonably priced and very good service."
We were attracted by the setting so we stopped in for a beer and they served us a plate of the best green olives we have ever had.
The building is beautiful and a few 100 years old.
The waiter was very nice and provided us with the history of both the building and the olives!
Went there with my family for dinner and had a great evening.
"The service provided was exellent, and the food an experience we could only dream of."
"Prices are not cheap, however it is woth every penny, and a lot more."
The value you get on one of the fixed menus is fantastic.
Only problem is: When can we get back!
"Located just south of the Casino, up the steps, next to the neighboring El Pescador, Es Baluard offers fresh grilled and fried seafood in a bright airy white washed interior which is always humming with activity."
You can check out their menu (in several languages) at their website.
"The merluza, mixed grilled fish and suquet are all very good."
Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and desert runs about 80 Euros.
The fresh cheese (cottage) ice cream with marmalade is super.
"The website is www.esbaluard-cadaques.net/who.html The always crowded El Pescador next door is likewise good, a little more casual and offers outdoor seating under the canopy right on the street overlooking the bay."
I stumbled across this tiny store in Barcelona.
I bought three sampler boxes and the floral/herb one was just outstanding.
"The ""gastronomic innovations"" set was interesting but perhaps my palate just isn't innovative enough for anchovy with chocolate..."
"The rose, violet and lavender flavors in particular were just heavenly."
The chocolate itself is wonderful too.
I wish they sold online - I'd buy more of the floral ones for sure.
They were pricey but not out of line with gourmet chocolate places elsewhere.
This is more of a warning than a review.
"Although we had wonderful experiences in dozens of different tapas bars all over Madrid, one place to avoid (in the Palace Hotel, Prado area) is called Cerveceria Cervantes."
"We ordered one order of shrimp, the waitress brought two, refused to remove the extra one and then grossly overcharged us."
"Additionally, my credit card company says that they had no right to convert the Euros into US$ and add a 2% extra charge."
No other bar or restaurant did any such thing.
"This used to be a nice place for shell-fish tapas, but now they are apparently getting greedy and looking to take advantage of jet-lagged tourists."
"The restaurant's main dish, the trout, is absolutely yummy."
"Also not to miss is the ""Adobo"", small cubes of fried fish that seem to just melt in your mouth."
Tip: Avoid the hard ring of bread they put on your table and avoid paying bread trap of 1.50 per person.
We had a marvellous eating experience at this restaurant.
The food was superb and we let our waiter Antonio choose our Tapas for us !
We were complete novices at ordering Tapas - he just bought us what he thought we would like and told us to say stop when we had had enough - just brilliant.
The restaurant was recommended by our Hotel as the best Tapas in Barcelona and we couldn't agree more.
We arrived at 8pm and only had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for a table even though the place was really busy.
Cannot fault it at all for quality for food and service would definetly go back and eat here again.
"Excellent food, lovely fresh tapas and good service."
Cant wait to go there again.
We only ended up at Casa Rodrigo's because we were late for lunch and everywhere else we'd tried to eat had closed their kitchens [about 5 p.m. in Madrid].
We asked if they would serve us and their delightful waiter said yes.
Then he proceeded to fawn over us.
The soup was absolutely fabulous [Garbanzos con callos] and the ragu de ternera [veal stew] I swear was as good as my mother's.
"The meat was tender, juicy, not too salty, but so flavorful."
The potatoes wer fresh and crispy-- I normally do not eat potatoes [starch calories] but I ate all of these.
"Many Madrid restaurant claim to have ""comida casera"" [homecooked food] but this one delivers."
For 8 Euros!!!
"We got bread, drink [my husband had a half bottle of wine], soup, main dish, and desert."
"Plus they gave us a ""chopito"" [an after dinner cordial]."
I so recommend this place in the hip neighborhood of Malasaña.
It's cheap and wonderful!
I am going back once a week until I sadly have to return home...
This has got to be the worst restaurant I have been to in Europe.
The only reason the whole eevening was not a disaster is the fun we had laughing at the food we were servred.
Did not enjoy our meal in this restaurant.
Dreadful steak and mediocre paella.
Staff not helpful just wanted to serve and get you out - NOT a relaxing evening after a busy day sightseeing.
Would not recommend it to anyone.
Great for groups
"Nice staff, especially the Irish young lad."
"Kids menu a success, with Simpsons ice-cream to finish."
Lovely view over Marina.
"Good burgers, chips middle of road."
Just had a meal last night and was very impressed.
I had huge block of smoked salmon mixed with raw tuna to start with.
Very good presentation!
"Followed by Catalonia style foie gras, also delicious."
Topped off with a beautifully presented Creme Catalonia.
Wine list was good and waitress very able to recommend wines.
"Total for 2 was 100 Euros, seemed very reasonable for the quality of food and general ambience."
Stayed in a local apartment near this restaurant.
They charge 1.75 euros per person for inedible bread that is dumped onto your table whether you want it or not.
This was just the beginning of our worst meal we had in Barcelona.
My husband and I ate dinner there on Sunday 18th May 2008.
It was a lovely warm evening and we got a table on the terrace overlooking the bay.
The views are fantastic and as it gets dark they light loads of candles and lanterns.
"There was a really nice atmosphere, good wine glasses, and inobtrusive service."
"They humoured me when I 'd popped in earlier in the evening and made my booking in Spanish, but they all spoke excellent English and German too."
"The cocktails looked great, and my husband's gin and tonic was enormous."
"We had a nice bottle of Mallorcan white, but, peculiarly German mineral water."
"Now I know I cannot claim to be an environmental warrier having flown to Mallorca on holiday, but there are some really good local waters so it does seem a bit unnecessary!"
"The food was good, we shared the filo-wrapped prawns to start (five big prawns, chilli sauce and fantastic garlic mayonnaise to dip in)."
For main course I had scallops and king prawns in lobster sauce with roasted fennel.
The food was really tasty and the portion size generous.
"The presentation was a bit busy for my liking- on a massive plate my shellfish and sauce was shared between three big shells, interspersed with a big timbale of rice, half a lemon, tons of fennel (v yummy!)"
etc.
"But it's really a small criticism, the food was good."
My husband had a variety of fish fillets with rosemary potatoes- again really good food in large amounts!
We finished with coffee (served with Werther's original and Starbursts!)
It was reasonably expensive (about 100 euros in total) but worth it I think for the quality of food and great location.
We ate at this restaurant in June 2007.
Unfortunately it was not possible to write a review for Trip Adviser as they did not have a Restaurant section at that time.
"Although a little difficult to find, it is well worth the effort of finding this restaurant."
"The food was absolutely fabulous, the service faultless and very professional and the restaurant itself was elegant and sophisticated."
Mean is a lovely restaurant in old town Marbella (orange square).
The staff were excellent and the food was also great - especially grilled fish (swordfish and dorada).
"Ask for a table in the middle of the square, you are surrounded by orange trees and you would have no idea that you were in the middle of the Costa Del Sol!"
the best restaurant in Madrid
Corral de la Moreria is a dinner and Flamenco dance club which has been open more than 50 years.
"We ate dinner there from 9-10PM, and then watched the show from 10PM to about midnight."
Desert and after dinner drinks were served during breaks.
The food was good.
There are 4 menus to choose from.
"They range from 72 euros to 130 euros with a show, depending on what food you order."
The show was incredible.
They have their own guitar players and singers.
First there are 4 dancers in a show.
Then there are the featured dancers.
I don't know how to describe it except to say it was mesmerizing.
It seemed only a short time before the 2 hours was up.
A couple of observations - the dance stage is very small and it took a great deal of skill to do what these dancers did in that space.
"Second, the guitar players and singers have making themselves NOT be noticed to an art."
Don't leave Madrid without seeing Flamenco.
"If you want to go to the very best, go to Corral de la Moreria."
We just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona & southern France.
We had our best meal of all at Alba Granados in L'eixample area of Barcelona.
"The food is exceptional, with lovely flavour combinations."
"Nearly everything comes in half portions, so you can really try many things."
"The rucola salad was phenomenal, as was the avocado salad."
"We also had the tuna, which was delicious, and the steak - exceptional."
Such an exquisite sauce we were in heaven.
We ended the meal with the Creme Catalan - a subtly spiced creme brulee - and some dessert wines.
"All in all, fantastic."
"We are not huge eaters quantity-wise, but we are foodies."
"We really liked the half-order option, and including a bottle of cava, three appetizers, two half order entrees, dessert, and dessert wine we spent €107."
We were there for about 2 hours +.
"Very relaxed, unlike the tourist traps near La Rambla that try to get you in & out quick."
No restaurant gets 3 stars from Michellin for nothing.
Everything must be magnificent.
My wife and I went to Lasarte and loved the degustation menu.
"Great see food dishes, prepared with great presentation and taste."
The ambient was nice and the staff attended us well.
"Less than 300 euros for both with two degustation menus, cavas for start, a bottle watter, one of white wine and two glasses of red."
If this was in France would cost at least 2 times more.
I highly recommend for special moments.
Had the set lunch - it was really good and excellent value.
Went back the next day for Birthday dinner - queued for almost an hour - tried the Paella and it was dire.
Don't have the paella .....
"This was recommended to us before we went, so thought we'd give it a go."
I'm glad we did!
With so many overpriced restaurants nearby this is quite a find.
"Great food, and nice wine (good house Cava), with great value for money too."
We went twice as we enjoyed it that much!
Get there early to avoid the queues.
"Like so many others, we saw long lines of people waiting at Les Quinze Nits."
"The awnings are stylish, the tables and chairs are stylish, the menu appears good and is super cheap compared to many others in Barcelona."
"And, it's in a great Placa to boot!"
"However, we found that the food was completely generic."
A simple salad you could make at home.
"Fish & chicken, again I could whip them up on any weeknight or order them at the cafe at work."
The desserts were an absolute insult.
Literally inedible.
I could imagine being served these desserts in a mediocre university dining hall.
"All in all, we were out of there for €46 for a pitcher of sangria, two salads, two entrees, two desserts and a bottle of water."
"Yes, it is truly the cheapest three-course sit down meal in Barcelona, but we agreed we'd have preferred a locals joint/bar type place which would have had more flavor, ambiance, and would not have literally chased us out of our seats when it was time to close."
So anti-Spanish.
"My mother-in-law and i went to Nerja, Malaga in February.We had a lovely time."
We both wanted to find a authentic Spanish tapas bar.Considering the amount of Irish bars around we was very lucky to find this little bar called Vinoleto.
There's a large selection of wines.The tapas are absolutely gorgeous.The owners Carmen & Irena were perfect hostesses.The prices were cheap.
It really made our holiday.Would definitely recommend you go
"Our friends visited this place 2 years ago, during Spanish trip and they were absolutely creasy about ""Jose Maria"" and its ""conchinillos""."
"So, when we were in Segovia , it was quite clear for us -where to try this special dish."
"Right after awakening at ""Infanta Isabel"" and a cup of coffee on Plaza Mayor, we went to ""Jose Maria"" to book a dinner."
At 11.30 a.m. it was only one table for 2 for 8.30 p.m. !
And huge waiting list for early hours.
But our patience was granted.We had a wonderful dinner.
"Their ""conchinillo"" was delicious and this is really a reason for us to return to Segovia again and again!"
best japanese food on the isle..
"A nice place and the food is not bad,the trouble is there`s not much of it!"
"My main course was veal kebab, what arrived was a kebab of half veal and half sausage and some potato crisps,no sign of any veg.To be fair the starter was ok, but I can`t really recommend the place"
We have just returned from a week in Palma in Majorca.
We were staying in an apartment in the centre of the old town and decided it would be great not to cook.
We tried many of the restaurants in the area which we found to range from awful to good.
The Mammamia was the find of the holiday.
Although it is tucked away in a side street it is worth the effort of finding it.
"The food is of Italian origin, freshly cooked, with local fish ,meats and vegetables by the chef owner who really has a passion for food."
The prices of the food are acceptable as is the price wine.
Fantastic - what more can I say!
"I'd eaten a pizza in my hotel,which was terrible.The cheese on top was all runny and looked horrible,it wasnt mozzerella which is what id expect it to be.The look of it made me feel quite sick!Being a vegetarian i find it quite difficult when eating out and pizza is one of the only things i can eat."
"On my last day,i found Little Italy on the Pine Walk with views out to sea."
"For starters we had Bruschetta for one, which was plenty for two people.I had a Margherita pizza and my Mother had the Special which was giant king prawns in a tomatoe and garlic sauce with fresh homemade tagliatelle."
My pizza was excellant and Mothers was superb.For pud we shared a tiramisu which was delicious.
"We stayed there quite a few hours,the atmosphere was great,great views out to sea and the staff were very polite,friendly,helpful and fun."
I do love my pizza and thats why i went on about the horrible one id had at the other place.Also some of the Spanish waiters claimed that it was mozzerella chesse but it wasnt it was a Spanish type of cheese and i dont think they should really say its mozzerella or Parmesan when its not.
"Do love the Spanish food too,i had a good Spanish vegetable meal(not Tumbet) at another resturant.One last thing,two of the waiters at Little Italy were very courteous and absolutley gorgeous!!!!"
Bonjour to them.
I would recommend this resturant highly.
My title says it all.
You truly cannot go wrong.
"If you are looking for 5 star or ""English"", ""American"", etc."
"type food or service, this is not the place."
Don't get me wrong.
"As far as I'm concerned, this place is better than most restaurants I have been to that are ""named"" after top chefs."
"It is perfect because the food (Typical spanish) and service are excellent, and you get a true feel of what it is like to be in Spain."
"I travel to enjoy and explore other cultures, so this restaurant rocks!"
"If that is not your thing, your loss."
But I still think you will enjoy this place.
Great views.
Food is ok but is quite expensive.
Not mentioned in any of the guide books we reviewed and was therefore not on our short- list when we arrived for a two night stay in Trujillo in mid-May 2008.
Bizcocho is in the main square just a few doors away from the two restaurants which appear in all the guide books.
We considered them but preferred the decor and menu of the Bizcocho.
I now know we made the right choise.
We opted for 2 x Menu Degustacion at 48 Euro/head with a bottle of quality wine included.
My wife and I are 'foodies' ( the following day we had lunch at the 2**Michelin in Caceres - Atrio) and have to say Bizcocho delivered an outstanding meal both in quality and quantity; indeed we could not finish the sweet selection that was served - just too much.
The sweets were rounded off by coffee and two types of local liqueur (help yourself from two small decanters placed on the table).
We had some excellent meals during our week in Extremedura and Castile & Leon but this one stood out as the best in terms of value for money and quality.
I am a vegetarian and find it quite difficult when eating out at home and abroad but we found this very nice resturant which we went to twice.
They served a tasty vegetable dish(not Tumbet) which was delicious.It wasnt at all boring the sauce with the vegetables was great and lots of different fresh veg.
Great for vegetarians and meat eaters.I would highly recommend.
"The atmosphere was nice and the staff very helpful,friendly and polite."
dont go if your in a hurry... fantastik tapas!
"Forget who you may see there, if anyone of note, be more worried of how they will serve you."
"Hurried, course after course thrown at you."
"We even witnessed a man having to rescue the mussels from the serving dish with his fingerws, as the waiter had decided to take them away, as in his other hand was the next dish, which had also been served too early."
Also watch when ordering water.
Small bottle served but 1 litre charged for.
Really excellent.
The food strikes a perfect balance between the traditional and the innovative.
I would love to go there again
We had a bad start.
We had reserveded a table but when we got there there was no table and the waiters were busy doing anything but trying to help.
"After a while they ""found"" one but it was of cause not the table outside we had reserveded."
the food was ok but if you what service and not a railwaystation do not go there.
this restaurant which has a reputation as one of the finest restaurants in Cordoba and Spain was the biggest disappointment on a fabulous 3 days in Cordoba.
"the service was appalling had to wait to be greeted had to ask for menu had to ask for water, we were served by know less than 5 waiters each one not knowing what the other was doing, the arrogance of most of the waiters was appalling, the restaurant boasts the finest wine cellar that you can imagine we asked for a Grande Reserve Protus which is a fairly common wine and a good one, was told didn't have it they have a cellar of over 900 wines finally food came and believe or not COLD, sent back no apology looked at me as if it was my fault,payed bill couldn't wait to leave, this restaurant is living on past reputation, please don't waste your money there are fabulous restaurants in Cordoba but steer clear of this one."
"If you do want to go to a very special restaurant in Cordoba you wont find better than BODEGAS CAMPAS every thing that a restaurant should be, excellent"
Full English Breakfast with a difference - Chips!!
- staff lovely and good value for money (the food not the staff) May 2008
Oh dear.
"A liquid squid starter (yes - really); half cooked, tiny, slimey prawns (all 4 of them); perfunctory service; and no water supply to the toilets (which I pointed out to the staff, who put it right with a shrug and the comment ""Someone turned it off""."
And the apology was where in that statement?).
We had the 10 course taster menu.
About half of it was appropriately cooked and / or edible.
Not sufficient to warrant a £200 bill for two people with one bottle of £30 wine and two bottles of water.
"Of course the outrageous £5 cover charge slips by almost unnoticed in that kind of bill, but this restaurant clearly trades on its reputation."
It serves up nasty food to people who may believe it is 'creative' or 'original'.
It is neither - just odd and unpleasant.
The chef seems to throw disparate ingredients together at random.
"In my view, that's foolish rather than inspired."
"Great food, good atmosphere, very authentic."
"Paella, Fish and Lamb are all above average."
Good wine list.
An experience for any seafood lover.
"No menu, just sit an see what comes your way - so exciting!"
"Amazing food, 10 courses (9 small, one main) of top quality seafood - amongst ours we had clams in a light white wine sauce, razor clams in garlic, sea snails, lots of prawns, langoustines, tiny fried whitebaitand our main was the most beautiful piece of hake i've ever tasted."
"Washed down with great cava and helped along by very friendly service, I couldn't fault it( athough a few less ""expense account"" tables would have been better)."
"An amazing experience, but not cheap -our bill was +E100 per person."
Worth every penny!
Busy busy busy .. favourite with locals as well as tourists so get there early to avoid queues.
Quality of food is great and reasonably priced - house wine not bad either.
A fun place to eat and people watch!
"seaview, great seafood and good wine...what else to say...maybe don""t forget the reservation before u go there.."
We happened on La Fragua de Vulcano while in Madrid a few weeks ago.
"It was a happy, bustling place, filled with locals as well as tourists."
"We had great paella (a large dish had just been brought out to the bar), and great Gambas a la Plancha."
"Very inexpensive for what we got (16 to 20 euros, I think), including large salads and canas (draft beers)."
Wait staff was friendly.
Recommend it highly.
H\ave been visiting this retaurant for 30 years and the owner Alphonso still doesn't look any older!
Good quality food with the usual tourist menu.
"What I likeabout this is that it's just a little way off Calle San Miguel, so has a more relaxed atmosphere in my opinion."
Very happy to while away the time drinking Sangria or the odd beer here!
"Haven't visited during the evening, but a guess would imagine gets busy."
Would recommend without hesitation.
"We came to this restaurant on the first night of our holiday, and returned once again during our stay."
"It has good fish choices, good wine list, and definately seems very Spanish!"
It has a lovely view out to the sea (incidently there was an awesome storm out to sea on our first night-very atmospheric!)
though to be fair most of the restaurants along the front do!
"The staff were friendly, and helped me when trying to speak a little Spanish which was nice."
"The food was good, not incredible, but good."
Definately worth a visit I'd say!
We arrived at Bar Mut at 11:30am or so - having slept in after a late night out in BCN.
"They looked at us like we were nuts when we asked if we could eat (lunch is 1:30 at the earliest), but they realised we wanted breakfast and they agreed to it - we ordered fried eggs, fried potatoes (in this case, actually french fries - so yummy!"
"), pan con tomate, jamon and several coffees."
The food was great and the atmosphere excellent at that time of day - Friday in May.
"I imagine it's completely overwhelmed with fans during the busier summer months and during busier times of day, but we will remember Bar Mut as one of our favourite Barcelona experiences."
(Better than Pinoxto!)
We had a good meal consisting of local dishes.
There was one problem though.
"My plate of Jamon Iberico de Belota (JIdB) contained Jamon alright, but not JIdB."
"I can tell JIdB on a blind tasting, and it was not that but some cheaper version of jamon - could have been jamon serrano or something similar."
When the bill came it said JIdB.
So there was no possibility of an error.
They didn't even bother to enquire why the plate was left unconsumed.
"I wonder what motivated them, perhaps they thought that a gringo wouldn't be able to tell the difference?"
"I would still recommend the restaurant, only stay away from the Jamon."
My partner and I spent a week in Alcudia and visted this restaurant on our second night.
"The menu consists of home made Italian pastas, pizzas and deserts made with first class fresh ingredients."
The quality of the food was excellent and we returned for a further four nights to savour the atmosphere.
A bottle of good house wine costs €8.50.
Total cost 3 course meal for 2 including wine was €50 -€55.
The staff were absolutely charming and friendly.
"They have a great selection of music DVD's which they will put on, if requested ,at a volume that is acceptable to other patrons."
Have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant and would definitely go back again
I read a review about this restaurant from Expedia recommending it.
PLEASE NOTE: if you are an non-smoker smoking is allowed in this establishment.
Always check the smoking sign outside each restaurant to see whether it is permitted.
"View was lovely, that's where the postive recommendation ends."
Having asked the waiter what he recommended he suggested the Tomato/Mozarella salad and the pan-fried Sole.
My husband had the mixed grill.
Entree was okay.
Our main course turned up as 2 mixed grills which he brought to the table adjacent to us.
When he realised his mistake he then brought them both to our table assuming that we would take them!
"Of course we refused, especially as our ""neighbour"" had ben prodding the food for a few minutes."
We waited another half an hour for the correct order.
"Again the food was average, very dodgey looking French beans with little taste."
"We were hoping to get a reduction of a main course from the bill, but when this was put to the manager he offered us coffee!"
We should have pushed this a bit more but by this time I just wanted to leave.
No tip was left!
A simple mistake which was rectified?
"Maybe, but they could have showed some goodwill in granting our request rather than a cheap cup of coffee (which we don't drink!!!)"
Needless to say I would not recommend this restaurant.
This is a restaurant I will definitely go back to.
We had an extremely good tapas lunch in the bar area where we were made to feel like honoured guests.
The tapas were cooked to perfection.
"There was also a very good wine list and after a lengthy discussion as to which wine to choose, we tried the recommended white."
"Whilst we were there we took the opportunity of looking at the restaurant, which was very elegant and attractive."
There was a harpist playing very soothing background music.
The menu also looked very interesting and appealing.
The staff were very friendly and professional.
A real find.
"This waterfront restaurant is apparently known for Paella, and we had - well, you guessed it: seafood paella which was extraordinary."
The seafood was fresh and had a great salty taste.
"The place is not fancy, but the service was quite good."
Pleasant and attentive.
"Not cheap by any means, but we would definitely return."
"My husband and I have been fortunate to have traveled quite a bit, and have enjoyed some of the most wonderful restaurants all across Europe, and the restaurant at the Hotel Amanhavis, in Benahavis Spain, is among one of the best we have experienced."
"The small boutique hotel is located at the end of the main street in this small, hill town."
"There is a parking garage just before the end of the main street, but we were able to park beyond the hotel on the street, a very safe area."
"The hotel restaurant is small and intimate, and reservations are highly recommended."
I understand that in the summer a few tables are set up on the private patio surrounding the pool as well.
"Everything about the restaurant was wonderful, with amazing personal service, and the owner and his staff who all seem to take great pride in their establishment and in having happy clients."
The menu was different from any we saw during our 12 days in Spain.
"Based on Andalucian style, they take the cuisine many steps up in style."
"They use many local ingredients, all based on what is fresh and of the best quality."
"There are price-fix menu options of 2, 3 or 4 course, and a few items marked as extra."
"Not being a professional reviewer, I thought giving some examples from the menu might be the best way to describe our experience."
The night we dined at Amanhavis some of the main dishes included: Rolled Medallions of Veal filled with Serrano ham and manghego cheese on a truffle sauce;  Fillet of seabream with almond-pesto on a light saffron sauce;  and Ragout of young Mountain Goat from the fields of Benahavis and tarragon sauce.
One of the soups that night was Light Spinach-garlic soup with herbed mousse… and both of us cannot remember having a better soup anywhere.
"There were 7 starters, 5 main courses and 4 desserts to choose from on the price-fix menu as well as a one or two extra priced options in each category."
"The food was just delightful, and the price we thought very well worth it."
We would easily have paid double the price in many other places.
"If you are in the area, we highly recommend a stop in Benahavis and the Hotel Amanhavis restaurant."
"Situated just off the beach, with good views."
Waiter was patient and attentive.
"Had good suggestions, We wanted to try the local cuisine."
We had a Xato de Stiges - which is a local speciality - a salad of seafood.
Also had Musclos a la Marinera - which was mussels cooked in a tomato salsa and a paella marinera.
"Very pleasant experience, good service, would recommend it for anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price."
great for a Sushi 101 experience!!!
Pretty Cheap too
Good place for grabbing something light like a beer with a hamburger or a hot dog.
Wonderful location.
Excellent pasta!
Apart from what you ask they give you a taste of every other pasta course that the other members of the table have ordered.
Classic atmosphere
A VERY special place.
"If you order pasta, you can taste a small portion of your friends' order."
Desserts are just fabolous so don't miss them!
Not authentic Thai food.
Cheap little tabern.
It is awfully crowded but for the taste and price it is worth it.
"My favorite for a Lomo sandwich, simply the best."
Mint.
I love going to this place - the mood is informal and the Galician seafood served sit-down-tapas style is excellent.
"Recommendations are to get a bottle of Albariño, the Pulpo and the Arroz a la Marinera (lunchtime only)."
"Only downside might be the loud Galician bagpipe music, but it is well masked by a room full of Spaniards at full voice (that is, Spaniards speaking in a meaningful way)."
Very good value for your money.
Tipical Canarian food
Really good price-quality-quantity relationship.
Original atmosphere.
Take the menu degustación.
Really good value
Second best burgers inthe city.

Excellent place to be delighted by the sun and the sea in winter.

Good japanese food at reasonable price.
Relaxed and informal atmosphere
"Fresh fish, and good service"
One of my favorites when I am In Madrid
Solomillo al wok!!!
!
One of the worst places to have Chinese food.
The best restaurant in Barcelona if you want to experience modern catalan cusine.
El menú sorpresa is extraordinary (although expensive)
"Far away from the center and difficult to park the car but a good choice if you are in the neighbourhood : great italo-argentinian food, excellent !"
very nice..in fact there are no turists..!!
!
very good tapas..... start to be touristic
"Very good tapas, but have to wait a long time, especially if you go on the weekend"
Pais Vacso restaurant very good one
Expensive and with nothing interesting to offer
"nice, easy and comfortable."
Good mediterranean food
"The ugliest,oldest, dirtiest bar in Madrid."
About to be demolished.
Charming.
2 star Michelin and really classy but you will need to empty your bank account to go or be handed a gift invitation from a wealthy benefactor.
"The service is excellent - each member of the staff has a dedicated role (sommelier, chees-elier, lacuenta-elier etc)."
The best in town for TAPEO.
"Wonderful Tapas, pay really what you eat."
Solomillo and pimientos del padròn.
"Beer for me, please."
Indian food.
Old fashioned.
the best restaurant of Peruvian food
"Too expensive... Nice food, but not exciting interior design"
Good food (probably not the best mexican you have tasted) but also good price and friendly atmosphere.
Noisy.
Best burgers in the city.
The place to be on sundays!
to taste a good wine.
Great stuff - although better for lunchtime or an early dinner - personal favourite Soba noodles with tofu
Really interesting interior design.
Posh atmosphere.
"Nice food (modern cuisine, small courses)."
Great desserts and excellent wines.
Really expensive!
"Too much, price-quality relationship Tram Tram is really superior."
"All in all, a good option for a night, but due to price I won't go again."
Great!
One of the best steaks i've ever eaten...
A place that is hard to fault from quality of food to service and value for money.
Book early as this little place never sleeps with customers queuing out of the door from 7-12pm.
Delicious fresh pasta and pizza overlooking the beach and pine walks.
The kids play in safety while you finish your wine!
Superb!
Traditional catalan cuisine in an old building in the middle of the Born.
Good price-relationship and food is ok.
Very authentic Mallorcan food in a nice open-air setting.
Most of the food is grown on their own farm and all recipies are traditional Mallorcan.
Service is a bit slow but the place is highly recommendable!
Excellent patatas bravas.
Must if yu are in Barcelona.
Cheap and without any pretension.
Just incredible patatas bravas.

Meat eaters unite !

"The atmosphere is brilliant, staff are friendly, great winelist, and the food (ordered to share) is modern spanish and delicious."
Recommendation: patatas con cinco quesos.
"A great location, simple menu and delicious food."
Try the deep fried baby squid
"great food: try the salmorejo, you'll love it!"
Expensive and there are many other better places to eat good sea food at Barcelona!
Probably one of the best pintxos in San Sebastian.
"Try ""migas"" in weekends."
Must taste!
Good wine selection!
"great restaurant, speciality snails, typical from Lleida."
Perfect for TAPEO
"It's ok but quality should be better, in my opinion..."
Ambient and the spanish film memorabilia on the walls was interesting.
"The food was good but not great, and the chef who made a initially good first impression by explaining the menu to us in person, started to become annoying by his continued hovering presence in the dining rooms (bit of an egoista)..."
chocalate y churros
Pretty BA argentinian food
a very good paella on the beach
Good price-quality relationship.
Food based on catalan cusine.
Really crowded and noisy.
Good place just for a cheap group dinner.
"Definitely try the Lacón con cachelos, Pulpo al gallego (always a safe bet ) or Sepia con patatas - the chips underneath are even better than the Cuttlefish"
Friendly restaurant in the heart of town - at the end of Parellades.
"Good selection of typically Catalan food, and some excellent fish dishes."
"Still very much family-owned, so everyone takes a real pride in the place."
Excellent value for money - especially at lunchtime (though you'll need a long siesta afterwards!
).
Queuing up for an 8:30 pm start just doesn't seem as if it was worth it now.
"Although the food was nice (even if my lamb was swimming in sauce) and reasonably priced, the service left a lot to be desired."
It didn't compliment or fit the white table cloth ambiance at all.
Not to mention the fact that our table cloth was stained even though we were first in for the dinner service.
Here are a few of our gripes: The waiters looked as though they would rather be anywhere else leaning on waiter stations etc.
"When we ordered 2 cokes, we were brought just bottles, no glasses and no ice."
"The attitude when we asked for some ice was just as displeasing, let alone the fact that we had to fish the ice out of the bowl with our fingers!"
Our beers were also just delievered in the bottles.
"There was salt on the table but no pepper, the service and meals were inconsistent, tourists v locals, being that locals recieved better service and better presented meals."
"Our side salad was brought out as a starter, now granted we didn't specify that we wanted it all together, but as a basis of customer service, the waiter could have asked."
"Basically, although the food was nice, I wouldn't recommend it simply for the bad service."
I was impressed the first time I dined there five years ago.
"It is a nice space with good food and great prices, but it seems to have lost its touch this last visit."
"The staff was horribly rude and inattentive even by European standards, and the crowd certainly didn't fit in with the white tablecloth setting, as evidenced by large backpacks on the floor."
Better to get off the main drag and visit somewhere more authentic.
My boyfriend and have just returned from ten days in Spain; we spent one night in the little town of Calatayud.
"The town itself is beautiful, but the high point was definitely dinner at Casa Escartin."
"He had the lamb, which he says was the best he's ever had."
I had chicken that simply fell off the bone.
Yum!
"The wine list was extensive, and our selection was perfect."
"The restaurant's decor is simple and rustic, and the service was wonderful."
"If we ever return to Calatayud, we will definitely stop off at Casa Escartin for dinner."
Buen provecho!
I was looking forward to my stay at the AlfonsoXIII and on the whole I was not disappointed.
The hotel is well located in the centre of the city and within a few hundred yards of the main attractions.
The building itself is lovely and the central courtyard is a great place to sit and take in the atmosphere.
The bedrooms were spacious with ornate decoration and extremely comfortable beds.
The restaurant serves very good food although it was a little pricey.
The wine recommendation was spot on and not particularly expensive.
Staff remembered our name and what we liked to drink.
"Breakfast, however was disappointing, it was the usual buffet some of which looked a little tired."
The fresh pealed and sliced fruit was put out fresh on the first day we arrived and was looking very sad when half of it was still there on the third day.
Our main criticism is that this is also a popular place with the locals to hold wedding receptions.
On the Friday and Saturday of our stay there were a number of wedding receptions taking place.
On one afternoon the central courtyard was not open due to a wedding.
The music played at these events was extremely loud and could be heard in our room as if were in the midst of the celebrations.
The wedding noise also dominated dinner in the restraint on Saturday the only consolation was that on the whole the music was very good!.
Went here on my last day in BCN based on other Trip Advisor reviews and proximity to my apartment.
Wow!
"I did the ""short"" testing menu for lunch and had a lot of fun with the waiters paring up courses with Catalan and Spanish wines."
Every course was fantastic but the veal cheek was an experience that I'll never forget.
"It was so rich and tender, I didn't want to finish it - the experience was that good."
Kudos to the wait staff on knowing how to treat a solo diner - I never felt remotely rushed in the 2+ hours I was there.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine dining with a twist on local dishes made with in-season ingredients.
A great place to go once if you want something different than just tapas.
Minimalist space with delicious food and a very professional team.
One of my favorites!
"Le Bistrot in mojacar is well worth a visit if you are on holiday in the area.My wife and I have just spent a very pleasent week in Mojacar and went out each evening for dinner.On the whole we found most of the restraunts of a good standard but our favourite was Le Bistrot.Mainly French influenced cuisine all courses we simple and delicious and excellent value,3 courses and drinks at under 55 euro.Apart from great food and great value there was a very pleasent relaxed ambience to the whole dining experience."
The food was wonderful.
We ate there twice!
!
"When we were struggling with the Spanish-only menu, an off-duty employee of the restaurant started translating for us, then the chef came out."
The food was good.
"The dessert was especially good, and the staff was incredibly helpful."
"It's a chic environment that must really get hopping late nate, as there were reserved ""bed"" areas for the club-time later."
I have eaten here 4 times and in the last year has recieved a mitchilin star and I must say it truely deserves it.
It has great wines which are stacked from the floor to ceiling (they use a ladder to get to the top ones) and a fantastic menu.
They now do the menu in English and they also speak a little english.
"A very nice place for a special Birthday, the food is excellent and service is next to none well worth a vist"
"This restaurant serves a wide choice of excellent meals, the service is superb, and the kitchen is within view, and spotless."
"The waiter heated our toddlers bottle, and when we ordered an ice cream for her, they took her to the display to choose her own dish, which was served in a character bowl (which we could keep) and had a sparkler in it."
"The price is very reasonable, and there is entertainment in the square, and lots going on around."
They were also one of the few restaurants who did not add a service charge for eating there on New Years Eve.
"We would definitely reccomend this restaurant to anyone, and we will be eating there again this December."
Finally a real Thai restaurant in Barcelona.
"Excellent food in a great setting, remembers me my best restaurants in Bangkok."
Not spicy enough but still hot in europe.
Expensive ?
off course but it will cost you less than a Thai Airways ticket !
Very simple restaurant located in the midle of a forest very near the beach.
Excellent place for kids and you will find the best meat than you can imagine
"On our last night we were reccomended this restaurant by a couple of regular visitors to this resort, and i have to say it was absolutely brilliant."
every table had a hotplate and extractor fan and the chef cooked your meal at your table.
"staff were good, lovely friendly atmosphere."
"Moreover, the meal was first class, i would highly recomend this restaurant."
"it was a japanence restaurant., but they had a wide selection of menu's to choose from."
i cann;t recommend this restaurant.
"enough, please give it a vist"
We loved this place ... it's got just enough old school polish (tuxedo'd waiters running about) and excellent food (10+ pages of seafood) to keep anybody happy.
"It's not cheap (the two of us left there tonight 200 Euros poorer), but it's an experience and the staff was great."
Pros: Huge portions!
"The service was as good as the seafood, and the whole evening a bit of an old-school throwback."
"Cons: It's not cheap, but it doesn't pretend to be.."
"There are definitely places with better views (the dining rooms are all paneled with hundreds of pictures of visiting dignitaries and celebrities), and hipper, but I'll take this place anyday."
Wonderful location and delicious food
"Very famous, but normal."
Good Vasque tapas.
Excellent location.
Maybe too much foreign visitors.
Good price-quality relationship.
An excellent option if you are around Passeig de Gracia-Plaça Catalunya if you want to eat something
I lived in Tenerife for 6 months and this is after several holidays to the place.
"I always make a trip to Harleys, the food is decent, the service a bit slow but the desserts and cocktails more than make up for the service."
It is a typical American Diner everything is served with chips.
"This long established restaurant is on the same road as L`Adjustada, Tapas6`9 and La Paella."
From a small entrance it opens out to a large L shaped seating area which can handle about 70 covers.
There is a small open courtyard with four tables.
"Not a place for ""fine dining""-the main attraction is the great value Menu Dia with a choice of 6 or 8 starters and main courses, mostly for Northern European tastes -very few Spanish dishes."
"Giant salads,enormous bowls of soup,smoked fish as starters and then plates piled high with meat and two veg are the order of the day and it attracts many regulars , mostly from Germany,Holland Belgium and GB.Desserts are limited as most don't have space after the main meal-real trencherman food."
"Service from the owner Rosa,her family and the staff is quick,cheerful and efficient."
"Many smokers and only a small non smoking area ,and on a couple of occasions we have had to suffer continuous chain smoking throughout a meal."
"However , it is popular with many and is generally busy."
"We've eaten here twice when visiting Benalmadena and, although the food isn't quite up to the standard of the nearby Mar de Alboran, El Mero is our favourite eating place in the area."
"It is situated right in the Marina - so the view is excellent, and the food (not surprisingly, dominated by fish) not far behind."
I can't think of too many better ways of whiling away an evening.
Went to El Mero last week on our vacation in Benalmadena.
"We are lovers of fish restaurants and it looked pretty impressive, lovely views, nicely laid out."
There were five of us in total and we ordered a starter each and a main course.
"having three young teenagers with me, the very rude waiter insisted that they put their napkins on their laps."
"The starters were very good as a whole, however, my daughter did not like her soup, she wasnt offered an alternative, i had a taste and it was tasteless."
"THe waiter, again very rudely, ""tutted"" and took the soup away."
The main course was enjoyable.
we noticed that the waiter was concentrating on other tables and we pretty much felt ignored!
possibly because the other clientelle appeared to be older.
I found this particularly offensive as our money is as good as anyones.
we had deserts and a bottle of wine.
the bill was €380.
By no means cheap and I would have expected a fair FRIENDLIER service from the staff.
"We travel to Benaldmadena at least twice a year, I will not be recommending this restaurant, nor will I will be going back."
Had lunch and dinner here.
"Had pizza and garlic bread for dinner, both of which was extremely tasty, well cooked and well presented."
For dinner we had pasta and garlic bread again as it was so delicious.
The service was very friendly and efficient.
"The toilets were very clean, inkeeping with the rest of the restaurant."
"My only complaint was that it was a smoking restaurant, allthough this is the same for most restaurants/bars in lloret de mar."
GOD i love QuQu !!!
"not the pure traditional tapas bar, but this is the best for me : a tasty mix of original and modern tapas."
"ok a lot of tourists but i dont care when i have my ""delices de brie"" and my ""tatin de platano"""
Really good Tapas sized plates!
Small so be there early or be prepared for a long wait line... Modern Spanish food and really good price!
Had a pleasant meal in September at a table on the rear patio.
My wife chose a medium sole from the display at €12 rather than the giant menu one at €22 and I had pork fillet.
We started with one of the best pan tostados we have eaten.
One mistake - the main course does not come with veg which is extra so my fillet looked very lonely on the plate until some salad and chips arrived.
"Nice rioja, beer and agua con gas and the usual crema catalan."
Bill €48- good value especially as my wife (the fish expert) thought the llenguado a la plancha was the freshest and tastiest she has had in Tossa and my fillet of pork was perfection!
Very expensive given the reasonably priced tapas restaurants located throughout the city.
"The ingredients were not fresh (vegetables must have been frozen and were over cooked, sauce was not prepared freshly ... came from a jar)."
The food was mediocre at best.
The service was lacking for a restaurant that is advertised and written up as a finer dining experience.
Having eaten in fine restaurants around the world ... this is not one.
Do yourself a favor and do not be lured by the lovely setting!
"Well, definitely he is not into public relations."
"I was there with a group of friends visiting and while we were having one of our personal conversations in one of the tables inside, he man invited himself into it and made us feel very embarrassed, not to say something else."
"We quickly finished our meal and left, what an unpleasant situation."
Really a pity we didn’t read Michael’s review first.
"Regular costumers must be the only ones welcomed, who knows."
"Very original place, you can eat at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the food."
"Or just take a table and enjoy all the types of food you can imagine: Asian, Mediteranean, Catalan, Italian etc etc."
"Everything fresh from the market, located in the same building."
Modern scandinavian design.
This restaurant was recommended both in Lonely Planet and Frommers and it did not disappoint.
"The lamb with honey, spinach and pinenuts was good, and the gazpacho was above average."
"We were recommended Casa Pedro by some friends who said the food was great, they were not wrong, the steak we had was out of this world however i would not go back as the services was awful, not one of the staff smiled the whole time we were there, in fact we were made to feel like we were not welcome!"
!
7 Portes is a landmark in Barcelona and you can taste best spanish flavour
Smartest restaurant in El Palmar with glorious views of the beach and sea --- stunning sunsets.
"It's in the Michelin Guide which implies good standards of hygeine, presentation and service, and of course good food."
"Stunningly fresh fish, especially the local tuna between May and June."
Around 65 euros for two with excellent house wine and fizzy water.
"Told by a friend to go south and find the mountains round Alberca, we stumbled upon El Castillo in time for lunch."
The workmen were in and the tables set for regulars.
Mis-translating meant I got a local bean soup instead of the intended (weather appropriate) bean salad but it was superb.
Main courses were hearty and tasty.
Wine and water in pitchers.
Staff very friendly and tolerant of ad-hoc arrivals.
"Getting there is not for everyone but, if you do get to the region, it is honest tasty food and honest pricing and who can ask better than that?"
lovely decor and definetaly the best indian food in barcelona.good service.little expensive though.the dal and butter chicken were as good as the ones u get in delhi.
A favourite lunch place.
"This family hostel , just at the start of the walk outside of the castle walls , was originally a fish processing factory owned by the family but the three buildings were converted 52 years ago into a bar and hostel - now run by mother and daughter."
"Get a decent seat under a brolly , a glass of chilled rosado in your hand and watch the world go by - every nationality , many languages, every fashion style , every shape and size and remember they are clocking you as well - guess the nationality is good fun."
A decent light menu together with an extensive tapas list together with the best sardines in Tossa makes this an excellent choice for lunch.
"On our return visit we felt it was still as good as ever for a light lunch , chilled rosado and people watching-especially the day trippers that have arrived by boat."
Highly recommend the cod balls followed fresh sardines and freshly made bocadillo atun con pan tomato.
Restaurant is part of the Hotel and we always thought that the bedroom with the balcony above the entrance must be one of the best positions in Tossa.
"Location,location,location as they say."
"Read a review by an American who flew into Barcelona ,caught the train to Blanes and bused to Lloret and then caught the boat to Tossa,arriving with his luggage to check in at the Cap D'Or and he thought it was the most stunning and romantic way to arrive."
Amazing suckling pig!
"The meat was really moist and tender, the skin was crispy, just the right amount of salt."
"We also had a salad of giant beans with chorizo which came with a fair amount of offal (beware, as it is not mentioned on the menu)."
Service very good.
Decor was very.... kitsch!
Would definitely go back for more.
"El Bocaito is very typical of traditional Spanish food, Andalusian in particular."
"The plates are none too complicated, but done well, the fish in particular."
The menu also happens to be quite large.
"Its off the beaten path, away from touristy spots, but still foreigner-friendly."
"Situated on the promenade on the way to Mar Menuda,& with good views of the main beach and castle.Two indoor rooms , one non smoking, and an outside pavement terrace."
Popular at lunchtime but quieter and with efficient and friendly service in the evening.
"We started with tomato bread and followed with the speciality dish of Tossa -Zarzuala ,a garlic fish stew.Delicious."
My wife had Solomillo Cerdo Pimieta (steak in green pepper sauce).
The steak was perfectly cooked but the choice of sauce was a mistake as it was made with butter and overpowered the meat.
We would have it plain grilled next time.
Desserts were a crocanti ice and a cafe irlandes.
"Bill , including house red and a beer came to €49.75-good value."
"Good food, and some good memories, but also remember it being a bit pricy."
"Great, traditional atmosphere though!"
"Touristy yes, but still a great atmosphere and good traditional food."
Loved it.
"Nice atmosphere, very friendly service, food below par, high prices."
The mariscada's shellfish was not too fresh and the overall rating of the evening was not positive.
"No spanish around, only tourists."
Get further away from the ramblas and find some place where the locals go !
This probably rates as one of the top three restaurants on this part of the coast.
The restaurant itself is extremely attractive set with tables around a lovely swimming pool and garden.
At night it is flood light and enchanting.
"There is also an air-conditioned restaurant, which is very elegant and very professionally run."
The food is excellent - fresh and creatively presented.
"We had a poached pear with Roquefort cheese, parfait of ” Foie gras” and Nuts for a starter which was followed by a succulent Chateaubriand."
Our dessert was a symphony of chocolate mousse.
There is an extensive and well priced wine list.
This is definitely a restaurant to go to for a special celebration or a romantic evening for two.
Telephone number is 965 830 977 and their website is www.puerto-blanco.com
Best Mexican food in Madrid (so far!)
really nice restaurant that is very popular with the locals.
Hard to get a table at the weekend.
"During the week the menu del dia is very good value, however, the menu del dia is verbal and not written down so it helpsif you have a little grasp of Spanish."
The normal menu is written down so less of a problem here.
We booked a table at La Barraca for our first Friday night in Madrid.
It was fairly full when we arrived and a waitress checked our reservation and promptly sent us downstairs - I don't especially have a problem with sitting downstairs to eat but I do resent being sent downstairs to eat with all the other tourists and the locals are allowed to stay upstairs.
It really made us feel very uncomfortable - like second class citizens.
I used to live in Madrid and speak fluent spanish so I asked a waiter why we'd been sat in the basement and he said they always put tourists downstairs.
Charming!
"The food was also slightly disappointing, quite salty and very saffrony but the chicken and fish etc was nicely cooked."
Quite pricey for a paella so wou;dn't recommend it.
This is a truly excellent restaurant.
"It is family driven, there is a loving atmosphere."
You feel at home at once!
The kitchen is superb.
"Wonderful people, excellent service, outstanding food!"
"I visited this restaurant several times during my stay in Alcudia in week 25, 2008."
"To my knowledge, this is the best restaurant in the area."
"If you visit Port d'Alcudia, you have to visit Garlanda as well."
"Go have lunch there, or a cup of coffee or maybe a glas of cider or wine in the bar."
Or have about a complete tasty dinner in the evening.
"You will not regret it if you appreciate good food and a loving, relaxed atmosphere!"
peter@lundjakobsen.dk
One of my favorite restaurants in Madrid!
"Their food, the decoration and the desert!!!"
"Do not leave without trying their ""Issimos del Bazaar"" or the ""Chocolatissimo"""
"muy bien de precio, cantidad y todo riquísimo lo peor que no puedes reservar por teléfono"
I almost want to keep it a secret ....outside you cant imagine what kind of a treat you are in for.
"Try the grilled rabbit and the ""gambon""."
The best place in the area no doubt about it.
Delicius Argentinian Food.
Real Italian food for very affordable prices.
"Food is very good and there are plenty options for little children (say maccarroni in a dozen different sauces) and adult alike (la proposta: ""linguine al cartoccio"")."
Service is very fast and professional.
Pizzas here are a feast!
"Don't expect dessign rest rooms, thought (say, them are so gloomy)"
"Based on my previous experiences in other countries, restaurants located on the main tourist routes are usually bad or average but Spain is an exception."
"Sirena Verde is located on Gran Via, few minutes from Callao underground station towards Plaza de Espana."
They serve mainly sea food and fish (I have not tried the meat dishes).
The dishes are simple but very nice.
"I have only been in the restaurant section upstairs, the best tables are the non-smoking ones, with views on Gran Via."
Staff is very friendly and make you feel welcomed.
"I have been there twice, both times ""early"" in Spanish dinner time terms (around 20:00) and the place is quiet and service is fast, possibly it can get crowded after 21:30."
I will definetely go back when I return to Madrid.
Excellent position on beach and adjacent to the similarly-named Francisco's Fontanilla.
Excellent fish (what else!!)
"beautifully presented, a real meal in a bowl fish soup, the best gazpacho (and don't forget to ask for the garnish of onion, peppers, tomato and cucumber --- like most places it's not automatically provided and costs nothing)."
Usual meal for two with good house wine 50-60 euros.
A lot of the fish is sold by weight so if you have one of the lobster or similar offerings --- check your credit card first!!
"My stunning langosta was huge, delicious and 50 euros!!!!!!!"
Worth every penny
We stumbled across this fab little restaurant completely by accident!
It was sheer curiousty which prompted us to embark on the hazardous drive down the moutain face to the port of Valldemossa (about 5km from Valldemossa town).
"Yes, it's scary and not for the faint hearted, but I put all my trust in my husband's driving, shut my eyes and hoped!"
"The restaurant is the focal point of this tiny tiny harbour village and sits on the sea front where you will probably find the odd person sunbathing on the sea wall and taking a dip in the ocean's edge (where proper ""swimming pool"" ladder steps are provided for ease of access into the beautifully clear water)."
"On entering Es Port, we were taken upstairs and shown to a table boasting a beautiful ocean view."
The fish menu was lengthy and interesting and definitely to be recommended!
"We settled on a ""Turbot for Two"" and enjoyed our starters of fish soup and prawns in garlic and chilli oil whilst we waited."
"The turbot was presented to our table whole, in a huge platter."
"On our nod of approval, the waiter then filleted and served up our two plates."
I have rarely tasted such deliciously prepared fish - simple but absolutely gorgeous.
"I'm afraid to say I really can't remember the prices, but that's a reflection on how reasonable and unremarkable they are!"
"I would heartily recommend this restaurant for good, traditional food served by a friendly team in beautiful surroundings."
Go - you'll love it!
"This an attractive modern restaurant, with incredible views looking out across the Darro river valley to the Alhambra beyond, which is floodlit at night."
We thought the food was excellent and reasonably priced.
"Our starters included Spinach crêpes with shrimps, raisins and pine nuts and my husband had a cerviche of pickled tuna."
Our main courses included Moroccan pastilla (a wonderful chicken pie with a cinnamon pastry) and Cod loins with alioli brandade on a layer of potatoes.
We also had an excellent bottle of white Macabeo and Chardonnay wine from Bodegas Castano.
The service was very professional.
The easiest way to find this restaurant is to walk up the Careterra del Darro (i.e.
beside the Darro river in the old town).
Paseo del Padre Manjon is an extension of the Careterra del Darro.
We will definitely go back again.
Definitely worth a visit as it has a good selection and the tapas are tasty.
Probably not very cheap but in the ramblas area you can find much more expensive places for quite less quality.
Recommended.
Be prepared to wait for a bit to be seated - the other option is to try to sneak a seat at the counter or eat standing near it.
They serve * Tapas: small portion of food served on a plate --> recommend Pan con Tomate + plate of Jabugo  * Montigo ??
: Little pieces of bread with the food of the tapas on ti - slightly smaller than those (1 or 2 bites)  --> recommend Mini HAmburgesa and Jabugo y Datil * Flautas ??
": mini baguettes filled with jamon or other stuff  If you eat at the counter you can actually see all the ""montigos"" available and point at them to be served (in case you have no idea on what to order)  They have more than 15 different types of beers."
"For tapas, we could not make up our mind between 4 Gats and Ciudad Condal."
"We stopped at 4 Gats first, but did not see many people inside and the menu looked limited."
This place was where Picasso staged his very first exhibition (Carrer Montsio 3).
"On the recommendation of another guest at the hotel, we decided to check out Ciudad Condal."
We were glad we did as it was busy and got busier as we were leaving.
My husband enjoyed the mini burgers with the carmelized onions on top.
"We shared the shrimp sautéed in olive oil, calamari, and I had the manchego cheese and sautéed green peppers sprinkled with sea salt."
The pitcher of white sangria made with Cava went down quite easy….I finished it all by myself!!
!
"One stop shop for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
Great all around.
"Be warned that this is a very busy place, popular with both locals and tourists."
If you can't get a table it's worth it to sit at the bar and watch the fresh food get cooked and served.
"While friendly to foreigners the place doesn't specifically cater to them, but well worth struggling through with what little Spanish you might have."
Beer is house specialty but excellent wines too.
Prices good by European standards for an above average eatery.
"went to mamabels for our last night excellent friendly service, food was also excellent, wine even better reasonable price mamabel is a very special lady."
My wife and I had a very enjoyable tapas style lunch here during our mid- May 2008 tour of Extremadura and Castile & Leon.
Meson Cervantes is an upstairs restaurant/bar which has windows overlooking the Plaza Mayor - grab one if you can.
"We thought the food and service both excellent, in this extremely popular and busy eating/drinking venue."
This has the finest position in Tossa-opposite the main entrance to the Castle in C/Portal.
"A well renowned and popular restaurant , especially with Catalans who spend long lunches here at the weekends."
It has a large sunny terrace which can be protected from either the sun or inclement weather by a stylish velum.
A sign of a well run place is continuity of staff - some have been here for 20 years!
"The owners of Sa Muralla (who also own the Miramar,next to Sa Barca and Rom Vell) have made a decision to move up market rather than compete with the herd and have revamped the restaurant and the menu."
"Even the menu dia is €17+, food only."
"We had two delicious meals one in May and another recently in June , the first sharing a starter of grilled vegetables followed by magret (beautifully cooked and presented) and Lenguado plancha and then pushed the boat out with two lovely puds - Gourmet Baileys and Miel y mato almendra."
"A bottle of Torres de casta , a beer and two complimentary desert wines from the boss finished off a great meal."
"Not cheap at €74.42 but a ""once a hols treat""  ."
On the second occasion we shared a large plate of grilled asparagus and my wife had a lovely grilled sole (ON the bone)and I had again had the duck magret with rasberry sauce.
It was beautifully cooked and presented and was SUPER.
We went to town on the puds - Fresh pineapple with hot catalan custard and for me a almond and honey ice cream.
Complimentary drinks followed by a bill for €76 including a bottle of rose and a beer.Although it was by far our most expensive meal it was super.
We will save up to return!
If you are looking for a tasty huge piece of beef then look no further it´s here you will find it.
The T bone fills the plate and the chips are in a seperate dish.
They do a lady´s fillet just enough for my liking.
The meat is cooked on a wood burning grill and you can see it being cooked.
The waiter/ess speak english and service is excellent .
"Lovely Views , Food was very good , not really cheap but nice for a special meal ."
"Take a cardigan though , air condioning a bit powerful ."
Walked into this restaurant after a day of touring.
At 8 p.m. nearly all tables were empty; when we left there was a waiting line.
Seemed like a local crowd.
The modern decor and upstairs location a few blocks north of Placa Catalunya were pleasing.
Big windows and from our table you could catch a glimpse of Gaudi's Casa Batllo.
Food was consistently good and there's a large and well-priced wine list (good bottle was 16 euro).
"Service could be better, particularly once it filled up, but wasn't enough to complain about."
We'd go back.
"Original place, modern design but cosy."
Mexican/Mediterenean dishes at good price.
We really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of this restaurant.
"The food was really first class, but a little over priced."
"That said, we would probably come back."
My husband and I live near to this restaurant and had heard it recommended many times so we decided to try it last month.
We were very disappointed on just about every count.
Interestingly since we've been we've struggled to find anyone now who is complimentary.
Maybe we were just unlucky but I don't think so !
Pre dinner drinks were beautifully served with well presented 'nibbles' and we perused the menu at our leisure.
From here things took a turn for the worse.
On ordering our food the owner waxed lyrical that I had chosen a fillet steak served 'blue'.
If only we had more customers who ate it this way he said.
Eventually we were shown into the dining room and I have to say we were shocked.
Umpteen packed in tables of 10 so tightly packed you could hardly move between them ( the waiters banged our table frequently without even a backward glance they were so busy).
The noise level was unbelievable.
It was like walking into a strangers rowdy wedding party after everyone had at least 2 bottles in them.
The steak came with not a drop of blood in sight although the head waiter helpfully offered to take it away and 'COOK IT SOME MORE?!.
Later the owner presented me with another piece of raw fillet steak on a saucer which he prodded to show that there was no blood hence chef had not been able to serve it that way.
My question then is why put it on the menu ?
"Throughout the meal we were buffetted by the waiting staff as previously said (once we had to completely rearrange the condiments etc), however we were also entertained."
There was a tenor which implies some sort of classical bent however he sang a selection of Frank Sinatra and the like with what sounded like a hammond organ.
"Later still there were excellent flamenco dancers however it seemed most unfortunate that whilst we were still eating, at the end of their act, they invited audience participation."
The small child was cute but the drunken lady followed by the very overweight man staggering around the stage left us in utter disbelief.
Needless to say we left.
To his credit the owner was most apologetic.
I almost can't wait for the next person that I encounter that tells me it's a wonderful restaurant !
Maybe if you are in a large party with an occasion to celebrate it is the place for you but smaller groups think twice.
I have been to this restaurant a few times manly because my friend knows it well and has been going there for years.
Although a beautiful restaurant in a wonderful location I do think it is resting on its laurels.
I would say this restaurant is best for people of a certain age i.e.
over 50 because that is the age range that the entertainment is geared at.
The last time I went there which was in the last week my food was so salty that I couldn't eat it.
We had a surly waiter who really needs to get another job.
We also had items on our bill that we hadn't paid for.
Go there by all means but check your bill!
A charming restaurant on the mountain road between Alhama de Murcia and Mula (c3315).
"I often visit this restaurant even though it is 30 minutes drive from my home in Mazarron, it is a lovely small restaurant with fantastic mountain views from the terrace, the service is excellent and the food is always mouthwatering and good value for money (4 course lunch from 10 euros), they let us use the pool before and after our meal and could not be more hospitable....highly recommended."
"We are lucky to have Rancho Chico right below our holiday apartment, its a medium sized restaurant with seating inside and out, the food and service are excellent , its situated under the Los Delfines apartments near the magic roundabout."
Definitely the best food you will eat in Alcudia.
"Don't miss the opportunity to eat in this restaurant, I guarantee you will go back again"
"El Botijo started in Malaga, owned by Gaby and Jose from Haro, the main Rioja town in Northern Spain."
"The Malaga restaurant is always full of locals (I have never seen a tourist in there) due to the excellence of their meat, and lamb in particular."
The appetizers and the main courses are simple presentations.
"For example, grilled asparagus is exactly that with sea salt and virgin olive oil."
What they lack in flourishes they make up for in the quality of the ingredients and excellent of the cooking.
There is a decent wine list of about 35 drinkables rather than an extensive selection.
They opened a second restaurant just off the Carihuela in Torremolinos where Jose presides.
"The decor in very Spanish looking with dark woods, mounted animal skulls and paintings on the wall."
The skulls are real and remainders from Jose's hunting trips.
Dinner for 2 approximately 80 Euros including a 20 Euro wine (There are many below and some above).
"What an awful, almost comically bad lunch."
"Conveniently located near the wonderful Alhambra, our expectations were set for standard tourist fare - little did we appreciate that we were to be reeducated as to how poor that experience can be."
"Several of our table of six started with the Andulacian Soup - a regional speciality no less, and how special it was: semi-cooked egg, unidentifiable (but almost certainly mechanically recovered) meat, cooking oil, sultanas and other assorted left-overs, all cunningly disguised under a tepid garlic broth, giving the overall impression that the chef has behaved like an incontinent child, who, having soiled his bed, expects to remain undiscovered because he has pulled the duvet cover over."
"Mains, astonishingly, were worse."
The goat in garlic transpires to be anonymous offal drenched in a garlic brine that fails to persuade one to believe that fat-plus-kidneys equals meat.
The special omelette is a discus of grout: a uniform grey mass of turgid matter.
The sharer-fish-platter is a triumph of flotsum and jetsum disguised by grey deep-fried batter.
Overall a theme of disguising vile and inedible food beneath garlic pastes or grey batter emerges - however the disguise did not succeed - the most any of our party managed to eat out of any of our dishes was 10%.
"The meal was rounded off by an aggressive manager refusing to split the bill across multiple credit cards, despite there being no prior notice if this policy."
"In summary - avoid this place at all costs - by doing so you make the mouth-raping experience, that we had to endure, somewhat worthwhile."
Staff rude.
Food more or less.
Expensive
This is a lovely place.
Typically spanish food but great standard.
"The standard of service is very professional which is lovely and they treat you very well, but aren't all over you, which is perfect."
The menu is very big and wine list is reasonably priced for good wine.
It is definately worth a visit.
I would recommend the lamb shank for 2 persons.
A wonderful restaurant.
Great service and ambiance.
Owner Xavi was very gracious and welcomed us warmly.
The food was outstanding.
In the 'Gran Chaperal' shopping center this Spanish Bar/restaraunt is great value for money with frindly staff and great service.
They make the best Paella ever outside the residential areas on the Island.
Prices are equal if not better than other bars and makes a fantastic change from the copious amounts of 'British Bars' After all why travel all that way and do what you can do 7 nights a week at home.
Perfect escape to another world.
Best burgers in town!
Get here early because lots of people come here even during the week!
"This restaurant, which is very close to the Mirador de San Nicolas, is very romantic and serves excellent food."
The restaurant itself is in an old villa with a garden in front of the Alhambra.
"The views from the terrace and the restaurant are exceptional, particularly at night when candles are lit and floodlights shine across the ravine upon the Alhambra."
"The dining room is a series of small rooms, all with floor to cieling windows with Hispano-Moorish decorations."
The food itself was beautifully presented and delicious.
"On the pricey side, but well worth it."
Great Noodle bar.
"Stylish and tasty but too many people and some meals are not what they are supposed to be (i didnt recognize the OyakoDon... wrong sauce i guess, a lot a savour is a bit different than in asia to fit to the spanish)"
"Having lived out in Malgrat for six months, I would not have enjoyed my taste of Catalunya as much had I not visited this place on a weekly basis."
The food is simple as is the decor which adds to the full experience of eating here.
"The chicken is to die for, never have I tasted anything quite as enjoyable, if you thought you could never eat a whole chicken to yourelf and suck the bones dry, then try this place!!"
"To enjoy the full experience I can whole heartedly recommend having a chicken EACH with catalan bread, Serrano ham, Manchego cheese and patatas frittas and a carrafe of the house red (to share, I am not greedy!)."
Eat here once and you will be back.
I have just spent four days in Barcelona and for one of those days I hired a car for the day just to travel back and eat here.
"If you want Sausage egg and chips with waiters that speak English leave this place alone, to those of us who appreciate good food when we eat it."
I will be back.
Mamma Ttina is the only non-Spanish restaurant you will find in Arcos.
The small restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff is friendly.
"The prices are great considering the value - 7 euro for a salad, 6-12 euro for BIG pizzas."
The pasta was especially good - we got the 'chef's special' which had a countless number of delicious ingredients.
Their chocolate crepe is a bit rich - but what else would you expect??
This may be the best Italian food in Spain!
"We've been in Spain for a week, and were looking to eat something other than Spanish cuisine."
This Italian restaurant hit the spot.
"All 4 of us liked our appetizers, salad and entrees."
"Comfortable environment, friendly service (Italian waiter, American customers and shaky Spanish on both sides resulting in lots of fun hand-waving)."
Great choice if you're up for a change of pace.
Best Indian food we ever had was found along the Costa del Sol of Spain.
We went for our 1yr anniversary in Sept 2007.
"Thanks Milan Restaurante from the couple from Washington, DC."
Good food .
Staff Nice
Just went to eat in this place and found a large snail in the salad!
Definatley not recommended!
Don´t eat here!
cochinillo asado...mmmmmmm!!!
!
Went all in for the tasting menu.
"5 courses listed, but actually 7 plus an amuse."
Soft shell razor clam - never would have expected to eat that.
The whole thing was stunningly presented and tasted better.
($250 per person)
"One of the most hype restaurants in Barcelona, the menu is interesting and the service good."
Stop by the bar for a drink before leaving
A very popular meat restaurant - just down from the church opposite the old flamenco bar on S.Pere.
"Adrian bought out the original Swiss owner some 16 years ago , having worked for him for 12 years previously.Very loyal following with lots of regulars but not clicky."
"We always go at least once and have never , ever , had a disappointing meal."
"Great for meat but do be careful which portion you chose - many a carnivore has been defeated by the "" gigantic"" and the ""mixed grill""."
"Our chicken ,pork fillet ,two deserts , wine and beer came to €45.96 On our second visit we just had the house bread to start ,with the peculiar spread (marg and capers?"
)that has been served ever since it was `El Suizo` (is it a Swiss special?)
My wife had her usual grilled chicken and me a super Veal (young beef not Dutch Veal) Tournedos served with baked potato and three sauces.
Super.
Cafe Irlandes and a Poker Crocant to follow all washed down with house red.
€43 !
!
"We had travelled to Alcudia after two hours on the road, and had young hungry children who needed to be fed pronto so we settled more or less on the first place we saw which was this joint."
"Initially it looked, just acceptable, but once we had settled in we noticed the place was really quite grubby."
"Then came the service, the waiters without exception were not only rude, but surly and agressive."
"They barely listened to us place our orders, as if they were under severe pressure, althought he place was empty."
"Then inevitably they got our orders wrong, they brought out one childrens meal, so we had to get the boys to share that while we waited for a second."
Which incidentally was greasy & reheated.
"The fact that they got the order wrong, seemed to inconvenience them more than it did us!"
"Then the adult orders came out again, wrong, we ordered three cheese burgers & got three plain burgers, when I asked for the cheese, my plate was SNATCHED off me, and they brought back a plate with one slice of cheese to do three of us."
"When we called them back to ask for more they ignored us, until we had to go after then, and the waiter rolled his eyes to heavan when we explained we would need three slices of cheese for three burgers."
Again the food was greasy reheated trash.
It is without a doubt the worst dining experience I've had anywhere in my life.
"Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!!!"
"I am pleased to say, that ever restaurant we dined in in Cala D'or where we were staying was a joy."
"All the staff we came across were highly professional & friendly, and the food was consistently fresh, delicious & reasonable."
Santa Ponca has a great many restaurants.
Unfortunately none too many are worthy of review.
"One striking exception is Renos, serving fresh fresh fresh fish, simply prepared .... grilled with lemon and olive oil, with or without garlic."
"Specialties include sea bass baked in rock salt, turbot, dorada, sea bream, chiperones and prawns of all sizes and descriptions.This is where the Santa Ponca and Calvia locals go to eat."
Go early or make sure to call several days in advance for a reservation.
"On Puix des Tex, opposite the entrance to Hotel Pionero."
Great place to eat in an unfussy environment not geared to tourists.
Used to go there at least once a week when we lived in Palma and is now the first place we dive into to eat on return visits.
"Having been to Palma last year for a recce for my 40th celebrations this year, Abaco was high on my list for a cocktail before dinner, unfortunately I didn't realise that it didn't open until 8pm so as I had family with me that were leaving for a very early flight back to the States the next morning and parents that didn't want to eat too late we just went for a quick 'look-around' once it had openend its doors for the evening."
I returned with my husband and my sister and my brother in law a few evenings later.
The house still has its impressiveness and the amosphere and suroundings are beautiful but some of the staff let it down badly.
This establishment is obviously a popular tourist attraction and quite honestly the staff are just 'going through the motions'.
One particular staff member was not much short of plain rude as we asked what was in some of the cocktails as there was no description of any of them on the menu and at 15 Euros each it was important we got the right one!
"A friend of mine on the first night asked a waiter about the ritual that is done on Friday evening at midnight with the rose petals and again, his answer was just perfunctory and he lacked a lot of interest in our interest."
Its a nice enough place to be in but I wouldn't rush back - at 60 Euros for 4 fairly uninteresting cocktails I'd rather spend it on tapas and a great bottle of red around the corner in 'La Cueva'
Cosy place with a good price/quality ratio.
"It's always a good sign when you see a restaurant with a lot of locals dining - this fact, and the menu offerings attracted my wife and I."
On the food side we were not dissapointed.
The quality and food presentation were spot on.
Indeed my wife's steak ( Entrecot con salsa Roquefort ) was the best we have tasted for many a year (I say we because it was so big I had to eat some of it too).
Indeed both the meals and wine were excellent and good value.
"The service was very good, but we felt the staff could have been more relaxed - they all looked very serious; no smiles - a bit too formal."
"Maybe it was because we were not locals, or indeed Spanish"
"Situated around the corner from the Senator Gran Via Hotel, Gran Via metro station, great food and great prices as is illustrated by the queues of locals patiently waiting for their turn to be seated."
"This is a lovely little bar with a good atmosphere, pleasant staff and excellent tapas."
They specialise in a cocktail called Caiprinha - well worth trying.
Bar food is also served at cosy little tables.
Good music.
We went back to this bar a number of times during our weekend visit to Granada.
It is located very centrally in the old town alongside the Darro River.
Good food
"We are going back to Santa Ponsa for the fourth time this year, and each year it gets better and better."
"El Ceibo is a fabulous restaurant, the food is wonderful, the staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble for them."
The best tapas bar atmosphere in Barcelona.
Very warm and inviting with friendly staff.
"Food excellent, pleasing to the eye, fresh, very very tasty and not expensive."
A wonderful find.
Someone recommended this restaurant to us and we weren't disappointed.
"The food is fantastic, mainly seafood, but also some Canarian meat specialities."
The food was all spanish or Canarian and was delicious.
The waiters all speak fluent English and there is an English version of the menu.
There were 4 of us and we ate a main and a desert each plus wine and soft drinks.
the total price was around 100 euros.
On arrival the waiters bring you a glass of sherry (or orange juice for non drinkers) while you read the menu and some fantastic fresh bread strainght from the oven.
"The portions of food are large, especially the meat dishes - so pace yourself to make sure you get to the great cakes at the end!"
"The building is really interesting, it opens up inside into a courtyard which is open to the sky and Canarian balconies on the upper level."
The building itself is worth a visit.
We went twice during our week stay and could have gone more often if we had discovered it earlier in the week.
I think in August you will probably have to book because it was busy even in May.
The owner is friendly and outside of the hotel seemed nice enough but the long narrow road leading to it went through quite a run-down area where people were burning all sorts of things.
We only ate at the restaurant before deciding if we wanted to book a room and were the only ones there except for another couple who arrived later.
"The owner proudly left us into the hands of ""Lurch""."
My wife ordered cod while I ordered sirloin and a 1/2 bottle of white wine.
When a full bottle arrived Lurch tried to rationalize that we would still be under the Spanish legal drink driving limit if we drank a whole one.
"It turns out they didn't have half bottles of white, just reds."
Well Lurch wasn't happy and decided surfing the web was more important.
Our tepid food arrived some time later on cold plates.
My wife said she had tasted better cod and mash in the UK and I was stunned that the sirloin consisted of a coarsely ground beef hamburger for which I paid 21 Euro.
We couldn't wait to leave this place.
rhein restaurant in santa ponsa june 2008 had a really nice meal here recently.
as a family of three we ate different places every night and found this place to be very reasonable .
"the staff were really nice and work really hard , most nights theres a queue outside waiting for a table."
after been seated the waiter brought out a bowl of olives and bread hot rolls with garlic dip very tasty.
starters i had mallorican soup which is a baked dish of veg.
yum.
wife had tomato soup and daughter had spagetti carbonarra which was big enough for a main course.
for the main course i had shoulder of lamb baked in a dish of potatoes and veg.
"absolutely mouth watering perfectly cooked , wife had chicken with pepper sauce jacket potato and daughter had steak with chips , desserts lemon mousse , profiteroles and daughter had chocolate cake ."
two bottles of bud two large bottles of water and one sprite all for 37 euro .
"excellent value for money , very tasty food and polite and very hard working staff ."
"For all of you that are crazy about the beautiful game, try Casa Juan after any Real Madrid game and you will certainly meet one of Madrid's finest footballers."
"Food is good, the atmosphere is nice and only parking is hectic ... unless you give it to the valet."
"Excellent food, with a mix of traditional and modern meals."
Try the strawberries salad with parmesan and jamon!
and for dessert the chocolate strawberries...
Fantastic restaurant in the heart of Begur with a friendly staff
"food, service and local are good."
The only problem is the price; tasting menus are over 70€.
The small one is a bit small even if they assure you that it's big enough for a dinner.
Food is a bit experimental; a couple of dishes are amazing but others are too much of a gamble.
Desserts are excellent.
Wonderful
Wonderful gastronomic restaurant (from the fantastic Aiguaclara hotel).
"The setting is lovely, the staff is the niciest you can meet there and the food is AMAZING."
A tasty experience for a reasonnable price (around 50-100 euros for two)
Above average - just - for the resort.
"The road running along side the row of very similar marina restaurants was on the route of the ""tourist train"" which was full of staring tourists and belched diesel fumes, this passed all the restaurants every half hour or so, no big deal just annoying!"
"We found the staff most helpful, indeed there were many of them and all eager to serve."
"We especially enjoyed the starters, the carpaccio of beef was outstanding.... and we chose and shared 5 of them as our meal and avoided the gargantuan portions of meats that other adjacent customers were chomping on."
"""Fresh fish"" - which were sold as daily specials - were available but 3 times the price of the frozen!"
What a sad inditement of the Meds condition!!!
"We chose a ""bin end"" wine which was not only half price but of very good quality."
Prices as UK thanks to a weak £.
Worth a visit.
The club itself was great.
Top location and good crowd.
Be careful of the bouncers though.
One member of our party was not allowed in and told he must pay 100 euros to get in to join the group.
The bouncers evicted someone from the club and kicked him when on the ground too.
"If you can get through the door, you should be in for a good night"
"Fine food, very nice interiors, entertaining waiters"
A quaint lovely restaurant that makes choosing meals simple - 3 tasting menus available and 7 courses follow.
1 tasting menu is always the surprise menu chosen by the chef - and always seems to be our favorite.
"Con Gracia has also thoughtfully aligned a wine tasting accompaniment to each tasting menu - allows for perfectly matched glasses of wine with each serving, you may leave a bit typsy but it will have been delicious."
"Hace un huevo que no voy, en su día me gustó"
Not long ago we had lunch in this restaurant.
Our first impression was not very positive.
There was broken glass on the floor near my chair and the toilet was filthy.
The famous dessert trolley was not very hygienic.
"The waiters were congregated around it talking with one another and the guests were constantly walking past it, but there was no transparent screen to protect the desserts from contamination as is commonly found in modern-day restaurants."
"When the gazpacho was served, the waiter sloshed the soup over the edge of the soup bowl, but he did not offer any excuse for his faux pas, nor did he take the bowl back to the kitchen to replace it with a clean one."
"The food was acceptable, but not particularly special."
"The dessert, however, indeed was delicious."
"When we had finished dessert and asked for another small piece of their specialty, the pastel Cordobes, they were pleased to oblige."
"There was, however, a problem in that, when the waiter cut off a slice of the pastel Cordobes for us, he dropped it on the floor, and without a second glance scraped it off the floor, deposited it on a plate, and served it to us as if nothing had happened."
"We were so surprised that we did not say anything about it at the time, which, with hindsight, was not very smart."
"We, therefore, were unfortunately only able to have a small fork-full, taken from the side of the pastel Cordobes that had not landed on the floor."
"The service was hurried, and we felt that we were practically chased out the door after only one hour."
"All in all, we were terribly disappointed because the restaurant did not live up to its reputation."
"Ok Mexican food... Big restaurant, part of the ""Carlos & Charlie's"" company."
"Fish courses were awesome, and accompanied by inventive sauces."
"Tuna was first rate, and a nightly special was better."
Short but good wine list.
Very friendly service.
(I think average price noted here is a bit low - appetizers can run this much - but it's worth it.)
"Excellent meal, a US classic... but great!"
!
We dine in Italian restaurants often.
"While Spanish food in Madrid was generally quite good, we had to try Pulcinella after several recommendations."
It was among the best Italian restaurants we've experienced anywhere.
"Terrific Insalate Caprese, excellent veal dishes, scrumptious Carbonara, and a fine, affordable wine list."
It would stack up quite nicely against such New York favorites as Piccolo Angolo.
"Great neighborhood, too."
"Really good pasta, but small portions... Waiters and the owner are native italian and they greet you in italian as you enter the restaurant... Great italian experience!"
You have to save some room for their new chocolate and dulce de leche desert!
"One of the best eating places in Mojacar, run by a Spanish family and seems to have been there forever."
"Every year the restaurant remains unchanged in that the food is still excellent (lots of fish dishes as well as meat), hospitality, service and atmosphere is the best."
When you order your first drink you are given some pan and homemade garlic mayonnaise which tastes amazing.
"A sunday lunch is available for 10 euros which includes starter, main meal, sweet and coffee."
Main meals are reasonably priced.
Well worth a visit.
"I went for a substantial lunch including a relish tray, ""Veal"" cutlet with potatoes and veggies and rice pudding for desert."
I put veal in quotes because any cut of beef no matter the age of the animal is called veal (ternera).
The food was prepared nicely and exactly as ordered.
"Service was a bit slow, but attentive."
"If you need something, don't hesitate to signal the waiter."
The menu has a long list of authentic Spanish/Andalusian dishes.
"These are ""down home,"" simple, but tasty affairs."
"There are also some ""modern international"" items like pizza and burgers."
"I won't comment on those, I didn't try them."
"Overall, I was well pleased with the service, quality and price."
We had a wonderful meal at this restaurant.They were very welcoming for us a family including three teenagers.The food was excellent we sat on a beautiful terrace but there was plenty of inside seating if the weather isnt great.Cannot fault food or the service..a complimentary amusee bouche was popular!
!Would recommend to go on a warm summer evening and not too painful on the wallet either.
We went to Le Maria for a supper during a business trip to Madrid.
"It was very, very good food."
"They do not have English menus or many waiters that know English, so ordering was pretty difficult."
But the food was amazing.
"It's a small place, but very stylish."
"We made reservations at 9pm, when the restaurant opened for supper, and by about 10-10:30 the place was packed."
You are supposed to see lots of celebrities there but we didn't (except for the ones on their memory wall).
"We had a starter of baked cheese, it was very good."
On the house they also brought out fried shrimp and Chorizo.
"The Chorizo, Argentina sausage, was by far the best."
For the main course we had two different cuts of Argentina beef and one fish.
(The fish was the last one on the fish section--I can't remember the name).
My fish was moist and very tasty.
"There was an orange colored sauce under which was very smooth, not fruity."
"They also brought us some potato chips, but not your ordinary chips, these looked like mini pillows, fried."
They were very addictive!!
"For desert, we ordered the doulche (something like that), which was vanilla ice cream on top of a cookie covered in chocolate."
On the plate was a vanilla pudding with strips of chocolate over top.
One of the best deserts I've ever had.
They also brought us on the house warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream and these sherbet shooters.
The shooters were the best probably.
"Total for the food we ordered (one starter, 3 meals, 1 dessert, 2 waters, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine) our total was 135 Euros."
A meal to remember!
!
We have just returned from a weekend away to Sevilla.
"Date: 30th May till the 2nd June We have been there on several occasions and it was our first time at this restaurant and the last.It is a shame really as the food was excellent so was the champagne, my gripe is for the 20% service charge for eating on the pavement."
"when we queried the Bill the waiter showed us the menu and in small print on the desert page which I never looked at as I dont really eat sweets was in small print ""there is a 20% service charge for eating on the terrace""(which is basically the pavement) it really spoiled our evening."
Well-priced worker- and family-friendly restaurant.
Child menus are healthy Spanish but child-sized.
"(Speed of service is not McDonalds, either, so anticipate when your offspring are going to get bad-tempered-hungry and let them enjoy the experience of a quiet round-table meal.)"
Tourist menu is fair value and size-O aspirees will want to stick with just the appetiser.
Main menu offers good variety of fish and veg as well as the standard sausage and pork.
The fruity house rose wine is very drinkable and water just keeps appearing.
"Outside terrace overlooking the city valley is very pleasant but if the heat is too much, there is plentiful indoor space."
"decent food, but a bit expensive."
Nice place.
"Food was very nice but, not large portions and not able to order additional vegetables."
Men Do Not Wear open toed shoes.
"We were turned away and had to change shoes , luckily hotel was nearby."
Rather pretentious.
staff not paticularly friendly.
"Thank you El Naranjo Restaurant in Benalmadena, Spain for making our 1yr anniversary special."
The food and atmosphere was excellent even if I embarrased myself by accidentally leaving the ladies room with my dress stuck in my panties.
"Sept 23, 2007 will live forever in infamy."
Being an owner of an apartment only a couple of hundred metres away from El Rancho I go there every so often.
The food is of a basic fashion but if you need to be fed well on a budget in interesting surroundings by a really friendly staff: look no further.
Excellent Wok-food !
"from Japanese rice to Tahi Noodle, you choose what you want in your wok, wait and eat !"
delicious and perfect to eat asian on the beach.
"(never so many people ordering woks so ask for one as soon as u get there then go relax on the beach, come back 1 HOUR after !!!"
really 1h to make a 10 sec' wok)
Where do you start when reviewing the La Llonja Restaurant?
Both my wife and I have been coming to this beautiful part of the island for many years.
There are many places in Port de Pollenca that serve fish - not suprisingly - but few of real stature that leaves such a good impression as this establishment did with us.
La Llonja stands on the site of a former building used by the local fishing merchants.
"We happened to come across it last year, and revisited again last week."
"Under the excellent guidance of its owner Miquel Salom, this restaurant has come a long way in 12 months."
It has an extensive list of fish dishes that blend good produce with both modern and traditional styles of cooking.
"Over the week we enjoyed an excellent wild (not farmed) Turbot, served with a saffron sauce and date risotto, Sea Bream with a ""punchy"" wine and olive sauce, and Hake elegantly combined with capers."
The Portugese chef at La Llonga offers food with a twist - something that is not so easy to find elsewhere in the area.
"Starters are a prelude to a fine dining experience, offering mouth watering dishes such as Seafood Lasagne, or Truffle pasta, through to an excellent and light tempura of Calamari and Prawns."
If you prefer meat or vegetarian dishes you will not be disappointed.
"Deserts are a dream, whether you like something colourful and elegant such as the Lime Parfait, or something indulgent such as the Marscapone Mousse with wild berries."
There is something on the menu for wallets of all sizes.
"It is a welcoming restaurant not only for those expecting a fine dining experience, but also for families (as a friend of mine found when visiting with two young children the week before we arrived)."
"Notably the restaurant offers a very complete ""menu of the day"" for under 30 euros which includes good wine, water, and coffee."
"I have recommended this to a number of friends and family, and everyone has said to me that they would certainly go back to La Llonja when they next visit this resort."
"La Llonja is an honest, hard working, and relaxing place to go."
It deserves recognition for the quality of its produce.
"We have dined at adjacent competing restaurants where you have felt you had been subjected either to ""mass catering"" -or been disapointed at high prices and poor service."
La Llonja stands out as a restaurant we would like to take back home with us every time we go.
Live long and prosper La llonja..
This restaurant (typically Spanish) is run by a lovely Spanish family in the small village of El Berro on the Sierra Espuna regional park in S. Spain.
"Wonderful food and polite and courteous service, good prices and highly recommended."
"we go to san antonio every year and walk through the small streets off the front, we love to go to the lovely restaurant called Es Rebost de Can Prats a great place to have typical local food, the lamb and local fish very good we could eat there every night of the holiday always something different to choose, normally local people eat here."
very friendy atmosphere.
will be back again next year.
A lovely restaurant located close to the Museo del Prado and Museo Thyssen Bornemisza with food for herbovires and carnivores alike.
My husband and I are frequent visitors to this area of Spain and believe this is the best restaurant for miles.
We have eaten here many times and it has never disappointed us.
"The menu changes daily, the food is innovative and Spanish and the setting is delightful."
In the summer the food is served on the terrace around the pool.
"The owners and staff are helpful, friendly and eager to make eating at Amanhavis a great experience for their customers."
Highly recommended.
Myself and my partner were fortunate to find this little piece of heaven up in the hills of Benahavis.
"From the moment we stepped into the Hotel we experienced the warmest welcome from the receptionist ""Lina""."
We did arrive very early and Lina made sure that we were accomodated.
She made sure we had all of the information we needed for our stay and personally showed us to our lovely Spanish style bedroom.
The hotel is gorgeous and the outside must be seen to be believed.
There is a small pool surrounded by the most beautuful planting and a lovely terrace where sunbathing is accomodated.
"The restaurent is located on the terrace near the pool, and is spectacular at nightime."
"Top marks to the staff here, but Lina was the jewel in the crown."
"I would advise anyone who cannot use stairs to choose another hotel, and that's is not a negative comment by any means, they are part of the overall spanish/moorish design of the hotel itself."
"I experienced a little heat stroke during my stay, and I can't thank Lina enough for all her help."
Thanks Lina.
"The Tursia is on the same road , but nearer the sea, than the Costa Brava Hotel and the Don Juan Tossa Hotel and we have always looked at the menu when passing but as we are early eaters , and the place seemed quiet , we never stopped."
"On this occasion , even though only two tables were occupied , we made a effort to go in and sit down and were surprised that half the tables had reserved signs on them and later on at 9pm on this Friday it was nearly full ,and with many different nationalities enjoying the food and atmosphere."
"This place has style - nice table cloths ,table decorations , and colourful serving plates and a comprehensive and varied menu."
"Lubina a la plancha for my wife and pork medallions in pepper sauce for me and both with a delicious selection of grilled vegetables.We shared a dessert and a beer and a bottle of rosado and the bill , for such an upmarket establishment , was a reasonable €55."
After visiting the Asador in Avda.
"Tibidabo, the overall impression was regretfully negative."
"Despite the beautiful setting, the food was just average and the service left ample margin for improvement."
"When we arrived, despite having reserved a terrace table, the Maitre d' offered us a table inside."
"Only after requesting it, were we accommodated outside."
"The same Maitre d' brought us the menu, I asked for set menues but he declined saying that everything was on the list anyway."
Only after mentioning the menus that I had seen on internet did he bring us the four set menus.
Both my wife and I selected the menu seleccion.
"After the appetizers and the salad, we were brought the lechazo."
"When we finished it, the waiter brought us the dessert."
"I asked whether there was a second meat course, as specified in the menu."
"The waiter pretended not to know what was on the menu, went back to the kitchen and came back saying that he had brought us a full leg instead of half and therefore we could not get the chuletillas."
"He also tried to tell us that they were different parts of the same beast and therefore the taste was the same, which only made me more disappointed and upset."
"All in all, a disappointing experience."
"Good food, friendly service."
This is definitely the best restaurant we ate at for 60 euros price range.
"This included a starter to share, drinks and a main course each."
Lovely paella and calamari a la romana.
We ate there 3 times during our stay.
Went here twice.
"So much seafood, I mean tons of big seafood."
The price was good.
Only good paella in Barcelona.
Great location
"The area is a bit rough at night, but the restaurant is quite nice inside."
"Good menu, with interesting items."
"Tried the tiny fried fish (pescado frito) with a copa de cava, very good, freshly fried."
The chuleton (steak for two) was impressive for size and for the tenderness of the meat.
Got it rare and rare was it indeed.
"Despite the menu advertising it grilled on a special charcoal, it was grilled with the aid of gas."
"I must say that I have a special radar for gas smell and taste on BBQ, so I noticed it ."
The meat was nevertheless excellent.
"Service very discreet and efficient, we were the last ones to leave past midnight but there was no sign of trying to throw us out quickly."
Good local wines list at reasonable prices (ask for the separate wine list).
Definitely recommendable.
The service can improve a lot but the food in quite good.
Tradicional with a touch of design.
Best Madrid Restaurant in terms of value for money.
I stayed nearby and tried it twice.
It opens daily at 8.30pm and please go there early as it will be full by the time the place is open.
Mains only Euro 8-12 and desserts for Euro 3-5 and the place is very nice.
In my opinion there are better options for Cocido in Madrid
Good tapas but overpriced.

A little confusing mix.
Love the dining room at the edge of the Santa Caterina market.
One of the best tapas in Barcelona!

Atmosphere is normal and better than most chinese - managed by spanish/filipino couple
Spectacular wine list and great tapas.
I´ve been twice and will go again anytime i come back to Granada.

One of the nicest restaurants in Barcelona.
Nice service & food.
You can eat a very good rice with lobster
Probably one of the best meals of 2008!
"Great menu, great location, great service and great wine"
Loved it.
Even what appeared to be a simple salad was very tasty.
Good priced and great quality burgers
Good tapas at reasonable price.
Friendly waiters and casual service.
It's a good place to eat a very very good rice with fresh seafood
Good food and wide winelist.
Prices have increased recently.
This is a place a enjoyed a lot.
Great relatioship between price/food quality.
"Average, slightly overpriced Argentinian fare, fantastic open-air terrace makes it worthwhile."
Snob tapas bar.
Expensive but good.
Nice service.
One of the best Mexicans in Madrid
Another of my favourites.
Interesting tapas ( great archicokes in sauce ) and solid plates.
Its no way near molecular gastronomi but typical spanish with a variety of tapas and main dishes.
"Good service, always full and a good atmosphere - smoking is allowed and if you trying to quit that is very molesting ( isnt it always)"
Great.
Here comes the japanese executives in Barcelona
Very good tapas.
Also a restaurant.
There are more around Madrid
"Great, friendly service Just Good Food"
Very mediocre food
Used to be the best of Murcia.
personally to classic/ classy for my taste.
Exceptional food and normal hotel menu but expensive and the atmosphere too stiff.
Expensive but good.
"Quite good for groups - the menu has a wide selection of dishes although must recommend the Chuletón steak, done on hot stones -> great to share as everyone gets their steak to their taste"
Good tapas and pintxos.
Crowded.
"Fantastic little Tapas bar used mainly by locals.Superb meals and an array of wines.If you just fancy a drink,they usually serve up a small plate of something,Olives or pork scratchings the norm.Highly recommended."
"Bad service, below expectations."
The best sandwiches
Great food!

"Nice and bid restaurant, Italian food with nice rissotto and bigs and tasty pizzas."
"Maybe a bit expensive, and non-smoking trattoria."
Really good !!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
I can't recommend Mugaritz at all.
The food was really strange and we didn't get the idea at all.
I really like to try new things and love e.g.
The Fat Duck for their new ideas and views on food.
And we had hoped to experience something extraordinaire at Mugaritz but we were so disappointed.
Next best restaurant in the World
Best paella in Valencia ??
or at least one of the best.
Get a table on the porch and get a spectacular view on the lake Albufeira.
I recommend to everybody and very much.
make a reservation before going and make sure its on the porch.
You will not regret
Lovely Restaurant
very nive view over the ocean
We descided to go here because it was recommended by the hotel owner (Fowlers Hotel).
"The staff are very, very helpful."
Location is fantastic.
"The menu good, but you have to like typical Italian food."
"We found the prices in general very high, both for wine and food."
In fact it is hard to find any more expensive in Cala d'Or.
Quality of food is though excelent!
"Don't go here if you are hungry, because the courses are very small!"
"Beautifully decorated dining space, attentive, knowledgeable staff."
"Good wine list, with a number of options that don't break the bank."
Despite the fact that this place scores a Michelin star (and 4!
"knives and forks) this was a remarkably relaxed eating experience, notwithstanding the formal surroundings."
"The food (menu de degustation) was inventive, innovative and superb."
"The only course that we struggled with was the ""sweet"", which was an ice cream risotto with ""rectified cod""."
We could see what the chef was trying to achieve but not why.
Molecular gastronomy taken a step too far?
"One of the party described it as ""good ice cream made in a pan that had previously boiled fish and not been washed""."
"Would I go back - yes, yes - yes."
Next time we will order a la carte and give the cod ice-cream a miss.
Don't be put off by the elegant surroundings.
I was overdressed in smart slacks and an open-necked conventional shirt!
Difficult to find on the back side of 31 de Agosto.
The duck breast and risotto was execeptional!
Las Tinajas is very popular so either make a reservation or be there by 8:30.
The service was very solictitous and polite.
The food is excellent.
We went for the easy option of the Grenadine Set Meal at 42 euros each.
This is a 8-course meal.
"The portions are about right, not huge but you don't feel hard done by either - especially as you have 8 courses to get through."
Add wine and the bill will be around 120 euros for two (£95).
Perfect for a special romantic meal on your trip.
I ordered an organic salad = the salad leaves were brown at the edges and they had included goats cheese without mention on the menu.
I could not eat it.
My main course was fish = too salty to eat even a quarter.
Ordered red wine = was off but they were gracious enough to agree.
My husband's meal was nice and he had ordered the warm prawns and pork fillet.
For those seriously interested in good food DO NOT GO.
"The venue was ""trendy"" rather than a serious gourmet heaven."
This was the worst meal and they even charged us a cheeky cover charge!!!!!!!
I was offered no apology or replacement organic salad without brown leaves or goats cheese.
Best meal - La Brasa in the town.
The service and food were fabulous!
nothing impressive at all about this restaurant.it looks very well on the seafront but the food is only average.
Complained about undercooked chicken and the staff were very rude and unhelpful.
I would not recommend Meson Peppers to anyone
"Just 5 minutes drive from Orgiva is the unassuming village of Tablones, and from the outside the unassuming Jyoti."
After 2hrs of site seeing (in the car) and in need of refreshments stumbled into Tablones hoping something would be open.
The tied up horses and spanish banta gave the place away so we dived in.
The first thing that strikes you is the mixture of rustic charm and modernist furniture.
The low slung comfortable seating and wood burning fire creates a cozy feel.
Outside a large shaded restaurant terrace scattered with pots poses magnificent mountain views and is where my family and i relaxed whilst drinking ice cold mojitos and chatted to the local foke.
"Due to the delicious tapas, service and vibe we plan on revisiting for a meal."
If your planning on visiting the Alpujarras this is a great find!!

A cosy family run restaurant in the heart of cullera's new town.
"Friendly staff and a lovely atmosphere all add to the experience, but it is the food that marks this restaurant out."
Excelent tapas dishes and equally good main courses accompanied by a huge range of quality wines.
I have visited this establishment around 10 times and have never been disappointed.
"The family also run a restaurant by the same name in Faro de Cullera village and, although not as quaint, the food and service are to the same high standard."
I would recommend any visitor to try the Buey.
"This steak is served with traditional hot stones for you to cook yourself at the table, allowing you to have your meat exactly as you would like it!"
and its great fun too!
Situated in an alley by the little chapel off the main square this family owned pizzeria has been in business for over 20 years.
There are 8 tables outside with a further 8 inside on the groundfloor and a larger seating area on the first floor where you can watch your pizza being cooked in the wood fired oven.
Decent menu with local specialities as well as Italian dishes.
Can get very popular but service is quick and cheerful and there is a fast turnover.
"We ate twice in June - on our first we shared an enormous tuna salad and then a pizza tropical , and on our second visit we changed the salad choice for melon with ham -again a good dish."
"On both occasions we drank vino rosado and had the same desserts , a crema catalan and a very alcoholic banana flambeada."
Bill came to around €35 on each visit and it is on our list to return.
It was my first time to Barcelona and I stumbled upon 'Mayura'.
It is one of the best finds that I would recommend to anyone who has any connection with India.
Normally in a foreign country Indian food is 'tailored' to suit the palate of the locals.
"However, the food at Mayura was great and so very close to home."
The decor is exquisite and the people so very friendly.
The cocktails were made to perfection and the entire 'Mayura' experience left you wanting more.
At least one visit when in Barcelona is a must.
I love this place - the food is amazing and the decor is beautiful - would recomend it for anyone looking for an all round great night out.
We were in Barcelona for a week and were recommended this restaurant by a friend of ours.
After endless days of eating tapas and typical Spanish food we found ourselves craving for something different.
"Eating Indian wasn´t really our top priority on a visit to Spain, but as I said - my friend said it was a great place with a fantastic ambiance."
And the place was great.
"Well decorated with a beautiful water bar in the middle, the ambience was tastefully done and very unique and different, rather like someone´s living room."
The service was good and the food was good too.
A great experience overall.
"For me it is always special to visit a city and find something different, where there are few tourists, that only the locals visit and frequent."
Mayura was one of those.
"Didn't have a great experience at Barceloneta - the restaurant was recommended to me by a colleague, so we made a reservation for dinner while in Barcelona for the weekend."
"The entire selection of food we ordered (bar the sorbet for dessert) was incredibly salty, my fish and seafood paella had been doused liberally with soy sauce and was undercooked and the two token prawns on the plate were well overcooked."
"The service was terrible - had to ask for everything twice (even the bill, which isn't usually the case!)."
"Perhaps we hit a bad night, but we couldn't believe the number of people queuing to get into the restaurant, given the quality of the food and the service."
The only nice thing about the restaurant was the outside terrace.
We couldn't wait to leave.
I have absolutely great memories of Botin.
My first experience was as a university student there.
30 some odd years later I returned with a husband in tow and my 30 yr. old pictures in hand.
"Needless to say, the pictures created quite a surprise."
My husband loved the food and we ate there several times during our stay in Madrid.
The owner and waiters could not have been nicer.
"Now, I have the chance to introduce two friends to Madrid and Botin when we travel there in July."
"We especially like the cordero (lamb) and the cochinillo (roast pig) Never mind the people who say it's famous because Hemingway ate there, Hemingway knew good food!"
"Advertised as a vegetarian restaurant, but in reality El Septimo has all kinds of dishes."
The specialty is a dedicated page for vegetarian meals (maybe five of them) on the menu.
I guess this counts as a vegetarian restaurant in Spain.
;)
"it has a nice atmosphere in this restaurant, and there is a pleasant outdoor eating area."
i believe its the only indian on the island so if youre craving a curry this is pretty much your only choice.
the poppadoms and sauces are nice.
"the curry, to be honest, tasted a bit like a ready meal curry from tescos to me."
but my friend liked it a bit more than me.
"i would eat here again, purely based on the fact that i love indian and cant go long without my fix!"
otherwise i wouldnt bother.
"dani is catalan and his wife is thai, and together they have put together the friendliest most authentic thai restaurant in barcelona."
"i am lucky enough to live on the same street as the restaurant, and i frequent petit bangkok a few times a week."
"it´s very affordable (25-30 euro for starters, entres, dessert and drinks for two people), but unfortunatly they´ve done away with their wonderfully priced menu del dia a few months ago."
"now it has become so popular that reservations are a must, and even if you order to go it´s wise to call ahead, otherwise they may be too busy to make your food at rush hours."
"although i am super happy for their success, i admit i´m a bit (selfishly) sad it´s become so popular... you can notice a little but significant dip in quality when they´re super busy."
but that still doesn´t stop me from coming back!
they defintintely need a bigger space (the kitchen is TINY!)
but i´m hoping that day doesn´t come anytime soon... keep in mind they´re closed sundays and mondays.
"recommendations: the first wok on the menu (el primer wok en la carta), the chicken samosas (empanadillas de pollo), the thai street soup with chicken, the mint and shrimp rolls, and the chocolate coulant (tarta de chocolate)."
delicious!!
!
Petit Bangkok is a great little restaurant that is deserving of all of the praise that other reviewers have heaped upon it!
The food is delicious and seems to remain honest to it's Thai roots.
"Booking is a must as with only the 8 tables they do get full quickly, even at lunchtime but even then it is a more personal experience than larger restaurants."
The vegetarian spring rolls were fantastic as was the Pad Thai - both meat eaters and vegetarians are well catered for.
"We hope that Petit Bangkok continues to suceed and gain the praise that it deserves, however let's hope that more custom does not impact on the quality that makes this restaurant so special."
"Always great service, always great steak and always great atmosphere."
Ribeye medium with baked potato and garlic butter and corn on the cob.
bottle of riocha and then round the corner to Pogs for music.....the best night in the world.
We got back from Sevilla last week.
"Overall it was a fantastic experience..we had never been..but we're definetly going back..anyway the last night we were there we stumbled apon the Taberna Coloniales..it was really late and we were looking for somewhere to have dinner..and thought what the heck...lets go here...as soon as we walked in we knew we had chosen the right place, the smell of the food was great...great atmosphere..and then the food came along...i wish we had found this place earlier!!"
"Amazingly, delicious food."
"Really Big serves, we ate and ate and drank and paid 26€ for 2 and a half (our six-year-old son also ate and drank)."
"So if your going to Seville a nd you want great food, then definetly go, you love it."
"Amazing kebabs, open late, cheap."
Great fries.
"good place to take the family.beware you need to book ahead,pizzas are good but my favourite was the spaghetti vongole followed by the tiramisu."
"July 7 we (2 adults and 2 children 5,10 years) go for dinner at Aradi."
"The hostess (I presume) dressed differently from rest of staff takes our orders, and speaks fluent english."
"I specifically ask for fried fish with no skin and bones, which she guaranteed."
My friend orders a t-bone steak.
Both the children got spaghetti bolognese.
"The food arrives and I get a whole platefull of bones and skin in different sizes and shapes, my friend's t-bone is smoked and pink just like bacon."
"The staff could see we were not going to eat and tried to take our plates, we said no and asked several times to speak with the hostess that had taken our order, when she finally had the time to speak with us, she could unfortunatley only speak spanish."
"No compensation or compromise, but only a bill of EUR 105."
"Nice, good, and very nice people there."
"Go, let them recommend what to eat, and just enjoy!"
"Decent Pinxtos, but not as much choice as you'd get in San Sebastian or so."
Very busy.
Good location.
Can be expensive if you're hungry...
We came upon this in an alley of the center of town (go to Plaza Joan Carles I to corner of San jaime) and what a gem!
"Contemporary decor and atmosphere, mix of the fashionable locals and tourists."
People were dressed tastefully and expensively casual as only Europeans can.
"The food is amazing, try the small plates/appetizers and then maybe share an entree or two."
"We loved the blood sausage rolls, out of this world!"
even if you don't think you'll like it--try it especially if you're a fan of vinegar.
"The black pudding ravioli melts in your mouth, the grilled baby lamb was just right and the octopus carpachhio and fried squid were enjoyable as well."
The wine list is quite impressive and the cocktail menu uses fine liquors.
"This is a must and not badly priced for the quality of ingredients, I think we spent ~$100USD for two of us for four starters, shared entree and cocktails."

My husband and I had been to this restaurant a few times over the past 6 six years and always had a good meal.
"Last night however, we decided we would never go back."
"The location is wonderful and worth a walk around but don't bother eating there - it started on a bad note with no toilet paper or hand dryer in the ladies and went on to disappoint with the starters - I had smoked cod with antipasti which dare I say it, probably came from a jar.... my husbands starter was a pear and feta cheese salad with no dressing and for some strange reason was sprinkled with brown sugar - very bland."
"I was not drinking so my husband ordered a glass of wine - we then found out this was 6 euros, ok for one glass you might think but they charge a further 6 euros to pour it in a glass and bring it over!!!!"
In a luxurious hotel they may get away with this type of service however when you are sitting in a restaurant with plastic outside tables and paper napkins I'm sorry but this is just nonsensical!
"Our main course then arrived - we had the paella with lobster and monkfish, at 25 euro per person we thought this should be quite a good one."
"Sadly, once again our expectations were shattered - the rice was oversalted, the monkifish was scarse and the lobster barely cooked."
Now I like tender none-chewy shellfish and have enjoyed these type of dishes all over the world but this was just BAD.
My husband and I are now paying the price of bad food this morning..... need I say anymore.
Modern boutiquey restaurant split over three levels serving tapas with a contemporary twist.
"We ordered a variety of tapas dishes: breaded prawns with parmesan sauce (fantastic, tasted nicer than it sounds); pimentos de padron (as they say, some are hot (spicy), others are not -- but these were fortunately not); mini pizzas of sobrasada sausage, with menorcan cheese on a base of mini ensaimada (mallorcan croissant), which were good, if not fantastic, and for which you'd have to give a 10/10 for imagination."
"The modern twist on the Spanish favourite of ensalada rusa (tuna, onion, mayo, onion and pea salad) was very good and fresh and nothing like the creamy gunk that ensalada rusa nearly always implies."
try to get a seat on the terrace as it has a great location .food price quality is good
"Great restaurant, amazing food."
"The terrace is beautiful, get a table there if you can (booking is a must)."
Inside is also lovely but more formal and subdued.
Don't be put off by the slightly stuck up hostess on the door - once you get in the service is very friendly!
"This restaurant is very different to La Boveda it is small, and rustic, not as open and bright as the previous."
The staff are great with children and the food is great.
Would definatly go again.
"This was originally a bar catering for the local fisherman and the only food available was freshly caught and cooked sardines, washed down with local rustic red wine."
"Those days have now gone and the second generation of the family has now expanded and developed Sa Barca into a restaurant with large seating area in the alley leading to the beach,together with two indoor rooms."
"Comprehensive light menu at lunch and a good menu dia at €12 in the evening together with a decent a la carte , including South American cuts of meat introduced by the son in law of the family , originally from Uruguay , now developing the business."
"A nice place to sit outside on a warm evening , service is friendly and food quality generally good."
However it would be lovely to turn back the clock!
"This restaurant is the last of a row of six on the Mar Menuda Promenade very popular at lunch times , especially with the locals."
It was quite busy when we arrived at 8pm on a May evening and we were made very welcome and chose an outside table with views of the sunset over the main beach and castle.
"Mixed diners - we heard French , Catalan ,Spanish ,Russian ,Dutch and even Chinese!"
Started with a good pan tostados followed by lubina plancha for me a very good fillet steak.. Lovely selection of vegetables and everything well presented and cooked.
Bill including two postres (inc the ubiquitous crema catalan ) wine and water = €50 Great value.
"Returned in June - quite quiet but got an inside window seat,still with view of the beach."
"Pan tostados,Filette Pimieta,Lubina Plancha.Vino Rosado de la casa,beer and pud came to €46 again very good value My wife usually likes her fish intact but the seabass was so large she had it off the bone - wonderful value at €12.50 , how do they do it - it would be circa €20 elsewhere."
"A very pleasant evening , lovely food , we will return."
.
The menu looks more promising than it tastes.
Just tucked away behind the Plaza Mayor is this fabulous restaurant.
The cuisine is Modern Spanish - using traditional Spanish ingredients to produce excellent modern dishes.
My party sampled a good number of the especialidades and I could not pick my favourite as each one was truly delicious.
Very reasonably priced too.
"Great food, great wine and great service."
Recommended!
"A very pleasant meal, the best of 3 meals we had in Fuengirola, the staff were friendly and efficient."
the night we were there 90% of the tables were taken and all the meals looked nice.
A lot of other restaurants were well below capacity
Just got back from Akelarre where my wife and I each tried one of the seven course menus..... (1) ambiance - terrible.
No music and the restaurant is completely devoid of any decor.
"If you're looking for a restaurant where you can sit back, relax and enjoy a bottle of wine a few laughs with your companion, this is not the place."
Your typical McDonald's has had more thought put into its general decor than Akelarre.
"There are a few tables that have wonderful views of the sea, but unless you're lucky enough to be seated by a window or make your reservation days in advance, you will have a wonderful view of beige colored wallpaper with no decorations."
(2) Service - The service is nothing short of what you would expect at a world class restaurant...no complaints.
"(3) Food - It is readily apparent that the chef is a master at food presentation; however, so much time and effort is spent on presentation that the taste is somehow forgotten."
"The deserts were remarkable but the preludes were just like a work of fine art.....they are meant for looking, not touching."
"It's not that the dishes are prepared from the finest ingredients (I'm sure they are), or that the combinations of ingredients are'nt complementary (they are), the problem is that each dish is so elaborate, so complicated, that it is impossible to actually enjoy the taste of the food."
"(4) Price - 300 euros for 2 people, no wine."
Not a steal of a deal in any event.
"Overall, if you're looking to discover exactly how complicated food can be, Akelarre is a good choice."
"If you're looking for a restaurant that provides good food and the opportunity for a memorable experience, skip it and try one of San Sebastian's many other options."
The initial quirky decor was appealing.
We sat in a room at the back.
We shared a tasting menu which we were informed comprised of a selection of tostas and some seafood.
The tostas were mediocre and some of them were stale.
"The seafood was a joke - a small tin (like a sardine tin) of mussels, a small tin of squid and another small tin (the content of which slips my mind)."
"They hadn't even put the contents onto a plate or dish, just ripped the lids off."
When the bill arrived we were gobsmacked - each tin was charged at between €10 and €14.
The bill for three of us for extremely mediocre food was extortionate even by Madrid standards.
They must have seen us coming.
"So, I saw this place a couple of weeks ago and the menu seemed cool and eclectic so decided to try it out."
"Went yesterday for lunch, and I have to say it was a letdown for me."
"The decor looks nice from the outside - once you step inside, they could have used a little bit of ""less is more"" especially when it comes to the use of red and mirrors: from some angles you get some sort of funhouse effect."
"The service was poor, but then again I am getting kinda used to that in low to mid-price restaurants in Madrid - friendliness not being their strong suit."
But the main issue here was the food.
"Each dish came out within about 2 minutes from ordering, which spells reheat in every restaurant book."
"I had one of their daily specials for the appetizer - a small tartine with veggies and goat cheese, which was alright but got mangled by not just one, but two types of pesto loaded on as criss-cross decoration."
"Again: less is more, guys."
Then I ordered the milhojas of lamb - the lamb was tender but overcooked and totally microwaved and covered in a mustard sauce with no complexity or nuance whatsoever that didn't really let me taste either the lamb or the potatoes.
But the worse was to come for dessert - I ordered their chocolate mousse.
How do you mess up chocolate mousse?
"Well, for one, by serving it in probably the most unfortunate presentation I've EVER seen in any restaurant: on a dinner plate - as a splat taking half the plate with some crushed yellow cookies on the other half."
The overall visual effect: cow dung on hay.
"Once I got past my squeamishness, the mousse was just alright, but overpowering (very dark chocolate, with nothing to play against) and I couldn't finish it."
Anyone who knows me knows I don't usually send chocolate back anywhere.
This was a first.
All in all - I won't be coming back.
Really there's a lot of other choices in Madrid that are more satisfying.
"The prices were enticing, but really the overall experience didn't live up to my expectations."
It took a long time (5 years of visiting Mallorca) to find a restaurant as good as this in the old town of Pollenca.
The location is to the south of the main square in a discrete looking building (not far from a convenient taxi halt ).
"Inside, the building appears to be a blend of spanish colonial with classic touches."
It is from a bygone and much missed age.
Ceiling fans rotate overhead as busy and friendly staff circulate below.
"Look out for the charismatic Louis, or consult with the owner Jaquim if you want to enhance your experience of the meal."
All fish is fresh from the market- you can say hello to your lobster if you are of that disposition.
On the whole the dining is excellent based on the quality of produce used.
"I recommend the large prawns or crayfish ( when available ) ,but a particular favourite is the grilled john dory."
The leg of lamb is unbelievably soft..
"Finish off with the baked sour apple (caramalised), and if feeling indulgent the fig and biscuit ice cream."
If you visit this part of Mallorca- eat local style (rather than eat italian as some seem to do in the centre of this town?
).
"One of the best kebab places in Barcelona, it stands out among the (abundant) competition"
Good Shawarma Excellent baklavas
This friendly restaurant is in one of the little cobbled streets of Old Altea.It has inside and outside dining in a relaxed atmosphere with charming and attentive staff.The fillet steak (which I think they call sirloin on the menu)is some of the best I have tasted.The fish too is excellant -- although for me I always ask for either no sauce or the sauce separately as otherwise it does come with a sauce overload !
The fish is so wonderfully fresh and cooked pefectly that a sauce is really not needed.The pizzas and pasta are also great and very reasonable.I think they also do a take out service.
Most of the puddings are home made and the flan de cafe and the chocolate cake are far too good !!
The portions are generous and the price very reasonable.It is a restaurant that appears to enjoy children and even with a pushchair in tow all are made so welcome.
It's not Gordon Ramsey cooking but it is very well worth a visit and everyone I have spoken to returns again and again so that is as good an advert as possible.
It is advisable to book unless you go early evening as later on it is packed
Overpriced and way too appreciated for what it really was.
We read from various reviews that it should be one of the best tapas places in Madrid - which is TOTALLY wrong.
"The food was not exactly tapas but bigger rations, the food was average and part of it not even that."
We have eaten so much better tapas elsewhere (where locals go) and for less of a price.
"Do not choose this, when we had been there for a while we realized that there were only tourists like us and no local people, always a sign of a not-so-good food... We paid around 90€ for a meal for two persons and it was NOT worth it."
"Situated on the front near the Castle between the Capri and Cap D`Or this long established restaurant is very busy with lunchtime visitors but easier to get a decent table at night but , like others on the front , can be quiet out of season Staff have been here for some years and service is cheerful and efficient."
"Occasionally you glimpse the owner who we think , because of his looks and the picture of Tito on the wall , could have originated in old Yugoslavia."
"The inside restaurant is long and narrow with about eight tables (nicely decorated with candles) but for a long lunch , or on a warm evening,the large open area (protected by velum) is the place to sit."
"Menu is typical of Tossa (Paella ,Zarzuala ,Lomo etc) but has some interesting dishes and decent pizzas."
Ate twice there this year and had same choice - firstly a starter of pan tostados followed by roast chicken with roasted vegetables and a very interesting pizza special - chicken and sultanas.
"House red ,beer and two puds came to €42.90."
On our list.
Food is below average.
Got terrible loin-steaks.
"No vegetables (could order for Euro 14,50 extra...) and no potatoes."
"Starter ""Gambas ajillo"" were ok, but to charge 23 Euro for it is insane, when a more reasonable and common price for this kind of starter elsewhere in Spain is about 8 Euro."
"Terrible service when we asked for ""extras"" as olive oil, vinegar, potatoes etc."
Never again!
"After reading the previous review, we really had to give this restaurant a try."
It was somewhat difficult to find however a local gentleman kindly helped.
"We made a booking on the day, however we also left it until our final evening."
A big mistake!
We had such a lovely evening and should definitely have left time to repeat the experience!
"A warm welcome, attentive service and food far superior to most other restaurants in the locality made for a lovely evening."
The set menu gave a wide choice and proved excellent value.
Every dish was cooked perfectly and was both fresh and flavoursome.
We tend to visit Calpe once every couple or years and will certainly be back again.
Highly recommended and definitely not to be missed!
"Just looking to it you are afraid because the location (in the main square of Santiago, just in front of the Cathedral in the basement of the Hostal de los Reyes Católicos)."
"You enter through a small door and you find this typical ""meson"" from Galicia."
Here you can eat any kind of fresh fish and seafood together with a white Galician wine.
It is not expensive if you look to the exceptional location and quality!
!
nice food for friendly prices.
and never forget to have one of their desserts - that's the best part!
":) love the atmosphere, though service could be better and more friendly.."
"a group of four women friends on holiday in Mar de Cristal headed for Torrevieja for an evening out.One was a vegetarian and we happened upon this place, didn't look much from the outside,but wow what a fantastic menu even for non veggies."
"The choice of starters was unusual beetroot tsatski and other dippie things, my main course was a blackbean burger with mushroom and parmesan with potato wedges and ali oli dip."
"The puddings were a treat worth going just for that, i had sticky toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce,my friend had a passionfruit sponge with lemon and bluberries this too was delicious."
A bit more expensive than other places but well worth a visit
The best chocolates in Barcelona.
Wonderful restaurant in the Aiguaclara hotel.
The real name is the AGORA... see the related review.
This is a business restuarant by day but if you can get table it is worth it.
It is reasonably priced.
Wine list is extensive and again reasonably priced.
"The owner, Pedro, is an extremely nice guy."
I recommend the Steak in pepper sauce or the fish especially the plaice or the hake throat.
The best thing on the menu (and why the restaurant is famous) is for the steak you cook yourself on a hot stone.
"Starters include mushrooms with cured ham, Jamon Serrano of course and asparagos."
Everytime I go to Madrid I try to make it to Don Pedro.
It is near the airport on the road to Zaragoza and out of the way but well worth the trip for those of you who love their food.
A serendipitous encounter whilst strolling the streets of scorching historic Seville at 11 at night.
Numerous people chatting and laughing; a corner terrace with a beautiful waitress smiling at us.
"A refreshing chilled beer, followed by a langoustine carpaccio and a lomo de cerdo (medium rare pork fillet), barbecued in a sukiyaki sauce."
Delicious and filling enough for a late evening tapa.
I will be back for more next time.
On a warm balmy evening sitting in the square watching the comings and goings of the locals we enjoyed an excellent italian meal.
Especially noteworthy desserts - creme brulee and pannacotta.
Service was efficient and friendly.
It was so good we even decided to return for the final meal of our week long stay.
We recommended it to family who also had a positive dining experience with children well accommodated and we plan to revisit on our next trip.
We liked this place so much we came back twice during our stay in Seville.
"Excellent, friendly service, a very casual and relaxed atmosphere and great prices make this a very nice place for a meal, when you just want a good meal and good time, without all the fuss."
"Special requests on the pizzas are no problem, and all pastas and antipasti were very good."
"Their fruit salads with yoghurt and müsli are a must - filled with strawberries, watermelon, banana and topped off with cocoa, cinnemon and honey - yummie!!"
!
Great wee family run restaurant with sister restaurant next door.
Good food at affordable prices.
the tapas were left out until 1.30 am in room temperature.
the raw fish was next to the cooked fish and you could see the bacteria grow.
Ciutat Comtal was the highlight of my visit to Barcelona!
"We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated, and were served immediately."
"The tapas dishes that we ordered, all of which was simply divine, was fresh, tasty and of exceptional quality."
We enjoyed every single bite!
Ciutat Comtal also has a wide selection of beers.
Recommended Dishes: -Patatas Bravas (cubes of fried potatoes with mayonnaise and chile sauce) -Shrimp skewers and grilled tenderloin on baguette slices -Puntillas (sp?)
(fried tiny squid) -Roasted pepper stuffed with sole puree -Crema Catalan
"Looks like a designer fusion restaurant, tastes like a slightly expensive and mediocre sushi restaurant."
"Didn't stay at the hotel but booked for Sunday lunch - first impressions are fantastic as the grounds are absolutely stunning, but once we sat down for lunch the problems quickly presented themselves: staff were amiable but not nearly professional enough for the surroundings (and price), seeming somewhat confused about the menu (which is so short there should be no trouble whatsoever)."
"There is no a-la-carte menu, only the three-course €30 option, which would be fine if it was somewhat more accomplished, but choices were pedestrian and portions surprisingly small."
Inexcusable is the fact that the first course is a salad buffet consisting of choices little more competent than a fast-food outlet salad bar.
"Even more incompetent was the dessert course, with a pana cotta that was set with so much gelatine it was merely a piece of rubber with some fruit topping."
"The staff, to their credit, asked if there was a problem with the dessert, and when told why it was inedible looked rather resigned to the fact that this is a regular occurrence."
In addition to our disappointment there was a table of four sitting next to us (who were staying at the hotel) who also complained about their meals and seemed to imply too that this was a regular occurrence.
"So I can't vouch for the rooms, but based on Sunday lunch I'd have serious reservations about giving this hotel any of my money - which is a shame for such beautiful surroundings, but if they can't create and manage a simple lunch menu then I can imagine that other negative comments on this site are justified."
We were lucky to have stumbled upon this restaurant at lunchtime.
For this level of food and service we would normally expect to pay a lot more.
"Nice ambience, too, and not crowded at all."
Highly recommended.
nice place..........!!!!!
!
Great traditional menu del dia.
"I had the best conejo ever, and there was too much salad and vegetables (a rare treat here) plus two bottles of wine - one of us wanted red, one white."
Great service too.
"Las Albarizas is a family run resturant, with a superb menu range all cooked fresh on the premises."
"You are made to feel one of the family at the Las Albarizas which is in the middle of the old fishing village of La Carihuela, Torremolinos."
One visit is not enough to this delightful restuarant 10 out of 10
Four of us arrived at around 20:00 on a Sunday evening and had to wait 20 minutes for a table - which wasn't a problem.
"Then discovered a huge beer menu, including half a dozen Belgian brews, which made the wait even better."
The seating area towards the rear is very comfortable and a much better environment for the uninitiated to wade through the comprehensive menu.
"Swift, if not rather brusque service and excellent food."
Four of us ate and drank (plenty!)
for well under 100 Euro.
We left around 21:30 by which time the front bar area was heaving.
I hate to think how long you would wait for a table then!
Highly recommended.
"""Tapas"" and beer."
A place to go one day
What can I say!
Everything was perfect.
"This place is so popular with the locals expect to queue, we did and it was well worth it.."
"I really fancied a paella, there was a choice of fish, or fish and meat."
I'm not too keen on fish so asked the waiter if just a meat paella would be ok.
He said no problem!
"It was for a minimum of 2 people, but as no one else wanted meat paella I had it to my self!"
The price was so cheap I could afford to!
WOW!!
The BEST paella I have ever had.
Big chunks of meat and sausage.
Yum.
"The sangria was excellent, as was the chocolate dessert."
"So cheap, friendly, just great."
Def go back again.
"Great service,great food 10/10."
Had dinner here twice and both meals were fantastic.Best pork i have ever tasted and a sirlion steak to die for with a fantastic house sauce.
"Not really for veggies but meat lovers, get your bum on a seat there,worth the trip to spain alone."
Um!!!!
!
This place was a delight.
The anchovy bread with red peppers was gorgeous and the cod in green sauce lovely.
"The service was as friendly as can be and the location beautiful; right next to the Donana, with pelicans and herons in view."
"The town of El Rocio is an amazing place anyway (very wild west, with horse drawn carts and sandy streets) but this restaurant made it amazing."
"We went for 3 nights on the trot and if I were ever in the area again, would DEFINITELY return."
I will dream of that anchovy dish!
"we visit barcelona 3 or 4 times a year with friends, can never fault any selection should be in a good food guide for the quality and selection friendly atmosphere,to boot, fantastic."
"i looked through the list on traveladvisor,restaurants, its is not even mentioned."
within a stones throw of segrada familiar!
"I don´t know who has written all these reviews, but I wasn´t that impressed with the restaurant."
Firstly it is hard to find.
"If you are in a taxi it may be easier, but if you are driving or taking the metro it is a bit of a search."
The plaza where the restaurant is located is beautiful and that was probably the best thing about the place.
We went in July and the place was quite touristy - but so were we !!!!
I reckon not too many locals go in the summer.
The food was nothing special.
"Well coming from India where is fish is sooooo tasty, Spanish fish just didn´t do it for me."
The wine list was extensive and well the company was great.
But the place just didn´t hit the spot for the price that we paid for the food.
This restaurant is by far the best in Cala n Bosch.
As a family with young children (aged 7 and 4) we were looking for somewhere which catered for all tastes but didn’t go down the chicken nuggets and fish fingers route.
Here you will get fresh meats/fish and veggies all for a reasonable price.
The food was cooked to perfection and the fact that we went 6 times out of 14 nights says it all.
"A meal for four : 2 steaks, 2 spag bols, a bottle of rioja , kids drinks and ice cream cost 50 Euro."
Highly recommend that you eat here.
i thought the Burger King in Ibiza Town was really good too.
Friendly service and willingness to give away free headgear at 3 in the morning was an unexpected bonus.
I definately will be returning next trip to Ibiza!
"unlike the KFC in ibiza, this tastes exactly like english burger king."
it was a great relief to have something that tasted normal.
"also, as you may or may not know all other burgers in ibiza are disgusting, all made from gristle and taste peppery and unlike normal burgers."
"i definitely recommend this as a nice place to eat, if u like burger king in england."
Obviously a local fish restaurant favoured by the Spanish people.
There is a comprehensive fish menu as well as a delicious looking peppered steak which was carried past our table.
"there was a quartet of local canarian folk singers, serenading us at the table."
"The starters were particularly good value, especially mussels fisherman style."
"Absolutely no doubt had we found this the first night, we would have gone for the next five."
Taxi fare from Adeje was about 5 euros between four of us.
Along with 2 friends we were on a week end trip to Madrid from the UK.
Having eaten in T Rs in the states on more than one occasion we hoped this would be a good choice for dinner.
"It was not a good experiance, we were set down in the rear of the resturant next to the kitchen door, the heat was terrific no Air Con so we felt very down before the food was delivered."
"The food when it came was very poor, my burger was almost raw!"
the bread wet!
no sign it had been toasted and the fries were cold and like rubber.
"The other meals were of a poor standard, my friend had a club sandwich again the bread was very wet the fries cold."
We did not complain as we needed to exit from the heat a.s.a.p.
We would not reccomend this place to any one.
John Marie Jim & Sue
"OK, you read the reviews you visit the places to eat on this street."
The prices are sky high I mean astronomical!
The food is OK.
"If you order food by weight, i.e."
crab or lobster be sure to know the weight before you buy.
They should show you first but don't.
I got stung for 65 euros for a crab that you can buy in the market for 5.
The service was pestering to get in business.
"I wouldn't go near there again, very poor."
"Yes, the food is very good - but the name of the place is Al Fresco."
"Only a little different, I know, but if a place was that good I'd certainly remember it's name!"
Excellent.
A nice place.
"Good wines, good meats."
"Expensive, but you get the best for the price you pay."
My wife and I attended a wedding reception at the Palacio.
The service from the time the guests arrived until we finished at 5 am was impeccable.
The menu was atypical of American wedding menu's.
Everything was delicious!
The views from the balcony around the building are stunning but a bit breezy.
The Palacio is stone but completely modernized and about 20 minutes outside Pamplona.
"Maybe one should not order Japanese food in Barcelona, but if you do avoid UDON."
"Despite its slick interior, this chain restaurant could not hold it together."
"The place was relatively crowded, but only had two waitresses."
The trouble began when our waitress tried to seat our party of five at a long table with benches bolted into the floor.
"Because of the configuration, four of our party were seated comfortably while the other was initially obliged to sit on another bench where a party of three people were already sitting."
"The dislocation would have been easily solved had we been able to move a chair to our part of the table, the chairs were immoveable."
We ordered appetizers and two main courses hoping to share them.
Our drinks came to our table promptly.
"However, no tea came with the tea cup until the end of the meal, and not without us prompting the waitress."
"Oly one of the five appetizers, the Gyoza, arrived at the table first and the balance came only after we completed our entrees."
After a considerable period of time the two main courses arrived.
After some time our waitress brought one order of miso soup.
"As no spoon arrived, the member of our party who ordered it figured that it must be eaten Japanese style."
When he was finished the waitress arrived with an oversized wooden ladle and placed it on the table in front of the now devoured soup bowl.
Realizing this was not going to be enough food for us we ordered three more main courses.
They were no better than what could be purchased at supermarket from a box.
"As for the appetizers, and with respect to the shrimp tempura, after finding one shrimp, the balance was shredded batter and some broccoli and carrots dripping in oil."
It was the lamest tempura I have ever tasted.
"Nice location, long queues, good value, mediocre food."
Simply and tastefully decorated.
"You won't get gourmet cooking here but for the price, you're better off here than the other run of the mill places along la rambla."
"Good place to try out Spanish dishes if you're on a budget, new to it, not very adventurous or not sure if you like it."
"We had a calamari appetizer and a squid ink pasta, both pleasantly palatable."
"I haven't actually eaten here, just frequented the party scene."
"It's got a lot of room, and great band/DJs."
It's not the typical European club scene -- there is more room and light.
It does get crowded but you can usually find a table outside if you need air or a breather.
It's a great location and they can serve up the kalimotxos!
I endorse the recommendation for Vinoleto.It's a friendly tapas bar with good quality .
"""modern"" tapas such as goats cheese with mango.A free tapa comes with each drink,but you can also order from a quite large menu.Order a selection and you might not want dinner."
A good mixture of Spanish people and other nationalities unlike some of the other Nerja bars.There is also a very good selection of wines by the glass and bottle.
"Great location- but close to where the ferries dock each day, and coaches pass near by- so forget a quiet lunch here.!"
This part of Mallorca is picture perfect.
Ironically you can also chose from a menu showing pictures of what you are about to eat.
Not a great sign for a classic dining experience.
"The food is average, verging on the disappointing."
The greatest let down was the expensive lobster stew.
Many people do compliment the restaurant for its varied choice.
"However one ""curried"" fish dish reminded me of the types of weak vesta curries we had in the UK during the 1970's."
It caters for large numbers during summer evenings and it shows.
It lacks a certain spark which could elevate this restaurant into a different class.
"If you want to have a relaxing and enjoyable place to have a drink, then don't go to Moo bar in Hotel Omm."
"I have tried to give it a chance serval times because it's a ""cool"" place to go, but every time I leave, I say ""I am never going back"" but never had an alternative close by."
It's all because their head waiter doesn't know the meaning of service and it affects the whole atmosphere in the place.
I would never write this review if it was based on a 1-time experience; however I live here and have had the same experience many times.
So now they have some competition right around the corner so I would recommend to go Mur Muri -- great customer service and just as cool envinronment.
http://www.murmuri.com.
Cannot recommend this place more.
Everything from start to finish was fantastic.
I've eaten in a number of Michelin Star restaurants but this tops the list.
"The Red Mullet was the best dish I've ever been served, simple yet bursting with taste!"
The service was top notch and I had the accompanying wines with each course which were fantastic.
The main courses are half portions so they recommend you order two plus a starter.
However the food was so good we ordered another main course.
"Bill came to just over 200 euro for two which, although somewhat pricey, was considearbly cheaper than many similar type restaurants."
Definitly worth splashing out on.
We visited this restaurant in September 2007 based on local reputation and the odd review (Vinos y restaurantes).
"At that time the food was good, but the ambience slightly staid and lacking something special."
"This year in June we found the restaurant had apparently changed hands, and the (mainly) older staff had been replaced by a younger generation."
Uniforms have evolved from plain jackets to bright red shirts.
"The cuisine is equally as bright, and on the whole reasonable in price and quality."
"On our visit we avoided the inexpensive ""menu of the day"" which although appearing wholesome did not suggest great things."
The a la carte menu was interesting-and from this we both selected an excellent feta and green salad starter with roasted aubergine.
My wife had a colourful main dish of spiced chicken stuffed with apricots whilst I had a very good (albeit square shaped) section of local suckling pig.
The vegetables included purple potato chips and a ragu of vegetables.
The slightly over presentation of ingredients did not detract from what appears to be a reliable kitchen.
"We had a very drinkable Mortix Rosado, with a half bottle Rioja reserva.The wine list appears to be more than adequate."
"The a la carte selection including water, liquors, and coffee came to 45 euros each."
Iru suffers from a large number of competing restaurants situated both to the left and right of it.
"It is however worthy of a repeat visit- and whilst being just a little short of the very best, it deserves to be patronised by anyone looking for something more than full english breakfasts ,crepes, jacket potatos,pasta, and pizza."
In a nice two-floors ambience (with a long balcony overlooking the sea) the menu is very touristic and a little too tasty when we had the grilled fish filet.
must agree totally very overated
"A very overated restaurant, pricey, very limited menu, better value and better food elsewhere."
Very Overrated.
My partner and I had a long weekend away in Santa Ponsa and we ate in The Toad every day!
The food was lovely!
Especially the Irish Breakfasts!
The service was top notch and the staff were the friendliest people you could meet and couldn’t do enough for us.
All in all a cracking holiday!
Coming back next year!
"I was here in October 2006, service was great, and the steaks even better"
"This lovely restaurent in Montuiri, quite apart from the wonderful food, has an amazing 180 degree view across the cetre of Majorca."
It is slightly tricky to find but well worth seeking out.
I can't understand why it isn't packed out every night.
The owners are excellent hosts and the food fab.
"My partner, who never eats pork at home, had pork in masala and is still raving about it."
The a la carte prices are reasonable and they do a very reasonably priced 'menu del dia' which is very popular.
We shall certainly be eating there again on our next visit to Majorca
"Firstly I'll say that you are not allowed to take pictures in here, however after paying a lot for drinks, I took about 12!"
Abaco is out of this world.
"Along the back lanes of Palma de Mallorca, you will come across a hugh wooden door."
Go through the small door.
and enter a completely different world!
"Fresh fruit and veg everywhere, absolute extravagance, candles and even the Everton director of football Keith Bradshaw was present here!"
We went to the bar to look @ the cocktail menu and it said 15 Euros per cocktail.
We didn't know aht was in them so decided to have a Malibu & coke & a vodka fresh orange.
"The Malibu was served normal, however, the vodka fresh orange wasn't."
The fresh orange was put into a crystal jug so you could dilute the vodka as you chose.
"This wasn't just concentrated orange juice out of a carton, it was freshly squeezed and you could tell as soon as it hit your tongue."
Unfortunately both drinks cost 15 Euros (£12 GBP) each so would have been better going for the cocktails.
It was an experience I'll never forget.
There is a courtyard inside and museum upstairs.
"Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
"Small, dirty-looking, there's nothing to sit on... but still, the best squid sandwiches in town, without any doubt."
"""El secreto está en la salsa"":-)"
The paella - you HAVE to try it.
"Head for the `placa` in the centre of tiny ,but chi-chi Fornalutx -a pretty village a stones throw from Soller ."
"Share a bottle of Vina Sol sitting in one of the local cafes and watch all life there, before heading for a stylish supper at the chic Cafe Med , a stroll away."
"Owned by a charming chatty English guy and his German wife-they are soon to open a pizzeria just up the hill as well..( sure this will go down a storm too),Cafe Med serves simple well-cooked ,fresh food with a great balance of flavours not overwhelmingly drizzled in too many sauces etc."
"We ate perfect ( and very large) scallops served with pancetta and rocket, shared a whole seabass-bliss..and tucked into vanilla cheesecake puddled with fresh -from -the -orange- grove -across- the- road orange syrup."
"It was all so great , we went back for more the second night."
Go!
"We were expecting a great deal from this place - it was the favourite restaurant of our hoteliers, and after dining here our fellow guests declined to spoil their memory of fine dining by going to Bens d'Avall."
"So we ordered a cab from Soller (the roads to Fornalutx do not merit driving sober, let alone after a glass or two of Cava) and made our way to the restaurant."
"The cab parked on the village square, (Café Med is located in a 400 year old stone house in the midst of the village's labyrinth of narrow cobbled streets in what purports to be the most beautiful village of Spain) and we walked to the far end of the road to take our seats outside this tiny establishment."
"The chairs were comfy, the staff were very helpful and friendly (with very good knowledge of their limited but exceptional wine list.)"
It is just a shame the kitchen let them down.
"While our salad starters were fine, the tomato risotto was, as my husband put it, like Campbell's tomato and rice soup."
"If we hadn't heard such great things about this restaurant, we may have liked it more (it certainly wasn't as bad as some others we visited) but I am glad we hadn't reserved this for our anniversary dinner, as apart from the lovely wine, it merely filled a hole."
Seafood wie sichs gehört.
"Service reagiert nicht auf Spanisch, besser auf Deutsch/Englisch bestellen"
This is a classic Barcelonian Restaurant.
Too many tables.
Noisy.
A quiet haven in a busy street.
Great lunch.
Excellent cooking in the Basque style and efficient friendly service.
Not the cheapest - 3 courses for 33 euros - but still good value.
"A beautiful T Bone Steak, its best to book a table as it becomes very popular in the evenings."
Camaleon (canas y tapas) good food at very good prices.
There is a choice of an English or a Tapas menu.
I would recommend you try the tapas especially Chicken Camaleon which is strips in breadcrumb coating very well seasoned and quite garlicky and Canarian potatoes with Mojo sauce (sauce is served separately for diping) Excellent warm bread too.
The English menu had something for everyone from cottage pie to fish and chips.
The fish batter would rival anyones.
"Friendly, helpful staff - a family from 'the Black country' in England, made you feel welcome."
An oasis of calm with a spanish cantina feel to it in the middle of a purpose built resort pandering to the 'Brit abroad' union jack's everywhere approach to marketing.
"Typical bill for two adults with 2 rounds of drinks, 4 or 5 tapas dishes and bread €25 - 30 very good value for money"
I spent 3 weeks with my boyfriend touring Spain and it was so expensive and so much of the food was not good ($15 for a wilted atun iceberg salad).
"Also, we both hate smoking and it seems like everyone from age 2-100 chain smokes in Spain."
We ate many meals outside or in the room.
We just happened across this place in Barcelona and saw the non smoking sign and went in for that reason...but it was SO good and the prices were decent and the portions were of good size.
We went back a total of 3 times!
"Between the food and service and non smoking, it was a sure bet for us."
Some of the best food we had in Spain.
"An original pintxo place in San Sebastian that lets you sample something other than the same old, same old you can start experiencing elsewhere."
"The dishes were small but very tasty and a little unusual, I had a mini paella style rice dish with clams and mint that was delicious."
"Also, to be recommended for the large blackboard behind the bar that lists all the wines they have with a price per glass."
I think its hard sometimes in Spanish bars to really sample drinks other than beer/house wine unless you speak good Spanish or the bartender is really helpful.
However here I was able to ask for recommendations to go with what I was eating and also just pick glasses at random or if there was a name I recognised.
Restaurante situado en el Estadio con vistas al campo.
La carne y el pescado es excelente.
"Pero no me termina de convencer, le falta algo"
Certainly not the restaurant to choose if you are in Madrid.
Last year we went to Puerta 57.
We were really looking forward having a meal here as we are keen Real Madrid supporters and we were sure that the restaurant was not going to disappoint us.
What was supposed to be a family day out became a nightmare.
The first surprised was the menu itself.
"Amongst the starters they had some fish dish called ""chanquetes"".These are very small baby fish (length around five cms and as thick as noodles) which are deep fried in the same way as you cook sprats."
This dish was very popular in southern Spain until the late 90's when fishing them became totally banned because they are just baby fish of different types and just one portion could well have over 200 hundred of these little creatures.
Having ordered a bottle of wine right at the start of our meal we did not experience a single sip until way into the second course.
The bottle was placed in our table straight after ordering it but despite four attempts of trying to get our waitress to open it eventually it was uncorked.
What was amazing and terribly rude was that at the same time I was trying to get our waitress to open the bottle she was clearing up the table beside after the previous customers left (no other people waiting as it was well over 4.00 pm).
Obviously we were not in her list of priorities!!
We ordered a seafood paella for our second course.
"This came up in a large ""paellera"" (special flat pan only use to cook this very traditional Spanish dish), which was showed to us and then it was taken away from our sight."
Our waitress came back with three plates with three tablespoons of rice in each of them which had two or three shrimps and some squid chopped very finely.
As we were still hungry we asked for some more as we though there would be plenty left but we were told we already had all !!!
"(normally the ""paellera"" will be left at the table from the time is served and all serving should be taking place in front of the customer as it did happen too my of the other tables of the restaurant which were having the same dish)."
"When I asked for an explanation the head of the waiters came who did all the talk gesticulating and moving his arms to the extend that my wife though that his hands had been less than 1 cm away of heating her face, then the metre came not willing to listen to us and just backing up their colleagues appalling behaviour."
After all these they were surprised why we did not have any afters!
!
"Immaculately clean, excellent wines, good simple food, high quality, comfortable surroundings, attentive service."
In the town centre.
closed Sunday evening
We waited in line for almost an hour to eat at the counter and it was worth it.
"You can get drinks while you wait, which makes the time pass more quickly."
"Our server offered to get us a sampling of recommendations, as I couldn't understand a word of the menu."
"What we got was absolutely delicious - little spanish peppers, a mixed frite plate with wonderful seafood, some kind of seafood with garbanzo beans, tallerines (wonderful) and the spanish omelete."
"It was the best meal we had in Barcelona and a fun, unique experience."
Good tapas!
a real local place!
You have to get there early.
Sit at the bar.
"Let them give you the freshest sea food, vegetables, bread that you can imagine."
It a fantastic experience.
This restaurant is a REAL treat!
"They serve almost any seafood you could want, in typical Catalon style."
"The 2 gentleman in the picture I have uploaded speak english, and it is a real treat to watch the older gentleman practice the art of waiting tables!"
In addition the food cannot be beat!
"For a real surprise, ask the staff to choose for you."
"It will not be cheap, but everything I have eaten there has been worth every penny!"
Good tapas & wine bar.
"Hi, I was in this lovely restaurant in June 2008, and a had a very good time with wife."
"I was sleepping at the hotel and I booked for 2 nights; one of them we decided to have dinner there and sincerilly, it was a good idea."
I recomend this place.
The quality is perfect and the service too.
Terrible food.
"Ordered fish and got ...yes, A FISH with nothing else.No vegetables, no potatoes."
Terrible service and over-priced.
A very popular place!
It does get very busy but the tapas are fantastic.
We discovered La Boveda in January 2008 and made a trip into Palma in May 2008 just to go to this restaurant!!!
and will be going next year also!!
A definate must try.
I love La Boveda.
"Outside on the terrace you have views of the port and the yachts, inside it's hustle and bustel with the waiters and locals."
"We had: Potato omlette 2 Chorizo in red wine (best I've tasted) Red peppers sutffed with meat Gambas Al Ajillo (prawns with garlic and oil) Plate of cheese Plate of ham 2 deserts - Absolutely amazing, especially the Caramelo 2 bottles of house rose' wine bottle of water Came to 79 Euros."
Tip generously too as the waiters are very nice.
If you know a little Spanish too it goes down well :0)
"Excellent restaurant for very good, traditional tapas."
The cool seating area at the back of the restaurant was very welcoming during a very hot summer lunch time.
"Especially recommended are the Chorizo al vino, pimientos de Padrón and the good selection of wines (especially the good choice of citrusy white albariños)."
Had a very good filet of the house in the inner room (go over the bar).
Great list of local wines: you pay what you drink even from an unopened bottle.
If you're adventurous with your food then definitely try Abissinia!
"Tucked away in a little back street in Barcelona, this restaurant gives you a taster of the food, atmosphere, art and people of Ethiopia."
You sit on low wooden stools surrounded by traditional art work and materials and are served your dishes on a large metal platter.
"Large, light, fluffy pancake style breads are used to mop up your selected dishes that are on top of the platter."
Both meat eaters and vegetarians are catered for - try the set platters as these give you a selection of everything.
Make sure your hands are clean before you start eating as your fingers act as your knife and fork!
"Mostly dishes are slow cooked and fairly spicy and include basics such as lentils, vegetables, beef and chicken."
"Try the tea too, as this is a great palate cleanser!"
Certainly an experience for people who enjoy trying flavours from around the world.
"The Scotts Wirral Merseyside July 2nd 2008 We have just returned from Cala Dor, we ate at the Acuarius for my daughters 30th birthday."
"The table was booked by a friend on the internet, it was outdoors, champagne had been ordered also."
"The waiters were friendly and helpful, we all had something different from the menu and all enjoyed our meals."
The land train running along the road was no problem at all in fact my 4 year old granddaughter loved it.
I would recommend this restaurant it was very popular and always busy but we found that was not a problem.
I have to agree with the previous reviewer re El Churrasco.
Our food was so disappointing that I can´t even remember what we had - unusual for me!
The restaurant itself is unusual and interesting - as was the tour we had of their wine cellar.
Go here if you must but have minimal expectations - that way you might think it´s OK.
There are much better places to try in Cordoba.
"If you just want a stop-over near Madrid, without wanting to break the bank and fancy good food in a very modern restaurant in a B&B-style hotel...then try El Pontifical near the hill-top church in the ok village of Los Santos de la Humosa 30km from the Airport not far from the splendid University town of Alcala de Henares 3 small-ish/1 large bedrooms...very modern...and beautifully designed The bar area is equally modern and very eye-catching ... Only been open 9 months... Charming local owner (her English was better than ours!!)"
lives over the road...
It's a lovely stop-over place.....
"we were recomended the restaurant by our hotel as we did not know where to go.the experience was great from start to finish ,very good service and delicous food,will recomend Con gracia"
"Went to Colon in June/July 2008 and had an outstanding meal, with wonderful service from the staff, who were in the main German/Austrian but with good English and an even better work ethic."
"Nothing was too much trouble, the smiles were genuine and they hit the perfect level of being attentive without overdoing it."
"The food was superb; we started with langoustine (huge) and lobster bisque, followed by angler fish and turbot, all fresh and top quality ingredients prepared and cooked to perfection."
"Other little touches abound, from the excellent Bellini to start with to the bread served with individual dishes of oil, salt and chopped tomato/garlic mix (which were refilled without asking) and the appetizer taster dish served before the starter."
"You'll gulp a bit at the bill - around €170 for two including a decent bottle of wine - but the overall experience was so good we had a few cheap days and went again towards the end of our holiday, when it was every bit as good, with the addition of a chocolate fondant dessert which was indescribable!"
Treat yourselves and go to this wonderful restaurant!
We went to this restaurant because it was recommended in a guidebook.
This was a mistake.
The restaurant is very over-rated.
"Very expensive, average food."
Tiny portions.
Horrible service.
"We got seated, then ignored."
"Items that we requested did not show up, then items we did not order were added to the bill."
The waiter wanted to argue when I pointed out this bill problem but finally admitted he was wrong.
We paid and got out as soon as we could.
In general I have found in Barcelona (one of my favorite cities in the world) that the lower the price for food the better it is.
My husband and I with our 18 year old Son who has autism went to the Gran Canaria for one week.
5-12 July.
We stayed in the Morosal Suite in Puerto Rico which was very nice.
This is the first time we went to Gran Canaria as we normally go to Lanzorate/mainland Spain.
My Son is very bright and is intelligent but his has special needs which can be noticable.
I gave him €50 which would last him 2 days.
"He  is a child with routine and went to El Pescador 11, Puerto Rico to get a pepperoni pizza (he only eats pepperoni every day)However, when it came to paying the pizza he only received CHANGE OF €10.00 In other words he was short changed €40.00 I know in my heart  and soul that he had €50 (he pointed it out to the person at the till and he said no you gave me €10.00) My Son saw him putting in the €50 but got no law what so ever."
He was very upset over it.
I went to the Restaurant the following day and to say that they are ambassadors for tourism would disgust me.
"My Husband went into the restaurnt the next day and was verbally abused ,  in particular by one staff member ""to have the [--] beaten out of him"" (this person is a small fat chubby guy)The others were not much better."
I will certainly highlight this again in other websites to warn parents of  special needs/intellectual disability to steer clear of this restaurant as they are like vultures.
"I do not expect you to get back to me on this one, but, I will certainly warn some of the charities and media  not to let their children to be taken advantage of."
This happened on the night of the 7th July at 21.23.
"While we had a wonderful holiday, its does leave a lot to be desired when your child is taken advantage of like that and for staff to lie is sickening."
Siobhan O Rourke Parent of David.
"A pleasant enough restaurant, considering that in the Plaza Mayor, service and quality to 1000s of tourists is never going to be exceptional."
All the food came as ordered.
"The calamari was thick and the coating perhaps a little heavy, and the meats of Iberia varied and tasty."
A powerful wind suddenly came and the waiters rushed out to hold down the parasols - much appreciated.
"A good wine list, too."
A quiet location with a good mix of locals and touristas.
"The food was good to above average, and the location and atmosphere were above average."
"I thought the food was OK (Chicken skewers for me), and my wife thought the food was great (she had Salmon)."
The atmosphere and quietness (small side street) of the place make it nice.
Dinner cost us about $150US with a couple glasses of wine each.
We ate here on the recommendation of the hotel.
"Usually I am weary of hotel recommendations, but we liked the receptionist and took her recommendation."
It is in the heart of the city.
Pla was excellent.
"Modern, cool, excellent attentive service, nice house wine, great food, good deserts."
It was a winner on all fronts.
Recommend it any day !!
!
Had a few meals here while in Granada.
The Campo del Principe is a wonderful small square just off the beaten track of the city centre of Granada.
It is full of locals with children in the square every night it is very friendly.
The menu at the Toffe is simple but very nice and simple.
The staff are friendly and very helpful if you don't speak spanish.
Being a vegetarian anywhwere in Europe can be tricky.
Finding somewehre sepecial for an anniversary dinner therefore becomes an excessively difficult task.
"But this charming place delivers, as it offers an organic vegetarian tasting menu."
"At € 68 for 11 courses, I think it also delivers good value (you wouldn't get that in London!)"
especially considering the beautiful views of the Alconàsser coast between Deia and Soller.
"And it isn't too pretentious (there is no tutting from staff if you order a lager for an aperitif, or take photos of the stunning backdrop.)"
"Each course is carefully explained by the staff (who juggle giving detailed information in Spanish, Catalan, English and German to their international clientele)."
"The wine list isn't vast, but offers an array of Mallorcan, Spanish, European and new world wines, and the sommelier happily explains the properties of your choice, however low or high its price."
And the pace of service is spot on.
"Compared with the standard of food experienced at all other restaurants in the Soller area, I was amazed we secured a Friday-night, front of terrace reservation at a days' notice."
But I am very relieved we did.
And I only regret not having tried Benet Autentics in either Palma or Soller.
Fantastic fillet steak - the best I've ever had - shame about the restaurant management and attitude of the staff.
"After waiting 1½ hours for our meal, and after watching a couple and their 2 young children leave the restaurant after waiting for 2 hours and seeing our food arrive first (very embarrasing!)"
we queried why it had taken so long and where were the vegetables and chips to go with our meal.
"The waiter was most rude saying to my friend ""do you have a problem"", to which she replied ""no, it's you with the problem""."
"The vegetables never arrived although the chips did, but the atmostphere of the staff could be cut by a knife."
Staff were shouting and waving their arms around - maybe they just couldn't handle the volume of customers or maybe a member of staff had walked out and they were short staffed.
"Excuses are not good enough and you know what they say - ""if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen""!"
"On querying the bill (seems trivial but it was a matter of principle) and the non-appearance of the vegetables, the waiter insisted we'd eaten them and even brought out a dish of vegetables to show us what they looked like (I DO KNOW WHAT VEGETABLES LOOK LIKE!!)."
"At this point I lost my rag, paid my bill (less the amount for the vegetables) and left."
The only tip I left was a verbal one telling them how disgraceful their service had been.
"If you do't mind a long wait, enjoy confrontation and abuse being hurled at you from waiters - but want to enjoy the best steak in town, then go for it!!"
Good luck and bon appetite!
!
This was a place we just happened to walk past in Gracia - one of the more traditional local barrios of Barcelona.
"It looked like a dive, and well that´s why we took the chance and tried the place."
At first glance the prices of the food was not cheap.
But once the food came...wow.
Some of the best Spanish food I have tasted on my trip.
"In general the seafood was great, but so was the meat (said the people who tried it)."
The wines were quality names but at prices that were well below other restaurants (we were told).
The staff were friendly and we had a good good time.
"As I said, this is the real deal, the true catalan experience."
"Leave all the fancy over priced, modern contemporary cuisine that Barcelona is becoming known for and eat here."
Fantastic !!!
!
We went last year for the first time and we soon gave up trying other restaurants once we found this place.
We were 2 adults with a 5 and a 7 year old and we were treated like families should be.
"The family who runs Torre de Bahia is really friendly and the food is fresh and authentic, all that for a very reasonable price."
We even ordered paella to take away for a party and it was delicious.
I can't wait to go back next week and my kids are still talking about the food and the lovely lady who served us!
We wanted to have a special meal at the terrace at Can Nasi the last evening of our holiday in Begur.
It became a very bad experience.
"The waiter did a lot of mess with the wine and dishes, but the most annoying was that two hungry kids had to wait for a very long time to get their meals served."
"One of the children had ordered the pasta of the day, and the other had ordered french fries (not very advanced dishes)."
"After several questions for the food, the waiters started to overlook us."
It took us more than one hour to get a simple plate of french fries on the table.
"At that time, all the other guests in our company had finished their meals long time ago."
"When we asked for the bill, the restaurant had charged for two more dished than we had ordered."
"Can Nasi is not among the cheapest restaurants in Begur, and we expected that the service was good."
I regret to say that Can Nasi destroyed some of the very good impression we got of Begur during this holiday.
get the freshed seafood of the day and let it keep coming until you cant handle anymore.
"pick your fish and eat it two, the way you want it prepared."
"Serves local ""home cooking"" dishes."
"Cod in pil-pil sauce, and other cazuelitas (small dishes in clay pans)."
"Very authentic, and apparently frequented by locals."
We had to wait 10 minutes to get a table.
"I could tell the food was very well made, just not to my taste."
Tendido - next to Granada Bullring.
I went here with a group of 13 to experience a good spanish restaurant.
Being joined to the bullring I was expecting a very high quality of food.
"Oh dear these people were not experienced in food whatsoever, they would find boiling an egg a challenge."
"Here we go - I ordered an andalusian salad which they didn't have but said they could offer me a garden salad with tuna which I agreed to, anyway what I received was a barely cut up iceberg (yes it was an iceberg folks) with a tin of tuna dumped in the corner - I was charged nearly £10 for the honour too."
Andalusian salads are the finest in the world - this one however could have been beaten by a fast food restaurant with room to spare.
Steaks were raw when we ordered medium rare.
"Ducks ordered were almost alive as they were so under cooked - they were also cooked incorrectly - (skin on bottom not on top), about four meals were returned for further cooking and came back just as bad, so four people didn't eat at all."
One steak they had missed and when asked where it was they brought it out raw and then charged us for an extra steak not realising that it wasn't extra it was on the oringinal order.
"The timing of meals was all over the place, starters with mains, mains turning up too late and as mentioned before one main didn't come at all until prompted."
"We were over charged on one of the starters because it was charged as a main and not a starter, we told them several times that it was a starter."
When the bill came we mentioned this and they said they wouldn't reimburse the overcharge.
They paid us back for two of the meals but argued about the other unsatisfactory meals.
We got nothing back on these other meals.
Basically they provide poor food and service.
"- a very bad experience - This is a chain (like Harvester) not a single trader, therefore very bad at service and very good at yielding profit from selling rubbish food."
The best of the beach restaurants/bars this old established family run business is just to the left of Nautica Tossa and the line of boats on the beach.
"Freshly prepared snacks and meals ,full bar service and chilled wine and sangria is the order of the day."
"The bocadillos`,salads and tortillas are to be recommended and expect to pay €12 for a bocadillo a salad ,a beer and a couple of glass`s of vino, Can get busy at lunchtime,especially at weekends when the Spanish pop in for tapas before moving off for a late lunch, so grab a table under a brolly when you see one free,"
"My husband and I visited beautiful Valencia for our honeymoon, just after the Americas Cup."
"The waterfront area was booming and many restaurants could not seat us without reservations until 1 a.m. We continued up the strip of fancy, trendy restaurants and stumbled upon Neptuno."
"Its menu was fairly extensive, the ambiance was modest, but the service went above and beyond."
"Our server, Juan, was the nicest person."
"Just so warm, friendly and welcoming."
"He did a terrific job all night, humbled me by trying to understand my Spanish, and made my husband laugh throughout the evening."
"As we requested our check, he even sent over a bottle of champagne to us - the newlyweds - on his tab."
"Such a sweet, hardworking guy and such a delicious place."
I highly recommend it.
We found this restaruant to be the worst of all those that we sampled during our 2 week stay.
Here the staff were not very friendly and they allowed beggars to wander freely and pester diners as they were eating.
When it was borught to their attention that the beggars were becoming a nuisance the satff simply shrugged their shoulders instead of taking action.
We had roasted peppers and patatas bravas as a starter.
"The peppers were straight from a jar and the patatas bravas were simply deep firied frozen potatoes , not unlike the cheap ones you can buy in tescos at home."
the sauce was simply heated up tomato juice.
The main course of seafood paella simply tased of stock and salt and was maybe the worst paella i have ever had.This place is a typical overly expensive tourist trap and id advise anyone that may be tempted to try it not to.
"The staff do not serve you the food, they throw it at you.Look around the town and you will find many better places at half the cost."
Busy tapas bar.
Very popular with locals and tourists.
"Cheap, good location and good atmosphere."
"Unsophisticated, Friendly staff although one night one of them was incredibly rude to my girlfriend."
This is a German run restaurant with top quality food.
The French Onion soup is not to be missed.
The steaks are cooked to perfection and the Seafood cassarole is wonderful.
"It's not cheap, but well worth a meal out during your stay at Calpe."
"staying just down the road from Bobbys made it an ideal location for breakfast, lunch or our evening meal."
The food is all cooked fresh when you order it and the prices are really reasonable.
English breakfast from 3.95 with loads of other varieties and we often had a 3 course meal in the evening for only 9.95 there was also a good choice on the set menu not just the stuff no one wants to eat.
The staff are really friendly and will help you out with things to do on your holiday like the water parks and Pirates.
Will be going back to mallorca as we had a really nice holiday with great weather and we will definately be going back to Bobbys.
This restuarant was recommended by a local expat who lives in Tenerife and we went for dinner on a thursday.
"Unfortunately since we booked late (30 minutes before we went) we were unable to get a table outside , which has an amazing view of the Bay."
The Staff was very friendly and helped in the choosing the dishes.
The Seafood was fresh and the paella was o high quality.
I would definetely recommend this restuarant and would make it one of my first meals in my next visit to Tenerife.
Can't wait to return.
food to die for !
"excellent noodle bar, stylish and tasty, try the oyako don"
"Superb food, good cold white house wine, excellent location and good prices."
"Fish and seafood only served here, and it is excellent."
The view is fantastic and you are not charged a premium for it.
"Busy on Sunday with locals, go early for best outside tables."
"Relax, enjoy the food and views..."
We had a great mean here our first night in Ribadeo.
The location is gorgeous with a view of the water and the bridge.
Wall to wall windows make it impossible to have a bad seat.
We started with pulpo (octopus) appetizer.
Then we had a dish that the four of us shared.
It was crab and lobster in the shell cooked in a pan of seasoned rice.
It reminded me a bit of paella.
"While it was salty, it was still quite tasty, though very messy."
We ended with flan and a greek yogurt-esque dish served with honey on the side.
"The meal ended with chipitos for the table and we went on our way, stuffed."
Great restaurant- accepts reservations and credit cards.
"I have been to this restaraunt twice, and it was fabulous both times."
Its closed on a monday and booking is recommended for weekends.
The service is superb and i had the best paella i have ever tasted.
The location is fabulous and if you can get a table at the front you can dine with fabulous view of the ocean and the lights of La Gomera in the distance.
Beautiful.
yummy foie and oreja!
Tremendamente caro.
Aimed to rip tourists off.
Shame.
Just great!!!
"Good spanish food, great service, good wines... and amazing cheap price!!"
!
Definitely one of the best restaurants in Santa Ponsa area.
"Stylish interior decoration, good and kind service and the most important, delicious and amazing portions."
Very good price-quality relation .
great rice dishes
"good food, expensive, very bad decoration (worst i've seen)"
"Located close to the Prado, Fashion Shops, El Corte Ingles and Parks, this is the perfect Hotel/Restaurant stop-over in the city of Madrid."
Pick the top rooms with balcony terraces that overlook the busy streets.
Restaurant is superbly decorated with lovely window seating down onto the street.
Menu is regularly updated and can best be described as modern Spanish fusion.
Unusual slants on traditional dishes.
"Great value, but do make sure you book."
"Waiters are a delight, and if you are really nice will make a special cocktail for you."
Salud!
JLR score: 40/50
expensive and very small portions.

"The oldest, still open restaurant in the world."
You have to eat there at least once when visiting Madrid.

Foie is nice
"nice place,bad service"
It's the funniest restaurant I've ever been to and you can eat the best dishes from Asturias!
!
Too touristy
"The service, the presentation, the taste, the familiarity, the scenery... everything is just perfect!"
One of the best restaurants all over the world (3 Michelin stars).
Fantastic food (14 dishes) and incredible sea view of the Vasque coast from the top of the mountain where the restaurant is located.
You MUST go there for an special ocasion.
Authentic food in a rustic style.
The most medi-evil restaurant it has ever been my misfortune to know.
"Having invited 2 colleagues to dine there, we all three spent the entire night vomiting and wishing we were dead."
A great venue to take the mother-in-law.
JLR score: 3/50 - for the sheer terror factor.
Very informal ambience.
Good roasted chicken and cider.
Personally I think much better than Botin!
Fast Food catalan style...
A tiny place that serve just the best seasonal produce.
Excellent preparation and cooking.
Juanjo and Mercedes will make you feel at home.

Great seafood!
The best Tapas I'd never had in my life!

Be preared to pay a lot (2 stars michelin) but in my opinion fantastic food and service.
Best cheese table I've seen in Madrid.

A culinary treat in a delightful family restaurant.

One of the most stylish tapas bars in San Sebastian.
Nice and wide selection of local tapas
This was the best meal of my life.
Extremely fresh tapas.

Absolutely a rip off.
Bad quality.
Turist trap at the great place at the end of the Rambla
Lovely atmosphere and decor to this family-run chic rural diner.

Wine list impressive.

Very nice owners.
nice food for a very good price.
Delicious food for such a good price!
"Their fish is fantastic, as well as their sangria."
Will go back again!
This restaurant is about one of the best I have ever been to in my life.
"The food is great, the wine selection is excellent, the management is top notch, very amicable."
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in a heartbeat!
"Good food(especially anything to do with jamon), Good service, nice location and not too turistic - this place is definitly a gem."
Nice view over the harbour and the seafood was good but without the style and finesse that could be expected at the price.
Great Shawarma!.
Fridays and Saturdays there's a nice belly dancer.
"It's familiar, with a fast service."
Even the WSJ knows this place is worth visiting.
"There is nothing around, unless you deal with limestone or marble, but the food is worth the extra drive."
Food is good at viridiana.
Ambient is cozy and service is OK.
There were not enough stars to rate this restaurant.
"Amazing atmoshpere and surroundings, excellent service and delicious food ... a very special place to enjoy a lovely dinner."
Dined here on several occasions and found it to be the best in La Pineda for Brittish style food.
"Reasonable prices and excellent service in clean, comfortable surroundings."
Good menu and a good kids one too.
Also had a breakfast and it was great.
My favourite was the sweet and sour chicken and the apple crumble was superb.
"Highly recommended and I like my food, lol."
Tasty food and original interior
Food nice and good service.
Was busy every night.

JLR score: 38/50
"We have frequented this area for the past 5 years, but have only recently tried out Mandragora - a longstanding restaurant of some 20 years!"
"The food was very good, especially the Black Pig, and the desserts very artistic!"
Definitely worth a visit and we will be going back.
Probably ate here for the two weeks we were on holidays the food is fantastic and the service is very good.
Would highly recommend it
"This restaurant is made up of VERY rude staff, terrible service and pretty poor food."
"We had been wondering around looking for a nice restaurant for a while - it was my birthday and all we wanted was some delicious food and lots of tasty Rioja, first impressions looked like a great place in a great side street location!!"
"Firstly, they will place Olives(€3.20) on the table(pretty standad in Spain) plus they will serve you bread with your meal and these will all be added to your bill(€2.10each) which were not asked for at any stage, and regardless of the fact this is already one of the most expensive restaurants around this area."
The portion sizes and presentation of their food is extremely poor and totally overpriced.
The service was disgraceful...
"Although we don't speak Spanish - We certainly tried our hardest and we are both currently taking courses at home to learn the language, we dine out often and are both extremely chilled out people, but the staff actually threw things on the table..."
I certainly would not recommend this restaurant to anyone as with a bill of €120 we actually left hungry and had a really bad dining experience on what should have been a chilled out birthday dinner!
!
"off the beaten track but great place to eat, food is great must try the shoulder of lamb mmmmmmmmmm."
highly recommended.
we have tried this restaurant every year and at best it is just about ok....................?
having heard glowing reports we try it and it fails consistently every time i wish i could like it but it just doesn't happen for us...
"Ex Xampanyet doesn't need positive reviews to draw a crowd, and for good reason."
"The bustling - some would say claustrophobic - atmosphere in this small, charming tapas bar is a great mix of local and tourist."
"If you go late, order a cookie tray with excellent house cava."
You may want to order a bottle if you're squeamish; otherwise you'll pay for what you drink based on the server's eye.
That means you may begin and end with an opened bottle.
"Be prepared for sometimes raucous celebrations, especially in football (soccer) season."
This is a new restuarant in Santa Ponca and my husband and I had a lovely meal.
"Food was excellent, decor is lovely and staff were very helpful."
Not the cheapest in Santa Ponca but definitely worth a visit.
"Its a real shame nice place but really poor service nothing special on menu , warm drinks and over charged on the bill"
Great place for tapas with friends.
Excellent octopus!
"I ate some pasta with pesto, nothing special, the pesto was not very tasty and the pasta was too much ""al dente"" ."
The most disapointing thing was charge me 4.80 euros for a fresh orangejuice.
Very good pasta and desserts !
Nice decoration.
It looks like an antique shop.
Lovely place on the beach.
Great food incl a fantastic Cod Carpaccio.
Good service.
107 euros incl dessert and several beers
Went to this restaurant for my birthday as had heard great things about it and am a fan of the fat duck in UK.
The concerierge had booked a table for 9:30 and when we we arrived on time I was rudely told we were half and hour late and this could be a problem even though I explained it had been booked for 9:30 which he insisted was wrong.
Subsequently the hotel confirmed it had booked for 9:30.
There were only 3 tables with people on them - 3 remained empty all night.
We ere expecting a full menu not only tasting menus which was a dissapointment.
"The tasting menu was excellent in parts (one scallop with atichoke puree, seared tuna, pan con tomate - but with sorbet and garlic ""air"") but other courses felt like that they had been messed around with too much and took away from the ingredients."
A real let down was the cheese course with one 1 inch piece of aged manchego.
We paid extra for prawns which were very average.
"Overall a dissapointing night - had to ask for finger bowls (which they tried to pretend was lemon soup..mmmm) and clean napkins and to pour our own water and ask for top ups to the wine, which I wouldn't expect to do when paying Euro 220 for a meal."
Two of the waiters were great but the head waiter really did ruin the experience to the extent that we left without taking coffee or leaving a tip.
"I would recommend the food but just be aware that the attutude may have changed recently due to the restaurant's ""status"" and in our opinon there are many other fantastic restaurants with a far better vibe in Barcelona."
The Dauphin has a wonderful position overlooking the sea at El Portet.
"You dine high up over the beach on an open balcony (seating inside in the unlikely event of rain) Yes it is expensive, and with a bottle of modest wine will cost you at least 130 euros."
However the food is fantastic and the ambiance is to die for.
"We usually go for the set menu (there is an a la carte too) which offers several courses, all small portions, so on never feels overloaded with food."
"Meals are a leisurely affair, after all you are in Spain, allow about 2.5 hours for lunch, so you can enjoy both the food and the view."
The owner is Belgian and the majority of the staff to.
"The waiting staff are a great asset to the restaurant, with relaxed friedly service."
"They know who you are when you return (as I a sure you would after one visit) So not the cheapest place in the area, but for a special occasion, or if you just need cheered up, then head for the Dauphin."
Love the terrace!
Deplorable!
We were advised to try this resturant by the receptionist at Santa Isobel - and we were not disappointed.
"It looked tiny and packed from the outside, but there's plenty of space hidden away in this underground celler."
"They have a full range of local traditional delights, and we went for the Partridge Stew and Suckling Pork."
Both highly recommended!
I lived well over five years in central Mexico and went to the Panza in hope of finding some comfort food for my six-year-old Mexican son but instead discovered a terrible hodge-podge of antojitos mexicanos that bears very little resemblance to the sort of cuisine that you might find in Mexico (except the worst taco chains).
Thus the claim of being authentic Mexican fare (Mex-Mex as their advertising campaign announces) is extremely deceptive and should be revised.
Some of their attempts to be creative and marry Spanish and Mexican cuisines are outright disastrous (the tacos with salsa from blue Cabrales cheese are a good example).
"The 'home-made' tortillas are all flour, bland and often stale, when I asked for the more authentic corn-flour tortillas I was told that they were did not use them."
"I also found the staff lazy, disorganized and arrogant using a more Mexican than thou attitude to justify any faults in the food or service."
"The decor of the place is colourful but perhaps over the top, reminiscent of the Carlos `n Charlie's chain run by the tourist trap Andersen's Group in Mexico."
"I would only recommend the place for a drink and some authentic Tex-Mex nachos, otherwise its best to forget about a Mexican experience in Madrid.."
I recommend spending all day at Salinas Beach.
"Then get a reservation at Jockey Club around 5 for ""lunch""."
"Spend hours there grooving to the DJ's tunes, eating delicious food, and pitchers of sangria - watch the sun start to set before you go home and get ready for the night!!!"
You will love it!
"Having experienced some unmemorable eateries in Palamos, it was pleasure to happen upon La Gamba."
We read about it in a Catalania Travel Guide publication.
"Service was professional (well trained staff), food was well prepared and wines and spirits were well selected."
"0.5ltr Sangria, .375ltr white, 1 bottle water, 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 espresso, 1 Marc de Cava = €106 + tip."
Not bad!
"I discovered that Catalanian cuisine (mainstream) tends towards wholesome, hearty dishes."
"La Gamba offered it's regional dishes, but also the alternatives to traditional."
"If you wanted ""Continental cuisine"", it's there in and around Palamos, but you have to seek it out."
We visit Tenerife some 10 weeks of the year and have eaten in Slow Boat restuarant on Puerto Colon many times.
"Staff are welcoming, pleasant and food very good at reasonable price."
A free bottle of house wine is available to each two diners as long as bill comes to 20 euros.
As well as the Chinese menu you can have a selection from the Japanese menu .
We went on our 2nd night to Waikki Beach.
"The food was ok, nothing special, but three of the male staff where having an argument in the restaurant."
They then served ourselves and other customers with a rude and bad mannered attitued.
"When we mentioned this to a female waitress, we got not only a abrupt and rude service but also filthy looks which made us feel very uncomfortable."
"All in all ,not a pleasant experience and I would not recommend if it was the only restaurant in the Canaries!!"
Go there at your own risk!
Great looking bar/restaurant.
Food choice was also very good.
What really let it down was the service.
Staff were pretty miserable and running around like headless chickens.I ordered another pint when my main meal arrived and it didn't arrive until after I'd finished.
Because the food was good we actually went back a second time and found that the poor service wasn't a one off.
nice paella next to the beach
This was an acceptable restaurant but certainly not as good as the previous review.
The food was nice without being outstanding and was reasonable value The service was slow and confused.
There seemed to be some kind of dispute between the English speaking staff who were trying hard and the manager who kept mixing things up.
This Hospederia is in the heart of town.
Its a hotel/ restaurant where the walkways to the rooms almost all look down into the courtyard of the restaurant.
"There is some noise during eating hours, but it just adds to the ambiance."
The restaurant itself is recommended as well.
"Concha, the owner has got a wonderful staff of cooks who make everything with a wonderful homemade taste."
We trusted her to order for us and bring a sampling of things and we were enjoying recipes unlike any ohters we found in Spain.
Some dishes were dating bake to the Moorish period in Spain.
We were very well cared for overall.
We ate here last week and had the taster menu for 31 euros each.
"everything was perfect, although it is a chain I did not feel as though it was."
The staff were the nicest I came across all holiday.
Wish I could eat there more often!
Much ado about nothing!
"Service very unfriendly, food ok, large crowded place, nicely decorated but nothing really special"
One of the best restaurants in the city.
Next to the sea....
"In summer, please order a table outside, it´s a wonderful experience."
"If you love nice rices and good fish dishes, Barceloneta is your restaurant."
Nice white wines and cavas selection.
"The "" suquet "" is one of my favourite dishes."
They have little strawberries for your dessert.
They are wonderful with cream or orange juice.
Nice experience.
Reasonable prices.
"If you come to Barcelona, you should go."
"In summer it´s not easy to find a table, you should order some days in advance."
Enjoy your meal !!!
!
"7 August 2008 We had a meal at the Barceloneta after reading positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I just have to write and say it was a total rip off, we asked for prawns in hot garlic oil as a starter, the prawns were very small with heads and tails on, about 7 or 8 maximum and when the bill came we had been charged 28.75 euros each portion thats 57.50 euros for a starter!!!"
- can anyone beat that?
"M & L Stuart, Scarborough, N Yorkshire"
I´m from Barcelona and this restaurant is very old-fashioned.
"The food is fresh but the way they cook it, it´s completely out-of-date."
"I really recommend these restaurants with fresh and creative cuisine: ""Gaig"" and ""Moo""."
great tasting reasonable value pizzas.
Designed for sharing the smallest pizzas are for 2 to share.
Go to the second floor and enjoy the romantic view...
This was the best place we discovered with my friends in Salou!
It's NOT EXPENSIVE and absolutely DELICIOUS!
"Great seafood, great pizza and salads."
Wonderful pastas!
(Try Penne Rigate with dried tomatoes).
And divine desserts!
":) It almost sounds as if I'd been hired to write this, haha."
We had visited Cafe Berlin in 2004 and been pleased with the experience.
Sadly not so in 2008.
"What spoilt it for us was: Being seated far way from all the other diners, presumably because we had dared to bring our small child."
The menu del dai had many items unavailable.
Choice was severely limited.
"Portions were smal, not big as the other review here says."
"Put it this way, we ate our ice cream in 4 spoonfulls."
Coffee should have been provided with the menu del dai.
"It wasn't Being given butter, but not being told there was a charge for it."
And not just a small charge.
50 cents for each little shrink wrapped piece.
A shock when we got the bill.
The above three items give an atmosphere of pennypinching and of a decision to offere a reduced level of service if you were not spending more money through the a la carte.
"The owner and manager just tucked themselves away at the entrance, leaving the staff to do the work."
Incidentally there was a picture of the owner looking very matriarchal on one wall.
It felt like an act of self importance and an attempt to be superior to anyone else in the place.
It was like something Mr Grace did in Are You Being Served 30 years ago!
Tossa has many wonderful places to eat.
Do yourselves a favour and find another one.
We will do next time.
"Oh and in case you are wondering if my review has skewed their Tripadvisor grade, it hasn't."
It was already down in 16th before I posted this.
While in Spain for a few days We needed to find a good eaterie Well This turned out to be very good Especially the Cava We went for lunch one afternoon and sat outside which is very good Staff were helpful and friendly and food very good good value for money even though the Euro is poor at the moment  Try the Cava 9.50 euros per bottle compared to a Coke at 3euros Served in a cooler this was very reasonable Hard Rock Cafe Madrid is clean and tidy Thouh lots of hungry birds outside Recommended
"After a few days of terrible and/or expensive breakfast experiences, we stumbled on Cafe Flamant (in the quietish Exiample area)."
We could not stop going there for the rest of our trip which involved taking the tube or the bus...it was well worth the effort.
"They open around 12.30 Food is totally delish, pleasant place, excellent food/very high quality and very very reasonable price...we never paid more than 15 Euros for two despite going over board with our orders."
"Highly recommend their potato tortilla, rocket salad, French omlete sandwish and offcourse the pane con tomate plus coffees...can not recommend it highly enough."
"They have a restaurant next door, we did not get a chance to try it but with the cafe side this good, it is one of our little regrets not to have tried the resto for dinner."
Well worth the effort!
I loved this place.
"It's very quirky with lots of plants, old posters, old barrels signed by various famous people (eg Antonio Banderas)."
The wine & olives were great.
The staff were friendly.
Great place for a few drinks & snack before going elsewhere for a full meal.
Nice paeia.
"After hearing a lot of positive things about this place, I decided to check it out, and my expectations were high."
"Since it's marketed as an Italian place with a wood-fired oven, of course I had to try the pizza, so I ordered a pie with chili sauce and ham - and it was to be honest 100% tasteless."
"I had expected a taste explosion not unlike what I experienced at NYC's excellent Lombardi's a couple of months ago, but eating the La Bella pie was like eating a piece of slighty wet bread with no topping."
"And it was not crunchy or crispy at all, as you would expect from an Italian pizza."
I was VERY disappointed.
"I also had dessert, a pannacotta that neither fulfilled my expectations."
It tasted like a generic dairy product with chocolate topping.
"My friend ordered a tiramisu, and it was so rich that it almost became unedible... you were nauseous after eating one third of the dessert."
It wasn't even that mindblowingly good that you perhaps hoped a tiramisu would be at an Italian restaurant.
The place was completely packed when we were there and very noisy.
"It had a nice authentic Napolitan atmosphere, even with framed Maradona pictures on the wall from his Napoli years, and you could see the chefs working at your pizza and the dough while you wait."
A nice touch.
"All in all, go for that authentic Napolitan experience, but don't expect to be blown away by the pizza (nor the dessert)."
"You'll probably be better off ordering one of the (disappointingly few offered) pasta dishes, one of my friends got the spaghetti bolognese and he was pleased with it."
But I will certainly not go there again.
"good for late fatty breakfast, for other meals not recommended"
This restaurant is right next to the Church and has an attractive outdoor eating area under the trees with a covered area with large french windows for when the weather is not so good.
The menu is substantial with a decent menu el dia.
We ate here on three occasions with varying degrees of satisfaction.
In September last year -our first visit - quite busy with a couple of parties but nice table outside and a friendly welcome.
We started with a great plate of parrillada horal with followed by Lubina plancha for her and for me a plain Entecot Plancha (perfectly cooked - medium).
"Good selection of vegetables , both grilled and boiled."
"Bottle of rose , beer and water and a shared crema catalan came to €53."
A good experience - lovely vegetables and good service.
"In May this year we returned and had a totally different experience- it was quite busy with a couple of large parties but found a nice table for two , again outside."
Same staff on as last time.
Waited for 10 mins for menu which I had to go and fetch.
Had to wave to get order taken -thought of doing a Winner and waving napkin around my head but it was not linen!
Started with Pan Tostados and my wife had her usual lubina (very nice) and me lomo plancha but this time NO veg just rock hard triple cooked chips.
Tried to attract attention but eventually took chips to kitchen for fresh ones.
New ones arrived - not much better!
So fed up I had a Cafe Irlandes to finish to cheer me up.
"Bill €44 Our first experience was a joy , the second dismal."
For some unknown reason we returned in June - the weather was unpredictable so we wanted fresh air but to be under cover so we decided to give La Boca another chance.
We also checked there were no large tables set as from previous experience the service slips when it is full.
Glad we sat under cover as within 20 mins the shower arrived and the customers at three outside tables had to scuttle in for cover!
"Service was spot on- we chose pork loin in pepper sauce and a beautiful plate of freshly grilled vegetables,some fries and our usual beer and rosado."
Finished off with a creme catalan and a bill of €44.
"A good experience,freshly prepared and presented food and therefore back on our ""list"" We will return but before sitting down we will check there are no large parties in the restaurant- that would appear to be when problems in service and food quality occur."
"Would have given it a 4* , but down to a 3* because of the disappointment of our second visit."
"We actually planned our two week holiday around visiting Arzak, or to be exact around the final confirmation of a table there."
"We were really looking forward to the visit after having read quite a lot about the restaurant and several excellent reviews that made us plan our holiday according to being able to visit the restaurant, as I said."
"From before we usually go to an exceptional restaurant during our holiday, and this was in that regard the best of them all if rating by its 3 Michelin-stars..."
"The place itself was nice, as we expected, and we were shown to nice table upstairs, and as it ""happened"" beside another Norwegian couple... Not a problem in itself, and they were nice people - but the Headwaiter made a point of it, and it was obvious that they had planned it so... Not a problem, but a dissapointment since we had travelled some thousand km by car from Norway to get away from it all, and treating ourselves with this special experience..."
The main problem started with the main menu which was in Spanish.
However their Degustation menu for a 150 Euros each (not very expencive by Norwegian standards) was also in English.
"As it turned out the language became quite a ""show-stopper"" for us, since none of the many waitresses who served, and presented the food in Spanich could a word of English or French..."
"So we were presented dish after dish without beeing able to understand a word... And thus missing out on what is a part of the totality, opening up for small questions and smalltalk with them as by our standards also a natural part of good service..."
"It all looked great, and a few of the dishes also tasted great (especially since we tried some of eachothers dishes - they served some different dishes to the men and women) - but the main impression and memory was not one that will go into any ""hall of fame"" by our standards (with regards to the total experience: food, wine, service, atmosphere)..."
"Especially since we were very dissapointed with the Headwaiters wine-suggestion which he conferred about with the Sommelier... All we asked was that we wanted something Spanish since we after all were in Spain... We should perhaps have reacted about the quite low price on the red wine, but it was a nice Rioja the Sommelier told us."
"We actually stated that we could very well try something else, maybe a Rebera wine, (emphasising that price was not a major concern) if he rather would recommend that for us..."
But no...
So all in all we cannot really recommend Arzak.
"Try instead - if ever in Copenhagen - Formel B (a gem of a restaurant), or for that matter many of the small excellent tapas-bars in the old town of San Sebastian!"
Well worth it and much more fun!
All in all we had some other more memorable and as good dinners other places in France during this holiday... And none of them 3 * restaurants... :-)
This is an excellent restaurant.
Food is fresh & very good quality.
Superb customer service.
Fabulous location for the sunset.
The Maitre D is very personable & has excellent customer service skills.
A pleasure to eat here.
"""discovered"" this restarant last summer so we decided to go back to this lovely restaurant, at our Mallorca trip this year."
"It' s still a very very nice place, untrendy with very well cooked spanish dishes such as suckling pig, bellota ham and so on."
A great wineceller with decently priced wines and so is the food.
Great friendly efficient (very) service.
4 people can eat here for around 200€ inkluding wine.
All this makes it really worth a visit when in lovely Palma de Mallorca!
"It's a splendid restaurant in it's ""class"", not a ""star"" establishment but very good food, ambiance and service!"
"Very nice restaurant, excellent food and good service."
A funky restaurant split over 3 floors Basement - Smoking tables Ground floor - Bar and waiting area 1st floor - Non Smoking tables We were looking for a light bite to eat one evening without compromising on decor/quality of food.
"We chose the tapas, all of which were lovely, and with attentive waiting staff we were more than happy with our choice amongst the hundreds of eating places tucked away in Palma old town's winding streets Would def go back"
The Seafood Paella + service + location = Great!
"Depends what you want, for some I can see this would be an out of this world experience."
This was attention to detail as we have never experienced it before.
We went on a Monday in late July so maybe no surprise that there were 4 diners incl the two of us and 7 waiters.
"We had a waiter to pour our water, one to pour wine one who took our coats, even a mini stool for my wife to put her handbag on by the side of her chair!"
Beautiful food cooked to perfection but perhaps slightly fussy?
Great wine list.
Overall a very good night but we felt a bit as if we were on show and felt a bit on edge as if the whole thing was a performance.
"Maybe  more of a reflection on us than Kresala, I think it would have been better if it had been busier"
Excellent food and even better service.
"Our only compliant was the decor was a little modest, with a few simple touches of blue glass hung on the walls."
"Isn't it infuriating when you find a great bar in a great place with nice food and a good bar menu, that undoes all its good work by having the most unfriendly, arrogant, aloof and in dire need of training waiters and staff."
The second time we went was exactly the same....which I guess means that's the way the owners want it.
Pity.
Went to Barcelona for a three-day birthday treat.
"Booked the Bestial in advance, on recommendation, for my birthday dinner for me and my husband."
"Great location, good food, but service not great ."
The hostess was not exactly welcoming and it took ages for the waiter to come over and take our drinks order.
We could only book an early slot and it seemed a shame that the ambience was getting going just a short while before we left.
"Our lasting memory is of unfriendly and tardy waiting staff, which isn't on when we spent well over 100 euros for our meal."
"On the whole, we enjoyed our dinner on the beautiful garden terrace, but we wouldn't return."
best what you get at barajas airport
Lovely place frequented by some stars as evidenced by the plaques on the wall by our seats.
Very good food only spoiled by the fact that our waitress had obviously forgotten my order resulting in my wife having her main course 20 minutes before mine came.
The management did give us a half bottle of nice Cava as an apology and the food (when it came) was great.
Full of locals which is a good sign- would give them a second chance.
"Lovely position overlooking the beach at Barraca and the food wasn't bad, the service however was chaotic to say the least!"
"We waited two hours between our first dish being delivered and the last, we were asked if we wanted coffee or the bill when we hadn't yet got our calamari!"
It was pretty busy but I've never seen and heard so many plates/glasses etc being dropped in any restaurant.
So the food was nice but the staff need some training!
This place is just a MUST if visiting Cadiz.
We ended up going here 4 nights in a row.
The Iberian chargrilled pork is marvelous!
The restarant is beautiful and crowded so come early (opens 20.30) or make reservations.
This is also the place for tapas.
"The bar is packed, and the feeling is frendly, happy and very spanish."
I can not end my praising of this place.
"The coldcuts, the chees the meat!"
Oh lala!!!
Be sure to ask for an extra plate of the olives you get.
They are heaven!
"The food was modern, french style."
"Not really cheap, rather expensive I'd say."
More waiters than customers.
One of the Barcelona musts!
Everything's perfect and the price is not too exopensive.
great modern food expertly prepared.This is fine dining with very friendly service.
"We have being going to Benahavis, for 25 years and this is one of our favourite restaurants."
"It is family run, and I mean family; Ruffino and his lovely wife, employs son, daughters, cousins, in laws and lots of the locals.The food is Spanish/English ,caters for lots of tastes and is very good."
"The service is fast, the waiters are very pleasant and are always pleased to see every one, be they regulars or newcomers."
Nothing is too much trouble and they will accommodate you whatever the size of your party.
We just love them all.
"Joyce and Iain, Newcastle upon Tyne."
"I'm don't know Madrid in depth, but i'm a very demanding about food, and i can tell you that this place had the best tapas of that area of Madrid, where we also tried a few other places."
Great food and great atmosphere!
Highly recommended!
Visited for dinner in August 2008.
"Extremely popular with locals, which we took as a good sign."
Menu varied and the resultant food proved to be very good.
Wine list not extensive but not at all expensive.
If visiting at weekends don't be surprised to wait to get in even at 11-30pm
The only thing this place has going for it is the fact that it's cheap.
"The staff is very unfriendly, and downright rude."
"I had a chicken dish that came with pasta, no taste."
"Our girls had deep fried shrimp skewers, my husband had the tripe dish, mostly beans."
I would do a big SKIP on this place.
"1.5 km along Calpe road from Moraira is run by the owners of Refugio (see other reviews for Refugio), who are the Valles Family (Isabel and Juan)."
It offers solid value for money eating out - pizzas and a range of other dishes.
"This is not gourmet cooking, but it is relatively cheap."
The result is that they do attract masses of diners all year round.
"Personally I find it too packed together with other diners, and the food is a little too middle of the road."
We have been cold there in winter.
However one cannot knock Gemisant.
It is a well patronised local institution that offers good value for what you will eat and drink.
Basically you will get value for what you pay.
"No more, no less, and unfortunately one cannot say that of all restaurants these days."
A great family run restaurant providing the best of spanish food.
The fish is always the very best.
"However, the steak with pepper sauce is heavenly."
Another Spanish family restaurant.
local to Benahavis.
"food good service good also,clean and friendly, village people eat there, so that s a good sign, we have being going there for 25 years, everything as good as was when we found it."
Joyce and Iain
"We stopped at Casa Duque to sample the regional dish Cochinillo, roasted suckling pig."
It was the best meal we had in all of Spain!
"The five of us ordered a whole Cochinillo, and it was more than we could possibly finish."
The Cochinillo was roasted perfectly.
"The meat was tender and juicy, with an incredible flavor and texture."
The skin was crispy and delicious!
The service was also wonderful.
"Our older tuxedoed waiter was professional, but friendly and fun."
"The atmosphere was extremely comfortable, not to stiff and formal, but not casual either."
The walls were covered with awards and pictures of the King and Queen of Spain at the restaurant.
"I'll admit that I didn't have cochinillo anywhere else in the area, but I can't imagine it being any better than at El Duque."
"Although the meal was a little pricey (about 50 euro each for five of us with wine, bread and salad), it was well worth it!"
A must stop in Segovia!
Thought we'd treat ourselves to a meal out rather than have the 'all inclusive' at our hotel.
We all fancied a steak and found this restaurant by chance.
Tables were available inside and out -we chose inside as we were suffering from too much sun.
"Waiter offered us a menu and took our drinks order immediately- 1 large beer, large jug of sangria and a lemonade."
These arrived quickly and we were allowed to ponder the menu whilst munching on the lovely fresh bread and superb garlic butter that had appeared with the drinks.
"After much deliberation, we ordered 2 beef steak and chips, peppercorn sauce and a mixed grill with a side order of chips."
"When the food arrived my husband nearly fell off his chair at the huge amount of meat on his plate...the mixed grill consisted of 2 pieces of grilled chicken, sausage, a rack of beef ribs & 2 diffferent steaks-he regretted ordering the chips as salad came with the grill too!!"
"The other steaks were huge, cooked to perfection & served with a salad dressing."
Our only regret was not having enough room to sample one of the desserts on offer.
Value for money....the meal including drinks cost 56 Euros.
"If you only go out for a meal once during your holiday, make it this restaurant as you won't regret it."
Very well situated in the centre of the town.
It looks inviting with thatched parasols over the outdoor tables.
"The menu was good, as was the food."
We found the staff strange (!)
maybe it was a language thing.
"The food was good but it was a bit pricey, and wasn't special enough, in our opinion, to justify the extra euros."
Very crowded and popular.
We could have avoided the wait by making reservations.
While waiting in line in bar area - you could order drinks and tapas.
Food was very good.
We had the chicken and sole (whole lenguado).
We were seated upstairs in a very nice area.
The dessert (creme brule) was one of the best ever eaten.
My husband was there 25 years ago and its still good.
"I have only eaten here once, but that once was enough to make me unlikely to return."
"The setting is charming, close to the sea, in a very quiet part of Calpe."
"It is part of an apartment complex, and the pool is a feature of the courtyard in which the restaurant sits."
"If it is warm enough, then you can sit outside i this courtyard."
Our problem was poor service.
Like many restaurants Puerto Blanco has difficulty getting and retaining staff.
"So then employ Eastern European waiters, who command of Spanish is limited."
There tends to be a bit of a culture gap between what a Bulgarian waiter's idea of service and mine.
"Anyway if you have indifferent service, long delays in getting food (in Spain I expect long delays and like them, but not that long), you are less than enamoured when you get a large bill."
"Had the food been outstanding, perhaps I could have forgiven this, but for the price, I would describe the food as middle of the road."
So not going back there again!
This friendly pizzeria is a great place to stop for lunch before exploring the pretty town of Arta.
Food is simple but tasty and the restaurant has plenty of outside tables in the shade.
"Pizzas are thin, crispy and not too heavy - they are big though!"
good japanese in sarria.try to get a seat by the tepanaki in the entrance .
La Tabla is a little far away from the centre of Gijon.
"Decoration is really nice http://www.restaurantelatabla.com/ The rate is high in comparision with Asturias price, but you pay for a good place, the food is really super."
"But the best of all the owner has a great wine list, with really unkown but marvellous wines."
It is a good choice Rate paid at JUly 08 around Eur 40.
This restaurant is not cheap but the Flamenco show that goes with the meal is amazing.
The food is also excellent.
I would not miss going to this restaurant again.
"We only had one night in Segovia, but our first impression was that it is an expensive place to eat."
We were also looking for a change from Spanish cuisine.
"For these reasons, finding 'La Juderia' was a stroke of good luck, and we enjoyed a great meal there at a very resonable price."
The restaurant serves food from throughout the middle east.
There are various menu options and all look to be good value.
The starters in particular (e.g.
falafel and houmus variants) were out of this world and all the portions were healthily sized.
The owner seems to have a real passion for the food served and was keen to dscuss it wth us!
"If I'm ever back in Segovia, I will make sure that I pay a repeat visit."
"We dined at Oustau on 2 occasions during our 3 week stay in July/Aug 08 and were extremely impressed with the quality of food, service and price."
The cusine does have a French influence with extensive choices of fish and meat dishes - highly recommended!
An enthusiastic greating disarms the patron.
Crustaceans and fresh fish are promoted with flair by a persuasive waiter.
No menu or price list is presented.
"Recommendations are accepted and we enjoy our selection of lobster, langostinos, and prawns , followed by fresh Sea bass."
Then the bill arrives.
Dinner for 3 (including 86 Euros for wine) is 540 Euros before tip.
We live.
We learn (to insist on a menu).
Ouch Not sure a reservation made by our hotel helped.
Wink Wink (The food was good.
The environment - casual)
Very friendly waitress- but did forget our drinks.
Good tapas and great value- 77 euros incl 7 beers for the two of us.
Nice setting outside on the square to watch the world go by
Cool for a snack
"Hi , i was in Marbella for seven nights ."
I took dinner on the 12th of August 2008.
Santigo is a very bad sea-food restaurant.
I went with my family.
Our main dish was grilled prawns.
The main dish was really bad to the extend that i did not continue my food and this applies for all of the family.
We are Egyptians and we love sea-food .
The taste of the food was really bad.
The prawns were not cooked properly and it was not grill but i think boiled only.
The waiter did not even ask us why we did not continue our food.
The food was really bad.
This restaurant is located in the historical part of Marbella facing the sea but the tast of the food is really bad.
It is also an expensive restaurant without any value.
I do not recommend this restaurant for anybody who is looking to eat in a decent sea-food restaurant.
We own two travel agencies in Egypt.
We travel a lot and my evaluation is based on my last experience is this restaurant.
Please do not consider this restaurant as an option to save yourself from a very painful experience
"service is crasy, food is excellent, not worth it"
This Michelin starred restaurant was 10 minutes from our hotel the Pampinot.
The service was excellent and relaxed.
The wine expertly chosen.
We both had pidgeon as a main course.
My wife generally does not like game but even she loved this dish.
The starters and sweets were equally expertly produced.
It was the best food we ate in the Basque country.
"Price for 2 was 150 euros, and worth the money."
My husband and I stumbled across this great cider/tapas bar on our first visit to Valencia.It seemed a must since I like cider!
"First impression was one of amazement, as we spotted small barrels on the sawdust floor, which we soon realised were spitoons!!"
"There is only one type of cider, which is poured from an arms length and height (to let the air in) into a short glass."
It is very strong and an acquired taste!
"we only had the one.The atmosphere was friendly, and the food being served looked appetising."
Since we were on our way to dinner we agreed to go back another time.
"We were so glad we did, there was a wonderful selection of tapas, one of my favourites was sliced black pudding, which tasted as though it had been gently fried in butter with a mild flavour of cumin."
"Another favourite was"" salted foreleg of pork"", this arrived in fine slices drizzled with olive oil."
There was a platter of 5 cheeses from the Asturias which had different strengths.
"Plentiful bread was available, and all was washed down with some great wines."
"You choose the wine from a menu written in chalk on the wall.We visited again, but never understood what you were supposed to do with the cider, the locals all seemed to take a mouthful and spit it into the aforesaid barrels followed by the remainder.No one seemed concerned about this .It had a great atmosphere, friendly staff and was reasonably priced."
"Being a tapas bar, you can make it as cheap or as expensive as you wish."
This is a typical workers restaurant which caters for a few tourists and ex-pats too.
"It excels with its range of cheap, tasty local dishes, and at lunchtime its somewhat frenetic atmosphere."
Be prepared to queue and enjoy the experience!
I have been going here for over twenty years.
I have returned this this part of Malaga year after year and continue to visit this family run restaurant on a regular basis.
"Its friendly, relaxing and great value for money."
The food is out of this world and service is always with a friendly smile.
Known as the oldest Campero restaurant in Malaga it certainly lives up to its name.
"Its conveniently located right opposite the beech, which is a stones throw away."
You can sit beneath the palm trees and watch the waves roll in whilst tucking into a tasty campero.
The restaurant is ideally situated in the heart of El Pedregal beech front.
The area comes alive at night with Mafalda being the central meeting point for all the locals in the area.
Its an ideal place to sit and watch the world go by day or night.
Its well worth a visit even if its just to sample a Campero!
Cant wait to go back.
"Recommended to us by a time share rep, so not perhaps wholly reliable, nevertheless we had a very pleasant meal."
"Good menu, not the usual rubbish you get down at the sea front."
Quite expensive (UK prices) but worth the trip once during your holiday.
I have been to this restaurant twice and I agree that the setting is fantatic - especially the outdoor seating area - but the food was overpriced and not very good at all.
Such a shame because it could be a really great place.
My husband and i went here early in May as it was for our anniversary.
No it is not cheap to eat here but this meal was for a special occasion.
The gardens are lovely with fairy lights all around.
"The wine (house rose) was good and a reasonable price, the food was great and plenty of it."
During the evening the chief sings and he came out to us and gave all the ladys a red rose.
We had a prawn cocktail to start with and this was huge.
We then had chateaubriand for our main mean (this you share between the two of you) one of the cheapest meals on the menu and it was huge.
This was really lovely and for our dessert we went for the crepes which were cooked in front of you and they were really lovely.
All in all a very special night.
The whole meal came to around €120 but we thought as a one off special meal it was well worth it.
Told friends who have also been and also really loved the place.
"Having walked extensively through the cobbled streets of the Barri Gottic for four days, my partner and I decided to forget our al fresco rule and eat indoors."
"The ambience of El Salon is so easy, unpretentious and has a feeling of being very 'authentic'."
"Tiles fill one wall, all the chairs and tables are mismatched which works so well."
"As for the food, we were both really pleased we decided to eat there!"
"The ravioli, risotto, veal burger with foie pate, chocolate fondant etc were so well executed."
"Highly recommended for good service, ambience and romantic meal."
We stayed in Salou for 7 nights and found this restaurant on our 2nd night.
We liked it because the Spanish families were eating here.
It had a lovely relaxed atmosphere.
We didn't want to eat in a 'British home from home' place.
"Most of our evening meals were here, and every meal was freshly made, a very good sized serving, hot and served with a smile."
"We never felt that we'd paid more than we should, infact the opposite, at home in the UK we would have paid more We would go back again for sure."
"The restaruant is on the sea front, with a nice breeze, (which we welcomed some nights)."
We were never 'raced' to eat and move on.
We had to ask for our bill and then we had to ask to pay our bill.
Our boys loved the pizza's.
"Not oily at all, and our salads were great."
"Pinoys going to Spain, try Ciudad Condal and stay at the bar seats."
The Pinoy waiters will take care of you with their hospitality.
Great Seafood and Sangria!
Look for Butch and his friends to help you with the endless choices of Tapas and desserts.
I felt right at home!
Taxidriver told us to try this tapas bar with loungy look and we fell for it first time we visited.
"We tried other taps bars, this one was the best!"
"You can sit at the bar and make your own choise, but also take a table at the back of the restaurant., facing a wall with huge display of cans of International beer-brands, nicely lit (see photo)."
"Tapas change every day, excellent food, concerning staff, No backpackers, well dressed Spanish locals and business men/woman."
No tourists.
"High arched ceilings, like a church."
Next to Placa Catalunya.
"To avoid crowds, get there early afternoon, enjoy the crowd with a glass of wine."
Gets really busy after 9 PM.
go for it!
L´Olive is a nice restaurant in Barcelona.
It´s a little bit crowded in summer period.
"You can find a good offer of rices, fresh fishes and nice meals."
The service is fantastic.
Good wine and cava selection.
The price is OK in relation to the service and the quality of the ingredients they are using.
The average price per person ( without beverage ) is about 40-50 euros.
"The young lad that served us could not have been more distant if he had tried, we were the first people in and we waited to be seated for about 3 minutes only to be sat on the first seat next to the door."
"The food was mediocre to say the least, we were asked if we wanted fries or jacket potato 2 of the party went for the jacket potato only to be given potato wedges (if might just have been a translation thing) he took our order but wrote nothing down so that might be why we got the wrong things."
"The coleslaw was horrible and the BBQ sauce was very weak, even though there was now only 4 other people in it still took an age to get a fresh drink as he seemed to be the only person working."
"Then the manager (David) arrived and proceeded to give the young lad a telling off in the middle of the restaurant for about 5 minutes, he also clipped another member of staff around the back of the head as he arrived late."
When I tried to get the bill David brought it and was as off hand as the first young lad.
All in all it was the worst service and food I had during my stay in Valencia
"Had we seen the comments on this restaurant on TripAdvisor, under a review of the unconnected(?)"
"Hostal El Alfarero, we would not have visited it, but unfortunately we had not and we did!"
We are a family of two adults with two teenage daughters.
"I speak good Spanish, my husband some Spanish but my daughters little or none."
"We arrived at the restaurant at about 1.30pm, very early for Spain."
One other table was apparently occupied in another room and we were the only people in the main dining area.
"Things did not start well when we ordered two local beers, in a restaurant specialising in local products, and were told they only had one bottle."
"The waitress (I assume the same ""surly ""one encountered by the earlier reviewer) gave us menus and returned a couple of minutes later to take our order."
"We asked for more time as the menu was both very long and very complex, full of local, unfamiliar dishes and cuts of meat with unusual sauces, all of which had to be translated, or guessed at, and remembered by the whole party."
"She then came back a few minutes later, looked exasperated and produced one incredibly badly translated English menu."
"For example ""pasas"" (""raisins"") translated as ""you pass""."
She gave us about three minutes to digest this - and I must admit that much of that time was spent marvelling at the translations.
A couple of minutes later she reappeared and informed us that she could not wait any longer as we had had plenty of time to choose and she had another table to serve.
I pointed out that the restaurant was almost empty and likely to remain so for another half hour and that the menu was very complex.
She was unimpressed by this argument and insisted that we order.
"My younger daughter, in particular, had only just got her hands on the ""English"" version and was no where near ready to choose, so we decided to leave."
We asked to speak top the owner and were informed that she was the owner.
"Without a word of aplogy, she then charged us 18 euros for four drinks and four uneaten bread rolls."
"I also note that there is also a very negative review, by a Spaniard, of this place on Ciao.es, complaining of the reverse problem, slow service, but the same rude attitude."
The contrast with our experience of almost all the other Spanish restaurants and staff that we encounted in our stay was remarkable.
How this place can be recommended in the Lonely Planet guide book is beyond me.
It's worth wait an hour to eat here.
"I've tried Tapas in several places around Spain, but i've never tried something like that."
"If you are looking for a good example of Tapas, decent service and a pleasent environment; Cerveceria Catalana is a great place to start."
it gets very busy so turn up early.
Several people recommended to us the Sukhothai restaurant in Marbella saying it is 'excellent' and 'world-class'.
"The beef satay was almost tasteless, not marinated and served with a watery mild peanut sauce."
About the worst we've eaten anywhere.
The rest of the meal was good.
"We rated it almost as good as our favorite Thai restaurants in Casablanca, Morocco (Thai Gardens) and Waltham, MA, USA (Erawan of Siam)."
Ambiance unpleasant.
"Crowded, noisy, no elbow room, you listen to the conversations on both sides of you."
Almost like eating in a mess hall.
Service good but just on the edge of making you feel that you should hurry to eat and leave so they can seat more guests.
"Unless we're dying for Thai food, unlikely to return."
"Had really good tapas here, had to sit right by the road side which wasn't so good, there are tables further back up the stairs but we had a disabled companion who couldn't make it up there."
"The food was really good, service very friendly and not too pricey, one of the best we've had in Javea."
"after 2 weeks in barcelona we have eat the best paella ever, yamiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"
The advantage of Es Passeig in Port de Soller is its location.
It seems popular with families.
It claims to have the most creative menu in the area.
"As vegetarians we were welcomed, and invited to choose a main course from which they would extract the meat or fish."
I would advise that you to ask for an ice cube to cool down you frink if you opt for fino as an aperitif.
(In Jerez it is served so cold the glass frosts with condensation.
Here it was served at room temperature - a British restaurant would know better!)
"The meal began with the standard bread, olives and aoili (for which you pay even if you don't order it - but you get used to that in Mallorca )."
We asked for one of the tapas dishes as a starter (eg feta and peppers).
"But we didn't ask why all other starters were not delivered at the same time - and it meant I lost out!The waiting staff don't write down the orders, so a dining hazard in this establishment seems to be a forgotten dish."
I delayed in notifying staff of my missing food and was informed that as the main course was being prepared it was too late to get my forgotten starter delivered (and it was only gazpacho!)
"My main course of smoked goats cheese with red pepper-green bean salad in a springroll pastry basket and basil-tomato vinaigrette sounded grander than it appeared, andwas nothing to write home about."
It was a starter-sized salad in a crispy round of won ton.
My husband's spring rolls with marinated wok-fried vegetables and orange-chilli sauce comprised very over cooked and soggy stir fried veg.
"But the worst was yet to come - a desert of vanilla crepe with caramel ice-cream, apple carpaccio and blueberry mousse features a thick pancake, shredded into ribbons and scattered on top of the ice cream so that it goes cold and glutinous."
(Bretons would be ashamed of the misuse of their regional cuisine.)
"The apple carpaccio is a thick brown goo, and the blueberry mousse lacks flavour."
"However the management were very professional - after complaining to the waitress and the manageress, we were not charged for desert."
"But this place should not be recommended to anyone, and my hotel is considering not making any further bookings there for their guests."
Myself and my boyfriend visited this restaurant one night whilst on holidays as a result of an excellent review in the lonely planet.
We were utterly dissapointed by the experience.
We arrived at the restaurant to find 7 members of staff all standing intimidatingly at the front door.
"One looked my boyfriend up and down and gave a pained expression, being obviously of the opinion that he was not well dressed enough, however were were allowed to be shown to a table."
"We were initially seated by a very pleasant member of staff, but unfortunately she did not serve us for most of our meal."
"It was quite obvious that our Spanish was very rudimentary and after some effort on our behalf to make ourselves understood in our bad Spanish, my boyfriend had a sudden flash of inspiration and asked for an English menu."
Lo and behold they actually had one but had not bothered to offer it.
The woman who took our order was surly and uncommunicative to the extreme.
She never cracked a smile even once.
"The waitress who opened our bottle of wine, did so quite unprofessionally whilst looking everywhere but us, having a conversation with another waitress and maintaining a dour expression the whole time."
"She then sloshed the wine into our glasses and left, also without cracking a smile."
"The lady who had taken our order continued with her unfriendly attitude throughout the whole meal, as she did with every other table in the room and tried to sneak off with the last of out bottled water until my boyfriend pointedley eyeballed the bottle to make her realise he was watching her."
"The food was good and my main course was melt in the mouth, but no one bothered to tell us that the mains did not come with any accompaniements."
When i ordered some patatas fritas I was brought Burger King style soggy chips.
"We were totally disgusted at spending so much money on a thouroughly unpleasant meal and although the food was good, it was cetainly not amazing and was overpriced."
It was definately not worth putting up with such terrible service.
We have both worked in the service industry for about 10 years and in general we were amazed at the rudeness of waiters in Cordoba.
We will never go back to bodegas campos!
"Excellent food, a very nice atmosphere and swift service."
Highly recommendable restaurant!
The terrace is a lovely place to eat lunch when the weather is good.
"The fish is great, and the rice dishes are marvelous."
They are apt to be heavy-handed with the salt though.
I went twice and found that to be the case each time.
"Also, while their wine list is good, they have too few half-bottles; makes dining alone an excuse to get drunk with a full bottle."
"Excellent cuisine -for those who like genuine Indonesian food- and an excellent service, at an affordable pricelevel."
Very cheap!
"We had the menu del dia, nothing exciting, just adequate but quite a nice red wine and very cheap at 8.95euros all in."
Nasty plastic seats but very jolly staff who made the experience fun if not a gastronomic delight!
Words cannot describe this restaurant.
Views to die for.
Food amazing.
Service friendly and professional.
Entertainment..was a tenor who was fab.
I cannot recommend it enough.
"I am out there on sunday in fuengirola for 2 weeks, and will be booking for a thursday evening to watch the flemenco show."
Expensive but well well worth every penny... Well done Valparaiso--Adios
"Very nice place to have dinner in Ibiza downtown, do not miss Paella Boganvante (Lobster Paella) which is great!!!!!!!"
Huge portions too.
Spanish wines selection good.
Waiter and maitre very polite.
I liked it a lot.
We went there at the recommendation of our lovely concierge and the cab driver confirming it is a fantastic restaurant.
Admittedly we arrived at 11:15pm so they refused to serve us paellas or tapas.
"So we were forced to take two steaks, a whole jug of sangria."
The restaurant closed around midnight so it was all a little tight.
"Bread and sausages arrive at our table (which we did not order, but had to pay for), steaks arrived shortly after with terrible blue cheese sauce...which looked like custard, sloppy service etc."
"The damage - for an utterly disgusting meal, terrible sangria, at the salamanca in Barceloneta district - was 70 Euros for the meal without desert and 30Euros for the taxis, Goodbye 100 Euros!"
"Don't go there, better off have an equally nasty kebabs for 10% of the cost."
We have been here many times and the food and service is second to non.
First let me say it is not the cheapest by any means but its not a menu of the day cheapy.
I had scallops to start and my husband had endives with blue cheese.
"For the main course i had Duck in orange sauce and my husband had the best steak he has had in years, perfectly cooked."
The Wine was delicious and very reasonably priced and the coffee and brandy just rounded off a perfect evening.
We go there every time we visit Benalmadena and have never had a bad meal yet.
"i would recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Benalmadena, if you like good food and excellent service in typical Spanish surroundings."
Casa Cantó Restaurant is a Spanish owned restaurant in the village of Benissa.
"The owner and his family are Spanish, courteous and very welcoming."
My wife and I like to eat here regularly.
"The food is good, the art deco interior is eclectic, the hospitality is warm and there is a fabulous view out over the rock of Calpe in the distance Casa Canto's fixed price menus are particularly good value for money."
"There is a limited choice menu, fixed price and including half a bottle of wine all under 30 euros a head."
"There is also a Gourmet fixed price menu with more courses (but does not include the wine) If ranking the things I like here, I would put hospitality and the genuine welcome top, followed by the decor (not many places where you recommend people to visit the loos, but here they are worth mentioning in their own right."
A Spanish restaurant at its best.
We were attracted to the restaurant bucause it looked very traditional from the outside.
"The food was great, and they do have an English menu if needed."
"The waiting staff were very friendly My Spanish isn't too hot and the waiter's English was only a bit better, but we got along just fine."
"Small restaurant, probably need to book in advance but we managed to get in and eat in the 'garden room' at the back."
We had a variety of dishes that we shared out (2 adults 2 children aged 8 and 6).
"All the dishes were very good - very well presented, very fresh and decent portions."
Great puddings also.
It is a very enjoyable place.
The food is superb and the waiters work hard to please you.
Strange one this.
"They serve very good food, but with an indifference that leaves one speechless."
I have eaten there three times and it takes me a couple of years to forget how bad the service is.
"I remember the food, and some time later try again, but with the same results."
"Excellent food, poorly served."
And the ambiance is somewhat lacking.
"When you are paying top prices, which is what they charge, then you should, in my opinion expect either warm, friendly service or professional friendly service."
To get the food plonked in front of you with indifference means that I do not enjoy the evening.
"If you look at my other reviews for Moraira restaurants, you will see that I look for the right mix of good food, friendly service, pleasant surroundings and value for money (that does not mean cheap by the way."
"You will see I am happy with expensive restaurants that do offer value for money) So perhaps you see with very good food, I am tempted to try La Sort again after the passage of time."
However each time the same indifferent service
"It may be a beach restaurant, but I really liked the food there."
"It is said to have among the best paella in Torremolinos, and I for one loved it."
Good menu del dia at lunchtime.
"Reasonably priced, good, swift service."
Excellent paella.
Definitely one to consider for lunch.
Jose Maria is a place you will never forget.
"Ascending the narrow cobbled road, amid ancient aqueducts, to arrive at Jose Maria's is the entree to an unforgettable meal."
"The atmosphere, the wine and the food combine to create an authentic experience fraught with a sense of history."
"If you crave phenomenal Spanish faire, do not miss the cochinillo."
"If like myself you are thinking, ""I don't like ham."""
try it anyway-it melts like butter in your mouth.
"Also, the signature soup with large white beans promises a return of happiness."
We visit Piscis regularly as it delivers for us a mix of friendly service and good food.
It is Spanish owned and run.
"The restaurant is in the centre of Moraira, on one of the cross streets, just back from the sea front."
They have interesting modern etched glass front to the restaurant.
"Mediterranean cookery of a good quality, particularly fish dishes like the wonderful Lenguado, the excellent Merluza, the succulent Rape."
"A nice touch is getting a glass of Cava on the house (I think eveyone gets one, we do anyway) while you are choosing."
"This is the top end of the market in Moraira, so its not cheap."
But it does represent excellent value for money.
The Art Deco interior is worth of mention as well.
So Piscis is somewhere we are happy to return to time after time.
A worthwhile place to stop and rest.
Every time I have eaten here I have enjoyed both the quality and presentation of the food.
Makes a change from the pizza parlours and burger joints that are frequently to be found in this pretty port.
Worth every Euro!
"Went to Restuarant in July 2008, Prices very expensive for what you get."
"also Portions very small indeed, so rather disappointing, certainly not worth the prices they charge."
There are much better quality/ value restaurants in Puerto Pollensa.
One to avoid
"It's a classic of the area, but it is a bit overrated and far too crowded."
"The food is certainly good, but you have to wonder if it's worth the waiting time to get a table, given that there are many bars of comparable quality nearby"
People were queing to get in.
"Not sure why, service was good but although food was ok it was not comparable with other places and was expensive."
Try the Dubliner for a pizza - fantastic.
"was very sick after eating chicken in this place could,nt go out at all"
Can't believe this place isn't more highly rated...
I had a fabulous evening here having followed a Guide Rouge Bib Gourmand recommendation... and wasn't disappointed.
The chef and the rest of the staff were very attentive and the set menu was hugely satisfying.
I would urge people to try it.
I booked this restaurant prior to travelling to Cala d'Or for a special evening for my boyfriend and myself.
I emailed my request to the restaurant for a table for 2 directly overlooking the marina.
The restaurant was very quick to reply and confirm my reservation and said I would have a table at the side of the restaurant with a view over the harbour.
We were both really looking forward to the evening and are both seasoned travellelers accustomed to fine dining.
Well things went downhill from the moment we walked through the door.
The table was not on the side of the harbour and when asked if we could move to a table which was free on that side of the restaurant the waiter said he had to ask the manager.
The manager said no without any explanation.
We also found the manager very umwelcoming and extremely rude.
He took our order and we had the feeling we were being hurried so that he could get the table back for the next couple he had booked in.
He basically told us we could only have the short tasting menu!!
The staff never smiled or even explained what the food was they brought to the table.
When I order the tasting menu I usually find it helpful to be told what each dish actually is.
The cutlery was filthy and my boyfriends water glass was chipped.
Not exactly what you would expect for a top class restaurant.
The food was relatively good but not really of a top class fine dining standard.
If you look at all the awards you will see they are pretty dated.
This restaurant is living from a name it made for itself sometime ago but no longer deserves.
"I would definately not recommend it and would advise you to go the Aquarius restaurant just down from here for a nicer atmoshere, really good food at decent prices and very friendly staff who don't treat you like you are sitting in McDonalds."
Price you paid was definately for location and not much else.
Have eaten in other Little Italy's and have had a reasonable enough meal.
The one is PP is little more than a cafe.
Waiters were surly and the food was very average.
"They did not serve garlic bread, only garlic pizza and the only rose wine on the wine list was pink lambrusco at 12euro a bottle!"
Felt it was a bit of a rip-off I'm afraid.
Want a special meal?
Then try this place on the Javea to Benitachell road.
There is a fantastic selection of meat and fish dishes and the service is friendly and very efficient.
Try the steak-on-stone.
"You cook this yourself on a slab of hot granite, on your table."
"Or, try the sea bass baked in a crust of salt."
"The ambience is extremely conducive to dining, be it eating inside or on the terrace."
Dress smart casual.
"Expect to pay circa €50 to €60 per head for an apperitif, a three course meal, a bottle of medium priced wine and a coffee.."
El Churra provided an authentic meal of food typical to the Murcia region.
We went during the mid meal time (the biggest meal of the day for Spaniards) and asked our waiter for recommendations.
He took over and provided the best meal I have ever eaten.
"We had a small portion of paella, a plate of roasted vegetables, a bacalo (light fish) and tomato dish, stuffed artichokes with fish roe (I was skeptical of this one, but it was mouth watering), lecha (a common fish of the mar menor), lamb, dessert, two bottles of Jumilla wine and coffee."
The entire meal cost about $75 per person.
We were there celebrating so cost wasn't an issue.
They also have a menu that you can order from that offers many of the items that we had and more.
"If you prefer a set menu, they have a typical menu del dia."
"Wandering around the streets of Sevilla in search of a pricy seafood restaurant recommended by our hotel, we stumbled upon El Cordobes, in a small plaza."
"They offered a ""prix fixe"" dinner which included your selection of several entrees in addition to appetizer and bread, and wine."
"It was very reasonable, and the maitre d' called out to us to come in, so we did."
"They have outdoor seating in a lovely courtyard with lights in the trees, but we chose to sit inside because it was a bit too cool for me (probably around 55F or so)."
"We had absolutely delicious paella and rabo de toro, with a lovely bottle of wine that we will try to find here in the United States."
"The restaurant was very slow that evening, even though it was a Friday night (maybe we went out earleir than others, and there were a fair number of people out in the courtyard area), so our waiter, who was very friendly and informative, came and spoke with us about Sevilla, the fair, and anything else we wanted to know."
"The meal was slow paced, but not too slow, and delicious."
And it was one of our cheapest meals in Spain!
Lobster cannelloni (cold) and a lovely salad to share (more than enough).
Followed by a molten chocolate pudding with ice cream also to share.
"A bottle of rose wine, water, and two Illy coffees."
Total 37 Euros.
Excellent value and (unusually) friendly service.
Worth looking for.
Fab brunches.
Best monkfish in town
"Expensive, but the place to be."
"Nice food, good music and lovely atmosphere."
The Olive Tree is located just off the Moraira to Calpe coast road about 3 km from the centre of Moraira.
They also run The Olive Deli in Moraira’s main street where there is an economically-priced menu of the day plus a variety of hot and cold dishes to eat in or take away.
"There is no a la carte at The Olive Tree, you can choose from the restaurant’s set price menu that changes seasonally."
"The interior of the restaurant is fresh and modern bar area, high quality linen on the tables."
Cooking was good with innovative dishes well presented.
So why am I not a regular?
Its the attitude.
"We felt second class customers as the staff concentrated on a few obviously regular customers, and as new faces we were made to feel unwanted."
We gave the restaurant two chances and had the same experience both times.
"I am afraid I want to enjoy the whole experience of an evening out, and its not just the food."
Myself and my husband spent a lovely evening at the Bistro Mar.
This restaurant has a very easy going and relaxed ambience.
It was lovely to sit outdoors watching the sun going down over the marina and passers by stroll along soaking up the atmosphere.
This restaurant appears to be popular with couples and families alike.
The staff are very welcoming.
"There was a family with young children sitting near us and the staff were wonderful in offering assistance, sorting out seating etc."
The food itself was wonderful.
The menu is well priced and I would definetly recommend the sea bass.
There is also an excellent wine list.
"I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any lover of seafood and to anyone who likes to sit back, relax and watch the world go by!"
Taller de Tapas is in a lively area (El Born area) and you will have a perfectly enjoyable meal here.
"However, it feels like every generic tapas place in the U.S., there are no creative surprises on the menu and is certainly not an authentic tapas experience."
It is the perfect tapas place for families with young kids or those with finicky palates.
"If you are in this area, I recommend Cheese Me, which is just across the square and equally appealing to the American palate but has more inventive dishes and saving your tapas experience for another more authentic place."
"Fantastic food, very good wine list."
Nice waiters.
"Had liver, lamb, beef, fish."
Everything was really good.
One of the best places I have been to in Spain.
Not cheap but worth every penny.
"Incredible food, incredible service...Everything here is DELICIOUS!"
"The place is always packed, but definitely worth the wait (they do not take reservations) Get there hungry, so you can order as much as possible... Bon appétit !"
"Delicious ""menu degustacio"" and ask for a coffe too."
Hi guys this is the 2nd restaurant i have tried from Trip Advisor in the top 5 which is closed for the whole of Aug every Aug.
So i have no idea what it is like shame other users don't put up times it is open and closed to help fellow travellers.
"Its on the door, also when it is open its closed every Mon and Sat night and on festive days."
It opens 13:00 to 16:30 amd 19:00 to 22:30.
Best tapas in Barca
Fantastic restaurant recommended to us by some locals.
Cool décor and great service.
There are no translated menus or English speaking staff so make sure you know how to ask for a rare steak before you go!
"We had a couple of delicious starters followed by a chateux briand shared between 2 and a great Rioja, total cost about €75."
"Recommended by one of the staff at our hotel (Hotel Arts), this is a great place."
"Tapas in a modern setting, you can see them cooking and sit at the food bar."
"Friendly staff, the best tomato bread we had all week and very good value."
Would recommend unconditionally
"I went by myself, which isn't ideal."
"Because each dish is really just a small taste of something marvelous, you need to have > 1 person at your table if you want to have a reasonable selection of items without overeating."
Still it would be fun with if you went with company.
They're very snotty and overrated.
WIll turn single and colored people away by pretending to be 'booked.'
They refused to seat me both times that I came in because I was alone.
I made such a big deal about it that she FINALLY gave me a seat .... at the damn bar.... with an attitude.
Is the place really going to fill up in the half hour that I'm there???
They don't like to seat single people because its less money for them which is so incredibly stupid.
They pretend they're booked when they want to refuse you...
The food was so - so not great and very over priced.
My salmon roll had a small bone in it and when I alerted them to it they acted like I put in there myself...The service isn't all that efficient and really not worth the money..
I've had way better sushi in NY.
"Besides, who wants to deal with such BS on their vacation for one lousy meal?"
"I learned two lessons from eating here: always trust your instincts when choosing a restaurant, and never go to the first place you see just because you're hungry."
"I didn't like the look of this restaurant, but ate there anyway."
"I should have taken five minutes to go further into the town, and I would have found many restaurants that looked a lot nicer."
"The service was extremely slow throughout our meal, culminating in a 20 minute wait to get our bill, despite asking two different members of staff."
"The food was unpleasant: endives tasted sour and came with pear and Roquefort that had none of the fresh crispness they should, all mixed up in an overly rich sauce."
Salami pizza was edible but greasy.
The whole thing came to 21 euros: more than we paid a few days before for an excellent lunch in Arta.
Avoid.
While we were greeted by a stuck up sommelier the rest of the attentive service followed by amazing food and wine made up for it.
We casually even chatted up with the head chef on the way out.
"The decor is a little odd, but if its warm out be sure to ask for a table on the terrace."
This is a Pinchos Bar - the Catalonian version of Tapas.
If you love snacky food like Tapas you will adore this place.
"This bar is located in the Barri Gotic, in the same alley as the Picasso Museum and close to Santa Maria del Mar church."
"We discovered it early in our stay, and went back several times."
"We were amused one lunchtime to see dozens of tourists come up and read the menu outside, then walk away without realising what they were missing ... because Pinchos is a real experience."
"What happens is this: The owners perpare dozens of different platters, each full of little portions (called 'racions') of one type of tasty morsel pinned to a little slice of fresh-baked bread by a toothpick or small plastic sword."
"There may be one platter of salmon, another of sardines, or meat, or prawns, or cheese, and even a range of vegetarian pinchos - everything you can imagine."
"Walk in and grab a table, then when you're ready to eat simply go to the bar and pick up an empty plate from the stack."
Then you walk along the bar and put anything you fancy from these platters of food onto your own plate.
When you've finished eating take your plate to the cash register and the girl behind the bar simply counts the number of coloured toothpics and charges you accordingly.
It costs just a few Euros per 'racion de Pinchos' (portion) depending on whether you chose something cheap like egg or something expensive like lobster ... some 'racions' cost more than others.
None of them cost very much.
"In that regard, it's like the Catalan version of a sushi train, and it's delicious."
"The bar also serves wine, or soft drinks if you like."
We really loved this place.
Friendly - delicious.
"Down the road there are often long queues at the Picasso Museum, which is over-rated and over-priced."
I have better memories of a good lunch or two and a genuine Catalonian experience at the Euskal Extea.
"Very good restaurant with fresh food and good atmosphere, specially for a romantic dinner."
What a superb restaurant!
Great food in a friendly and intimate environment.
So close to the tourist routes and yet never felt touristy at all - for Barcelona that's pretty amazing!
"Good food, and with a nice balcony view over Calle San Míguel."
Geri Halliwell sat at the table next to ours...
"Piccolo's is a wee gem, with quirky seating and friendly staff and of course a great view of the beach!"
Great place for a meal or just snacks and of course a cold beer!
We have an apartment in Calahonda so are regular visitors to the area.
"Although this is the 'sister' restaurant to Villa Paradiso, sharing the same menu, we prefer its location."
The food is always of a high quality and the service exceptional.
"A really nice restaurant, on the front near the Torre in Moraira."
This place manages to deliver what so many restaurants struggle to deliver and rarely manage to.
"The food is fresh, home cooked and imaginative."
The service is friendly and personal - the owners serve in the restaurant.
And perhaps the best bit is that it is superb value for money - you can get out at around 35 euros a head if you take the set menu and half a bottle of house wine.
"Apart from dinner, it is open during the day as a cafe, when you can sit outside and admire the passing people."
"The owners are Dutch, but speak other languages like the ubiquitous English fluently."
"The majority of the customers are Dutch, but as non Dutch I have never felt unwelcome, quite the opposite."
"My advice is don't delay, book a table right now and enjoy yourself."
"La Meridiana is gorgeous, the food amazing & the service is first rate."
This is a very high end place to eat our bill for 2 was 300+ euros.
They advertise that they have great nightclub next door at the club VANITY.
Be very very careful if you go here.
The door guys are rude and VERY VERY shaddy.
If you need a cab the arab door man will call one of his buddys (the equivalant to a gipsy cab).
"Do not get in this car, it is nothing but trouble."
If you ask for a regular white Taxi he will act like he does not speak english.
Over all STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE !!!!
!
"I had passed by the exterior of the restaurant whilst sightseeing during the day and decided to look up the website prior to arriving - www.restaurantvinomio.com Helene, the owner from Holland originally, has extensive hospitality experience and her English is excellent."
The menu caters for the international traveller and presentation was excellent.
"I had a dish of Argentinian beef with seasonal vegetables and as an Australian, I was very impressed with the standard of beef."
"Also, as a solo traveller I had a house vino tinto, which exceeded expectations."
"The surroundings are very comfortable offering sit down dining, high tables or stools at the bar, with a separate room to the side for smokers."
The only criticism which I did pass onto Helene was that the waiter did not ask how I would like the beef prepared and did not offer a steak knife... but minor issues.
"The restaurant also offers Salsa, Jazz and Flamenco nights."
Do not arrive before 9.30pm as the Spanish choose to dine from 10pm onwards.
"Main meal 10-17 Euro's, house wine 3 Euro's per glass."
"We dined here twice this holiday... not the most inexpensive place, but it offers great food and an excellent service."
So what you get is value for money.
Easy cool and quiet sophistication aptly describes this wonderful restaurant come bar in Barcelona's trendy Born district.
"With an elegant interior and comfortable furnishing, the world weary traveller will be well at home in La Luna, sipping the best mojito outside Havana."
"Owned by two Irish Public Schoolboys, La Luna is the quintessential launch pad for a sizzling night on the town, or just a place for a quiet intimate drink with one of the dazzling girls that frequent this temperate establishment."
"La Luna is one of the best kept secrets in the Catalan capital, but word of mouth has spread its reknown with the occasional off duty celebrity poking their nose around the corner for a light meal without being molested by an assortment of well wishers and trophy hunters."
"Located near Santa Maria del Mar, La Luna takes a little finding at first, but once found, never to be forgotten."
"The service is professional and unobtrusive, with the obliging waiters (who all speak English) only too happy to assist."
"If in Barcelona, search it out and you will be justly rewarded."
We visited La Palette on our first night in Menorca.
We were very impressed with the food and the staff were very friendly.
The only criticism was the (outside) cheap plastic patio chairs which wern't very comfy and didn't reflect the prices.
We paid 160 euros for four including drinks.
The menu was quite wide and the food well presented.
There was a children's menu available too.
We would list this restaurant in the top three or four that we tried in Cala n Porter.
First impression was cautious.
Seemed like a tourist trap.
Little English is spoken.
"The waiter was somewhat overbearing and ""too friendly."""
Turned out it was the real deal.
"The drinks and appetizers that were offered ""complimentary"" really were."
"The meals were authentic country dishes (good selection of seafood, lamb, pork, sausages), and the prices were very reasonable."
We enjoyed their hospitality on three occasions during our visit to Madrid.
eat here every time i come best gambas in town try the oxtail stew excellent
We had 3 lovely meals here.
It is not cheap but the quality of food and service are so good.
"The first time we sat outside but it was quite windy, so we went inside for the other visits."
Staff were really helpful and were giving blankets and sweaters to young children who were getting cold siting outside.
"It was always busy, mostly with French and Spanish tourists."
"We were always given a glass of cava when we sat down along with olives, anchovy bread and tomato bread."
At the end of the meal we had home made petits fours.
The food is excellent - it was very hard to choose our favourites dishes but the gazpacho with tomato ice cream tasted really fresh.
We will be back here again.
I'm a regular visitor to Caleta de Fuste and Fado Rock is the best steak house in town.
"Be careful when you go though, as quite often you'll have to queue to get in."
It has a great reputation.
The choice of food available is superb.
The steaks are great but so is everything else.
Especially the seafood platter which my fiance tried.
It was massive.
"The service is second to none, you never have to pour your own glass of wine."
They are fantastic.
"Please, if you're visiting Caleta, make sure you give Fado Rock a try."
I've been to Fuerteventura more than a dozen times since 2004 when my family bought a house in Caleta and always make a bee-line for this place as soon as I get off the plane!
"The food is amazing, the service is great and it's not extortionate either."
"If you want a lovely meal in wonderful surroundings, this is the place to come!"
nice and clean macdonalds on the road between airport and costa calma
"My partner and I, who are total foodies, decided to choose Massana as our treat on our recent trip."
"We were a little surprised to see its location, near the railway line in a less than beautiful street."
"However, appearances can be deceptive and the incognito facade hides a swish interior."
"Some of the dining area is split into glass screened areas, in a modern, clean style."
I didn't particularly like the decor but it has been done to a high standard.
On entering the restaurant my partner and I realised instantly we were underdressed.
The waiting staff were dressed in black tie.
I would recommend not wearing jeans to this restaurant.
The service was very good.
We had chosen the tasting menu which comprises of ten courses with accompanying wines.
I complained that I felt rushed after the second course because it was a little too speedy between finishing one and starting the next course.
The waitress was apolgetic and actioned a slower approach instantly.
The food at this restaurant is quite simply world-class.
I am very surprised this establishment does not have a Michelin Star.
"They most certainly deserve one with an imaginative, varied and sumptuous menu."
Take your wallet and make sure it's full but don't regret spending a single penny as this restaurant will guarantee satisfaction for your palate.
"Pretty good food, very touristy menu though."
We visited the Villa Tiberio again recently in July and enjoyed our 2nd visit even more than the first.
Our waiters were extremely attentive and were very impressed with the whole experience.
This restaurant is always busy so they must be doing something right as it is not cheap but it is an opportunity to get dressed up to go out as everyone makes an effort unlike so many restaurants nowadays.
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy good food and service in a fabulous setting.
We were recommended this restaurant by Spanish friends of ours and I have to admit - I'll be back !!!!
It is located in the new Plaza del Mar centre in Marbella and is fairly well signposted so easy to find.
"If coming from the Malaga direction drive into centre of Marbella and then turn left by the copper ""pirulin""."
- (the Marbella Conference centre will be on your left.)
Go around the roundabout and drive down road to next crossroads (The Sultan Club should be on your right).
"Turn right at sign for ""Plaza del Mar"" and follow road around to the car park entrance."
Parking is right underneath the plaza and the lift goes straight up to the restaurant level so good access is possible with no steps (if people have mobility problems).
The restaurant itself is a fairly modern contemporary design and would seat maybe 80 people inside but the terrace outside will easily seat over 200 people with great views right over the beach and down the coast.
Good selection of food available on menu - a mix of typical Spanish and international dishes with good portion sizes and excellent presentation.
Certainly the meal we had was all fresh produce and tasted great.
The night we were there we seemed to be the only non Spanish clients (and the terrace was very busy).
"So, if you want to try good Spanish gastronomy this is the place to go."
"Pricing would be mid range for good restaurants in the area (we had 3 bottles of wine plus drinks on arrival and after dinner) so our bill would not maybe considered to be the ""normal"" -(Yes, it was a good night )!"
- so I would estimate a normal price per head would be approx.
45 - 50 Euro.
As the terrace is overlooking the sea the guys will be fine but the girls would probably need a wrap if out on the terrace late at night.
nice and cheap Chinese in the middle of Playa
Country side food from Northwest Spain.
"Nice looking place, next door to a cheap tapas place."
Sat outside.
Shielded from the road and next door by small trees in tubs gives it a sort of intimate feel.
Spoilt by finding a piece of sticker still on the apple slice in our main course dish (both of us).
When we pointed it out we were given a very soggy fruit cocktail as an apology!
Waitress was trying too hard.
If you want to take out a second mortgage they are one of a few places in Spain that serve Kobe beef- glad we didn't go for it!
Definitely not worth the 187 euros my wife paid for the last meal of our holiday
"Food is great, rock mussels and of course the rice."
In one of the best Formentera beaches.
We were aiming for the place opposite which was recommended in our guide book but it was closed.
Civera was a lovely place in a narrow passage with tables on both sides of the pavement.
"Expansive menu, attentive but not over so waiters."
Would go back
We really enjoyed our meal at Can Majo.
A tip - skip everything else on the menu and just order the Paella.
It is delicious and filling.
We had ordered lobster salad (good) and a few shrimp dishes (ok) in addition to the Paella (excellent).
"The other dishes did not compare, we were full by the time the Paella came and still finished our plates because it was sood good."
We took the leftovers from the pan home and ate the next day (even better).
"When you go, don't take a cab."
Get off at the Barceloneta metro stop and walk along the pier / beach to the restaurant.
It's a nice walk and we saw a terrific street band on our way.
I have had my best ravioli so far at this restaurant.
=P
"After walking past Fat Sam's a a few times and seeing how busy it always was, we new we had to eat there!"
It's set right opposite the great beach at Santa Ponsa in Mallorca.
"We got there and it was very busy, resulting in no tables."
"So, we sat down in the waiting area and had a beer and looked at the menu."
I'd best desribe it as a toned down TGI Fridays / Frankie and Bennie's.
It's an American themed resturant with everything from a wax work of Maralyn Monroe (with the skirt blowing) to road signs on the wall.
The Menu was easy to read and very appealing.
"They had all the ""typical American grub"" on it."
From Hog dogs to bugers.
"We visited there twice and on both occassions me and my girlfriend picked the same meal (I know, us Manc's aren't very adventurous)."
I went with a Cheese Burger and she went for Chicken in a cheese sauce.
I must say both of them were lovely.
"The Burger (which took 20 minutes to come, as advised on the menu) was so tasty and topped of with gratted cheese (nice change from processed)."
The chips were fantastic too.
My girlfriend's chicked (which I had a taste) was so succulent too.
"To top it off, we got to see the sun disappear over the mountains."
"Definately go to Fat Sam's as the food is gorgeous, the location great and the staff very friendly!"
!
Several years ago I went to this place and had been looking forward to a great meal.
What a disappointment!
I guess the chain syndrome has cought up with them.
"Great location, terrible service from the parking attendant to the waiter, the cashier and every person we encountered there."
Extremely expensive for what you get.
The food was overcooked and badly seasoned.
Avoid at all costs.
The location is beautiful but don’t waist your money for it.
I felt so bad for my aunts who invited us and had to pay this huge bill for such a poor meal and bad service.
"Avoid, Avoid!!!"
!
"Good fried anchovies, tortilla normal ... simple and comfortable."
From the outside it looked really nice and the food that people ate looked really nice as well.
Our starters (gazpacho and beef carpaccio) were good but the main courses were downright disgusting.
"My boyfriend had ordered ""noodles Taragona style"" not exactly knowing what they were because the waiter's English was very poor and our Spanish even poorer."
"But he was told that ""it is the way it is cooked and it is very nice"" so he took the chance."
"When the food arrived we found out that it was paella with pasta instead of rice, but paella with overcooked mussels and a horrible odeur."
Yuck!
"I ordered one of the chef's reccomendations: two types of fish with spinach, prawns and a cava sauce."
It sounded lovely but the dish most resembled something that had come out of the kitchen in a restaurant in the former Soviet Union.
"To large chunks of boiled fish smothered in a thick, yellow sauce."
Yuck again!
Needles to say we left everything but satisfied.
"Not far from La Rambla (10 minute walk), located on the Paralel (seconds from the Tryp Apolo Theater & Hotel )."
A small and lovely decorated restaurant with romantic overtones but still wonderful for a group or family.
"Lovely service (and yes, they speak English) with a smile and patience to explain everything."
I was told it is the place where the Barcelona Soccer team goes when they want a great piece of (South American style) meat and WOW - you get that here!
"We went back twice during the few days in Barcelona, not only for the main course but the Sangria was THE BEST we tasted throughout our trip."
Don't miss it!
Reservations are recommended due to the size and local demand.
"It is not cheap, but worth every Euro !"
"Cavernous, brash and lacking the sort of ambiance I am looking for."
"The restaurant is located just off the main Moraira to Teulada road, a couple of miles from Moraira."
You need to keep an eye open for it on the left hand side of the road.
The name Ca la Iaia is the Valencian language for ‘Granny’s House’.
The restaurant is open lunch times after 13.30 and evenings from 19.00 hrs.
In the summer you can sit outside for your evening meal.
"The food and service, I found middle of the road, and when I sought to put value for money on the restaurant it was ""average""."
"One is spoiled in Moraira with a great many restaurants, so unless one actually comes out on the upper side of ""average"" for at least something, then I am unlikely to be tempted to return."
"I am sure they have there loyal and regular clientele, and if the local selection of other restaurants was not so good, I am sure I would have returned."
The biggest sandwiches in the city!
"Fast but qualified food, plenty of tables to seat and fast and efficent service!"
"Great ""patatas bravas""!"
"If you are not going any time soon to the north of Spain then Lizarran, a chain restaurant that serves pinchos, will have to do."
I will not say that it is top of the line quality food but it is fun and quick.
"They use a self serving method where you are given a plate, you choose your picks from plates on top of the bar and hold onto the different shaped toothpicks that are stuck into each pincho."
At the end the toothpicks are counted and you are charged accordingly.
Ideal Japanese restaurant for those who like eating sushi non-stop!
;)
You can eat god meal in this place.
Don´t forget ask about payoyo cheesse.
good service for few money.
The Best food Catalana and Very liked Pan tomaca the world
"Nice place for a business meal, great menu (16 EUR including wine and coffee)."
"Nice place for kids, Basque cuisine and plenty of calories in each dish!"
Outstanding kokotxas!
!
Very good and cheap food and wine!
"Nice, lovely place!"
How can this Japanese restaurant be bad.
It is situated in the gardens of a 5 Star hotel and is judged by frequent Japanese travelers.
"If you are not too hungry and need a quiet escape from the local fair, this is your retreat."
Good salads and quick service in rush hour.
"Good Italian one... Tasty and nice pizzas, with fast and good service and just in the middle of the city!!!"
Maybe too noisy sometimes...
Good quality for its price.
"Nice atmosphere, nice tapas."
Very nice daily menu!
"really excellent traditional,  may appear old fashioned but the quality is top"
New taste in Barcelona.
Delicious fusion with main thai accent.
Excellent but a bit overprized winelist.
Best thai in town
The best tomatoes in the city!
Delicious monkfish with fresh tomato vinegar!
one of the greatest places i have ever been!
very simple but perfect!
Brilliant place.
Always made to feel welcome and very friendly staff.
"Sometimes when very busy it can be a wait, but well worth it."
there is no best dessert; their fried banana is the best EVER!
I like this place much more than caravanserai.
"Good service, excellent bocadillos, and some stunning rice dishes here!!!"
You can have lunch and dinner outside in summer...
I like it!
If you are hungry and dont have a lot of money to spend ... this is your place.
Just be prepared to wait for outdoor seating and keep in mind there may be seating inside in the dining cave in the back.
Nice cuisine with good and balanced menus.
"Maybe too short in rice and drinks, and quite little desserts to choose."
Eating at the Corte Ingles is painful.
Only if I need a pick me up (juice or coffee) do I come here and even so I always regret it.
"It is not the food that is horrible, although it is nothing special, it is the painfully slow service."
It kills me everytime to watch them fiddle around trying to figure out how to efficiently wait tables.
"Amazing location,friendly service and local product cooked with a intresting twist.."
3 stars in Michelin guide.
An old house with magic inside.
A table in the kitchen that you can reserve and eat while the cooks work.
You will need budget!!
!
just go with the flow and enjoy your meal.
i made a good choise: my food was delicious
"Nice Mexican Food, near Plaza Mayor, with colourful decoration and nice dishes, like ""alambre"", ""tacos"" and, of course, ""margaritas""."
Maybe too small for those tables...
"We went for the paella on a recommendation from Lonely Planet, and it was utterly awful."
"Too salty, and NOT good!"
We had the best paella at the daily market in St. Remy de Provence in France!
"Pedro Subijana is for me the best of the 4 basque ""aces"""
This is an IT place to eat.
"However, this small tapas bar drives me crazy."
"If you are lucky enough to find a table (most are outside seating only, put your name on the waiting list if you can get the waiter's attention), be prepared to wait and wait some more for your food."
I never really understand why I go here.
The food is alright but still doesnt compensate for the slow kitchen.
The wait staff at least have patience and humor when it comes to their snail paced kitchen.
"Mexico, it is not."
typical catalan food
"small but excellent restaurant, ingredients are top class, pitty of neighbourhood"
We should bear in mind that not so many people like this kind of food...
"However, bringing here some of my mates meant breaking this ""rule"" and introducing them into the fascinating world of uncommon and amazing new flavours!"
XD
Fast mex.
Plenty of food and big hamburgers prepared with real and healthy beef.
"Maybe too big and too smelly, but ideal for kids!"
You can have as much pepsi as you want...
"great view, good meals..."
If you want to discover the exact opposite of El Bulli.
One of the 5 best meals of my life.
To get the best deal try this restaurant during the week at lunch time when they have a prefixed menu for under 7 euros.
Come slightly before the 2:30 rush to get a seat.
The staff is hospitable and the food is good.
For fun watch the locals struggle with their chop sticks.
just average.
It used to be an italian reference!
One great sandwich: Campero.
"You can choose chicken, bacon, ham..."
"It's superb, with a delicious round-bread."
It's a pity it's very small and difficult to get some space there!
Buenas tapas...
Fashion
good tapas and drinks for reasonable prices
Very nice restaurant.
"Good ambiance, good music."
"Good food, very nice service and low prices."
A place to go.
it's the best restaurant ever i've visit.
"nice place, too crowed sometimes but great fun and place to be."
if you want to be on a relaxed atmosphere go to the one in av.
"sarria, same place, same wine list, 'truita amb l'ou dins'... amazing!"
This place has been popular among the young (non meat eating) tourists for quite sometime.
Vegetarian has always been difficult to find in Seville and despite many changes in the city ham remains to be regarded as a vegetable.
"Habanita has responded to this need with warm indoor and outdoor spaces, serving cuban inspired tapas that appeal to vegetarians and meatetarians."
"Finish your meal with a honey rum, yum."
I would like to see an updated menu and some small renovations to the place.
I am never real impressed by this place but they give you a good amount of food and offer mexican and Italian type fair.
It is good for big groups.
A place where people go.
This place is always packed so be prepared to stand and wait and then be squished into a small dining space.
The food is good and the experience is Sevillian.
best italian in... Spain
"the best hamburger,  the best cocktails with natural fruit"
bon xines.
I remember nothing else of that night but the best frozen strawberry margaritas I've ever tasted
"A nice place, just in the town center... but I don't like it very much."
"The service is a bit unpolite, the coffee is bad and expensive."
Just prefer the bar located just near this one!
"really good,but expensive"
Extremely expensive.
The waiter pushed food on us that we did not want.
This after waiting half an hour.
This is a total tourist trap.
Bit touristy but good meat dishes and earthy smells.
JLR Score 35/50
Best place in Gijon for italian food and if you get a table at the window you hav a nice view to the marina haven.
"Nice place, non-smoker restaurant with wonderful sights."
"Nice service, good traditional food and a superb lunch-menu on Sundays!"
This place is situated on the Alameda.
"It is a great back up place when all the other tapas places are filled or when you just want a quick, cheap, tapa fast."
They have a great selection of traditional tapas.
"This self serve place is good for Pepitos (sandwiches with peppers, ham and pork), ensaladilla rusa (potato salad), Solomillo al roquefort (pork with roquefort cheese), and fried baby squids....."
This place is not for those on a fat free diet.
So you want to go where the locals go and really see the colors of Seville.... then you found your place.
Locals and tourist mix here.
El Rinconcillo is an antique gem.
To get the real flavor stand downstairs and enjoy their traditional tapas.
My favorites are their cheese and the espinacas con garbonzos.
"Typical Catalan food, good quality, a good choice when your friends prefer to eat something as if they ""stayed at home "", not ""strange"" XD"
Good food in a good place.
But I think it is extremely expensive for what I had there.
Enormous wine list!
!
"Most important: you need a reservation, unless you are some sort of VIP."
The food is excellent.
If you are looking for the usual Spanish Dishes ... go elsewhere.
"But if you are looking for fresh food, composed with fantasy and spanish temperament and class this is the right spot."
Enjoy!
This is a great local joint in the Porvenir.
"Many locals come here so much that the waiters will bring them things before they even order, knowing their like and dislikes."
"Try the salmorejo, the fish, the croquetas, anything is good."
"This great place is a bit hidden and off the beaten track for tourists, hidden behind the Cruz Roja (The Red Cross) in the Macarena."
"It is popular among local ""pijos"" (upper middle class folk that dress their children in nickers and bows)."
"If you can find a seat or dont mind standing, this place serves up beautiful fish dishes."
It is well worth the work getting there and the money that you will spend.
traditional but one of the best in town
This is a pizza joint popular among the Spanish youth.
Not good or bad.
"Good food, a nice place for lunch."
Trust the proprietor to provide a seletion of tapas.
"Don't trust his aperitif, though :-)."
the best japanese in Madrid
"I tend to eat the local specialities when i'm away,but this American Diner just stood out.Very quick and ascertive staff,very good prices for the huge portions you were given.I'f you're hungry,this is the place for you."
but very expensive
the food here is fantastic.
Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge portions as well.
Great value for money
The best place for pintxos.
"Great ""brocheta de gambas"", superb ""chipirones a la plancha"", tasty ""guindillas"", spicy ""pincho moruno""."
"Excellent service, clean, non-smoking and must seen!"
Locals love to come here for the fresh on going selection of seafood and spacious dining area.
You can either order tapas at the bar or choose your favorite shellfish at thier market style display.
By no means is this a classy joint but you will eat well.
Excellent vegetarian food!
Must order the croquettes and the house wine is not too shabby.
Quiet and quaint atmosphere.
Sorry Matthew with two T's but maybe we can agree to disagree.
This is one of my favorite places.
Waiters here are authentic from these parts and can be interpreted as being rude but that is how it is my friend.
They aren't going to compliment you on your lovely shirt to get a bigger tip.
The portions are not big but the food in my opinion is wonderful.
"I love the magret de pato (duck), pate de cabracho (a fish mousse) and the fried camembert cheese."
You will probably have to fight for a table or a small spot on the bar but luckily the time stands still in this bar since the wall clock always reads the same time.
If your wish is die by eating this restaurant is for you.
The portions of paella and fried fish would create problems for an elephant.
Prices are good.
Good pasta and quiches.
Reasonable price an dgreat scene.
"In fact, Adoni is much more provocative than Ferran Adria"
This is a fantastic restaurant and very reasonably if you want it to be.
Excellent service and unique food.Everyone I have taken there has recommended it to others
"Excellent paellas, and a large variety."
The duck paella has to be ordered the day before.
"Good service, and delicious starters."
"Once you eat a real paella, you will never want to try the stodge they give you in most other places"
"Great food, real Belgian french fries!"
Ask a table as close to the beachside as possible!
Time to relax!
Surely the best steaks in the area - we are regular customers.
"May be busy, so book or be patient...."
My dad has lived in Cabo Roig for 5 years and i have been every year since then.
It has changed a lot over the years but i love it.
It is about 15-20 minutes away from Murcia airport and under an hour from Alicante airport.
Torrevieja is close by about 20-30 minutes away which is a big town with a good market that is on most nights of the week.
Cabo Roig itself is basically a long strip of bars and restaurants with lots of apartments and villas around.
There are lots of beaches near by within walking distance.
"As i said, lots of restaurants to suit all tastes."
"Green Chilli is a great indian there, there are a couple of wok buffets over the road from the main strip, lots of italians and pizza restaurants and some cafes and chip shop type places."
If you cross the main road and walk down a bit u can get to the more spanishy areas which is also a bit cheaper!
"There are loads of bars there with a karaoke on every night in most places, you can always find one!"
"The Trinity Pub located just down one of the side strips is a favourite of locals and holiday makers and The Bushwacka keeps getting bigger every year, literally!"
They are extending it now to make it bigger and better!
It is my favourite place to go!
Cabo Roig is conveniently located by lots of places.
Campoamor is the next urbanisation over which is a bit more spanishy.
Just up the road is La Zenia which has some good bars and a bit further up the N332 (i think it is) is Playa Flamenca (Flamenca Beach) which has lots of good bars too.
Villa Martin is also a bit further down and has a good carvery restaurant.
There are lots of big supermarkets located close by and taxis that arent too expensive.
On the strip there is a British supermarket which sells everything (at the back of the strip) and there are also chinese nick nack shops!
Near by is a go kart track and quad biking and there are various watersports a the beaches you can do.
I have holidayed here and also lived there for a few months this summer so i have perspective from both sides.
I would say the main season starts mid-june and can last until end of sept mid oct.
There is lots to do for a holiday and u cant really get bored of the strip in a week.
"We ventured more to Playa Flamenca when we fancied a change, but we always ended up back at Bushwacka until kicking out time at about 3.30 then went to Trinity until 4am."
There is also a Pacha club in Torrevieja which is open in summer til 6am.
You could also take a day trip to Benidorm where its cheaper and has lots ofthings to do.
Terra Mitica is great.
Terra Natura is good for kids with dolphin shows and sealion show and parrott shows and lots of animals etc.
Mundo Mar is a huge water park there too.
There is also a water park in Torrevieja called Aquapolis.
I'd say this place is ok for families because all the accomodation has pools and beaches nearby and there is a big shopping centre in Torrevieja called the Habaneras which is great and there is a cinema and arcade so theres something to do.
The Calypo Bar across the main road is great for kids (not great for teenagers or young adults!!!)
but bars that allow smoking inside dont allow kids in after 9pm or 10pm so that can be a problem.
All in all its a great place to visit.
Also my dad does airport transfers and does a taxi service to supermarkets etc and can also get accomodation so drop me a message if you want any details or have any more questions!
"Very good, high class, nice food and wine, fantastic Service!"
This restaurant isn't cheap but the food is delicious.
"Having sampled some unremarkable food in Seville, this was like arriving in heaven."
The waiter was attentive but not intrusive and made some really good recommendations especially the House Salad.
My husband had a delicious meal of Ox Tail and he said it was fabulous.
I had lamb.
A truly memorable and delicious meal.
Long may you be there.
"We had really overpriced , poor food for lunch there one of the days of the holiday..."
When we returned that evening to use the toilet my girlfriend was abused by the RUDEST Waiter in Spain....for simply not asking to use the toilet .. we will never return
We ate here one night and it had to be the worst restaurant we have ever eaten in.
I thought you can't go wrong with Italian food - but I was wrong!
The pasta was overcooked & looked like it had been cooked hours previously and reheated.
There are plenty of nice restaurants to visit in Puerto Rico and this is not one of them!
Very popular place with tourists Nice decor and atmosphere.
Service good.
Food is reasonable but not special and over priced.
There are better places to eat and at a more reasonable price
We have been to El Muelle several times and have never been disppointed.
The service is very friendly and the food is excellent value - the only improvement would be some lovely freshly-cooked vegetables - I know a lot of Spanish restaurants are not hot on veg but the fantastic produce is there in the supermarkets so it must be available.
The steaks in particular are great.
Lovely to find such a genuine place tucked away in a lovely spot well away from the madding crowd.
Great experience.
Outstanding tapas at very reasonable prices.Highlight is the plate with Jamon iberico and cheese.Very recommendable is the Bomba Picante !
And the Albodingas and the cooked mussels and ...
Try it out !
This is a fantastic restauarant based in the north of the island in San Lorenzo.
It is set in a candle lit garden with friendly staff and a buzzing atmosphere.
The food was delicious and there was a great selection of wine.
An added bonus was that there was a boutique with amazing dresses for sale!
Definitely worth the trek.
What a find - we couldn't believe we'd stumbled across this little wine bar when we were trying to avoid the masses.
"The owners, who have moved from Oxford to set up on their own, were brilliant at guiding us through the wine lists and the tapas menu."
Only the best quality makes it through onto their menu and having returned three times in our final four days we can endorse that - fantastic food too.
"We didn't get round to ordering the picnic but what a great idea - half bottle of wine, fruit and a sandwich ready packed for you - perfect for my sort of holiday!"
Visited this restaurant on recommendation from a local friend in Madrid.
"Good location, and great value for money."
"When we first arrived at the restaurant, it looked really expensive, but when we browsed the menu just outside the restaurant, hardly any dishes were above 10 euros."
We ate late (around 10:40pm on a Sunday night) and the place was almost full (there was no waiting required).
"If you want a nice dining experience (good Spanish cuisine, nice atmosphere, minus the service), then this is definitely worth a visit while in Madrid."
We would go back again.
Food very imaginative and well prepared.
Incredibly reasonable prices compared to other more established places.
Decor and atmosphere very nice.
Service very efficient and rapid.
"Go early, very popular with locals."
"This is a must for lunch or dinner and sets the standard for others, irrespective of price"
"Have been here twice, and would go back every time i'm in Spain, food is fantastic and the staff are very helpfull and friendly, its great for couples or families, I love sitting there in the evenings listening to the sound of the frogs which live in the pond there."
Just writing this makes me sad that i'm not there now !
!
"We have just returned, 13/09/2008, from another, been going for 5 years, trip to Fuerteventura and found a new bar / restaurant that has just opened there called Weirdos."
Unlike its name it wasn’t weird but it was very different with a jungle themed bar and elephants everywhere.
The food was just brilliant and very reasonable; we cooked it on a volcanic rock brought to the table.
"We enjoyed it so much we went back for our last night, where they had a band playing everything from Jazz and Blues to Santana; which we were able to enjoy after our meal as they have a separate bar to relax in."
"Great experience thoroughly recommend it, and hope they survive the current economic climate as we are looking forward to going there again in spring."
Best food in Gran Canaria by a mile!
I have argued with the staff that they are undercharging.
"There is no doubt that the passion, the imagination, the attention to detail would not be out of place in London, New York, Paris."
"There is a strong southeast Asian influence, but the food is eclectic, and every dish we have had (which is about 30 by now, over four holidays in 36 months) has been flawless."
"We are going back to Gran Canaria again in January, and we intend to eat in Mundo 7 nights out of 7."
No.8 Bar and Grill is little gem.
Offering something a little different to the other 'samey' places on the strip.
"Contemporary decor, stylish furniture and lovely people who run and work there."
"Thanks to Julian (owner), Heidi and Kerry for our enjoyable evenings, only wish we had found this place sooner."
"The food is wonderful, great portions, and competitively priced recommend the BBQ chicken and sausage and mash and my husband cannot recommend the banoffi pie more highly!!"
!
Just want to add that dinning in No8 Bar and Grill was an experience never to forget.
"The staff Heidi, Michelle, Juilian were so pleasent and helpful made our evening even more special as it was our anniversary."
The chef Tom and Alex produced some of the best food i have ever eaten in a very long while..
I must recommend this dinning area.
"The moment I stepped in this Triana tavern, I loved it."
Its walls drip with Bull fighting posters and other traditional bull fighting decor.
"After the initial wow of the place, one must get down to business and order."
The food will not disappoint.
I love to stand at the bar and savor the oxtail stew with some wine and continue to admire the decor and locals that frequent the joint.
"The toilet tissue used instead of napkins I suppose is an inside joke but one that just adds to the ""charm"" of the place."
"There are three Sol y Sombras side by side, opt for the one closest to the corner but be prepared to stand."
http://www.tabernasolysombra.com/index1.htm
Just wanted to highlight this wee gem.
Found it while wandering around village.
It's down the same steps as El Porton restaurant but is the second terrace.
it has no signage from the main street but sits baove the gardens near the parking area and can be accessed through them.
Run by a French family - very friendly and a good variety of well cooked food at reasonable prices.
Before we left for Spain we booked Cinc Sentits based on a great review we read in the New York Times Travel section almost a year ago.
We were staying in Stiges and took the train into Barcelona.
We were not disappointed.
The food and service were excellent.
Each course from the tasting menu was throughly explained by the attentive staff.
An excellent wine recommendation was made and as we were settling the bill a very attentive women who I assumed was a manager or one of the owners came by our table to thank us for coming in and choosing the restaurant.
She was also very helpful when we were sat with an over view of the menu.
It was a lovely evening and I recommend it highly for anyone who has an adventurous palette.
The tapas were good but the steak was awful more Spanish than most on the island
"If you are in Salobrena, and not vegetarian, this is the place to go."
"The steaks are brought to your table, un cooked."
"You have your own ""hot stone"" and you cut up your steak, and cook it to your liking, as you go on."
The steaks are accompanied by either a jacket potato in foil (a meal in itself!)
"chips, or the most delicious salad."
"The steaks are really first class, thick, lean and juicy."
"We go to Salobrena regularly, and always go out of our way to eat here."
I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Carnivores - treat yourself - ENJOY!!
!
We had a great steak on the hot stone.
I don't recommend the mixed grill as you get too many meats including chicken so difficult to cook without worrying about cross contamination!
Steak was fantastic and great novelty of cooking your own meat!
Worth eating at whilst in the town.
We visited this restaurant because of the reviews on trip advisor.
I wouldn't bother again.
It was overpriced for what it was (we paid about £80 for two distinctly average courses each and just a glass of wine each).
"Most irritatingly, they sit the non-smokers (i.e."
most tourists) in the front room and then insist on having the windows and doors open onto the busy main road in Ronda which makes for some loud and unpleasant traffic noise throughout the evening.
The staff were pleasant enough until I asked for the door to be closed and then our waiter suddenly lost his smile.
"If I am honest, I couldn't wait to leave."
My worst meal whilst in Spain for the week.
We ate here twice also (El Bribon is the other one we ate in twice).
This is our favourite in the resort and I would strongly recommend taking a table inside.
"Outside, you could be eating in any al fresco, yes the food is great, but you won't enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant itself."
"To start, the decor."
"This place is crammed with cows... Ornaments, stuffed toys, advertising posters, postcards, photographs, figurines, cartoons, you name it."
Incredible.
The staff here are very friendly and inobtrusive.
The manageress is lovely.
"There are a large number of ""novelty"" dishes on the menu, like meats skewered and served on a hook or meats served on something that looks like a tagine but made of metal and the meat is on the outside (that reads terribly, sorry!)."
"They also serve fondue, but for me this place is all about the steaks!"
They know what they're doing here.
Both times I had fillets.
I like my steaks blue and each time they were done to perfection.
"My wife prefers medium rare, but on the second occasion thought it could have been a little more towards the medium, but she finished it nevertheless."
"Desserts are beautiful, the creme catalan in particular."
The bills were between €65 and €80.
Money well spent.
"I would strongly recommend this place and as I said, do try to get a table inside, if only to avoid the terrible violin playing busker who tortures the clients' ears at the tables outside."
we have been going to tenerife for 15 years and always go to the slow boat for a meal.
"it is nice and friendly, very clean, and the staff are very helpful ."
"its such a lovely place to go upstairs at porta colon and then after because your so full to go and have a walk on the sea front just down the stairs ( smashing food out of this word) love it love it love it :)  dont just take my word for it go and try ""the slow boat"" at porta colon play de las amerias"
We visit Port Andratx every month and nearly always call in to the Portabello either for lunch or an evening meal.
We have taken scores of guests there and have never had a bad meal.
It is often booked solid by locals unlike some other restaurants nearby.
I would say the price is mid-range for the port.
Wine is also reasonable and the location next to the sea is excellent.
"I would stringly advise nobody to try this restaurant, the food is poor even though we were told it was good."
"We couldn't eat the sole as it was overcooked and dry, we were told by the manager that there was something wrong with our taste buds, we chose incorrectly and that she tried the sole and there was nothing wrong with it."
"She argued and argued with us and eventually told us to""pay our bill and get out""."
We have never been treated so badly by anyone.
"Please don't try this restaurant, there are great restaurants on the port with lovely staff and great food; this is not one of them."
we have just come back from corralejo and went to el pescador and found it excellent we would recomend it janet and dave manchester
What can we say.
A friend recommended this restaurant to us and WOW its a true oasis.
"Excellent decor, location, menu, staff and value."
The rest you'll have to explore for yourself including the Bodeco Surprise for dessert.
Its in old town and just to the left and up the hill about 20 meters from the Irish Harbour bar (as you looking straight at the bar).
Be careful if your getting a taxi there as there is also a spanish restaurant (a good one too) call Bodego in old town and on one occasion the taxi left us off there.
Safest bet is to get dropped off at the Irish Harbour bar.
"Do yourself , wife , partner or whoever a favour and discover the delights of this place first hand."
Derek and Sue Ireland
Truly awful!
"Lots of rice sitting dried up for hours and hours we waited ages to get the seafood cooked, by the time it was done everybody else on our table had finished their meal."
"Overall it's mass canteen dining, wth bright lights and slow service ."
"Please go to the fabulous Thai restaurant on the coast road, much better value and far far superior service."
Personal interior with beautiful tiling and features.
"Very noisy traffic as well as the restaurant, late in the evening and early, early morning."
Not suitable for relaxation.
Centrally located.
Parking might be a problem.
Room 104 is bigger and prettier than 102.
Both on first floor.
Good food is served in the restaurant.
"Visit www.lobopark.com, very interesting."
Admission 8.- for 1½ guided tour.
Also recommend walking tours in El Torcal.
Both are easy to find.
Very good service.
Nice decor and atmosphere.
Food good but not special and over priced.
One for the tourist.
There are better places to eat
"Not bad food and interesting place but, due to its location its full with turists and overpriced."
"Anyway, service is good and you won't have problems with language."
The Hanaita restaurant in Palma gives great traditional Japanese food in good comfortable surrondings.
"Good food, nice building, great service, very expensive for what it was, expect to pay £100/$200 for a 3 course meal & wine for two."
Oh also full of tourists!
We went to book the hotel for a dinner on a Sunday night as we had been advised that it was wise to so.
"We booked a reservation that afternoon, despite some very non-plussed staff."
"When we arrived on Sunday evening we were given a table at the very back of the restaurant, miles away from other diners, and literally had the menus thrown on the table."
At that point we got up and walked out.
"The Bistrot has a very good looking ""menu del dia"" served at lunchtimes and a great location."
However our experience would suggest that the staff need to attend some personal skills training courses.
The Azur is a pizza restaurant beside the La Sort Restaurant in the centre of Moraira.
"Whilst it is ""Italian"" themed, it is Spanish run."
It is extremely popular and it is often difficult to get a table unless you book.
"Being a chap that falls short on such organisation as booking I fall back on not making bookings, but hope that they do recognise me Good value, large quantities."
We find it sufficient to share one starter and one pizza between us.
"They have a very good plate of mixed starters, I think 8 different meats or fish on tostadas for around 10€."
"The Pizza are the usual selection of fillings, but are well cooked and use decent ingredients."
"It does help to speak Spanish here, but if you don't, then don't worry, they will understand you!"
"I like the combination of food, service, surroundings and value for money here."
This restaurant is in a lovely setting in Puerto Deportivo marina in Benalmadena and by all appearances one would expect a high standard of food and service.
"However, in reality this was the worst restaurant food we experienced in the region, to the point that it was inedible."
Our disappointment was exacerbated by the failure of the Manager to acknowledge the vegetables were overcooked to a 'mush' and the (expensive) Turbot was unrecognisable.
"He failed to make any gesture of recompense..and is probably waiting for you, the next unsuspecting customer to dine there!"
"Had dinner at Solimar, enjoyed the food, atmosphere and location so much that we returned there the following night to celebrate the birthday of my significant other."
"Great selection of fresh seafood, beautifully presented, with open air seats on the beach."
We have eaten three times at this restaurant over the years.
It is on the pedestrianised section close to the port in Moraira (beside the Pescador Restaurant).
"The location is very agreeable, which is why we have returned in spite of the problems that we have had there."
"Oddly they do not have an interior to the restaurant, it is all outside, so eating there in the evening in winter is not possible."
It is only for sunny lunchtimes.
"The food is good, if in the past a little overpriced for what it was."
"Last year we had decided not to return after they tried to palm us off with the (expensive) A La Carte menu, and it took some perseverance to get them to produce the Menu del Dia."
A somewhat unnecessary and disagreeable start to one's lunch.
"Anyway this week, the sun had returned to Moraira, and we were wandering past the restaurant, and we noticed a very competitively priced menu del dia up on their blackboard."
14 euros for three courses.
"It is good value for money, even when you consider the small print - it actually say 14.95€ plus 7% IVA, which adds another 2€ on to the cost, but is written in such tiny letters as to be unnoticeable."
"I consumed excellent clams, sea bream and banoffi pie, while my wife ate pate, spaghetti with prawns and tiramasu ice cream."
All washed down with a bottle of house wine.
"When the bill came it was for 60€, somewhat more than I had been expecting."
Closer examination showed that we had been charged for 2 bottles of house wine.
It was in my opinion a fleece the tourist exercise.
"On pointing out to the waiter the error, there was not even an apology."
"It all adds up to an establishment perhaps being too opaque with charging, not offering menu del dia when you sit down, adding the extra couple of euros to the cost of menu del dia in the small print, and charging for 2 bottles of wine rather than 1."
This time we really will not be returning.
For me it is just not worth the aggravation.
We have just returned from Lloret and had our last night evening meal here.
Fantastic doesn't quite cover it!
A member of our party turned 18 whilst we are there.
We saw the manager a couple of days before who reserved us a table and even arranged a birthday cake baked and decorated just for us.
They made a big deal the birthday girl.
"The restaurant is immaculate, the food excellent and the service outstanding."
It's a family restaurant and you can tell so much effort is put into everything.
Highly recommended and good value for money.
This restaurant was recommended to us by the front desk staff at the Marriott La Sella resort in Denia.
Tasca Eulalia has ample outdoor seating as well as bar and indoor seating.
The tapas menu is very extensive and their wine list is pretty impressive.
"We enjoyed our first meal there so much, we went back again on our last night."
"They have every type of tapa you could want -- fish, shellfish, potatoes, sausage, chicken, egg, octopus, calamari, etc."
Every dish was well seasoned and brought out with perfect timing.
The service was great and our waiter was able to recommend several dishes we might not have tried otherwise.
"Situated on a very beautiful tree-lined boulevard that closes to traffic at night, there is a lot to do nearby in terms of shopping, strolling, and grabbing a gelato or ice cream after dinner."
After a long day of site seeing in Barceloa we decided to look for a restaurant close to our apartment so that we could get home quickly after dinner.
"From the front the restaurant looked small, cosy, well decorated and it with a only a few tables."
The menu looked fantastic and we asked or a seat.
From here on we were just blown away.
"Further into the narrow entrance, the restaurant widens considerably and has space for probably about 50 people."
The service was magnificent and most of the waiters could speak English very well which we were grateful for.
The food was out of this world.
I've travelled a lot and this rates in the top 10 meals I've eaten in my live.
Value for money it was definitely the best.
Even by South African standards (and our currency is not very strong) the meal was very affordable.
"We are going back there tonight, it is that good."
We went here early in the morning and had a great breakfast and first meal in San Sebastian.
"They offered a veritable buffet of tortillas (Spanish omelet’s) and small tapas (would have been great for a hangover, if I had one), and the service was extremely friendly and accommodating."
"It was raining the morning we were there so we spread out with books, playing cards, and laptops and were treated with patient hospitality and respect throughout the morning."
We’re starting to believe that the Basque offer the best service in the country.
"nearing the end of our holidays my partner and i wanted a special lunch,having left the children with granparents we decided on La Boheme."
"Great location ,nice moden interior with attractive table settings,we were seated in a prime spot with a lovely view of the arenal.We chose 3 tapas off the main menu ,although they do a special deal of 3 small tapas for i think around 5 euros.The service was prompt with the bread served attractively and still warm with the ubiquitous ""ali-oli""The portions were just right and the lamb dish was melt in the mouth and the clams fresh and tasty.After the meal we were served a small chilled bottle of dessert wine with 2 shot glasses which went down rather too well.....total price was around 30 euros which included wine and beer .... so not bad.Very enjoyable,felt like a special lunch which finished our holiday off in style"
"Although very crowded at times this tapas bar has it all...one of the best selections of tapas and montaditos(small bits of food on bread) i've seen in Spain.The atmosphere is frenetic but the service is great(if you can't get to the bar,waiters come out to you and help with your choice).The prices are very reasonable."
Visited on the 10th September 2008.
Excellent service nothing was too much trouble and the menu and cooking was inventive and very high quality.
Spanish with an international twist.
Not that expensive and excellent value.
"Modern decor, good wines, and a host that was obviously pleased to be looking after the diners."
"Undoubtedly knowlegeable and very proud of his establishment, right in the tourist centre of Cordoba."
"Very posh, very stylish, very classy but that's all."
Nice terraza outside but you can only order dirnks there.
they don't serve any tapas out of the premises.
Service incredibly unpleasant
Lovely all day food at a reasonable price.
Owners and staff very friendly.
Steak pie is to die for!!
You won't be disappointed
Been there several times at different times of the year and it's always been very very good.
A bit pricey but you get what you pay for....excellent food and excellent service.
"Great fish, (seafood is a speciality) and meat dishes (the duck is fab)."
Desserts are also super and it has a very relaxed atmosphere....an ideal place to watch the sun go down with a couple of glasses of vino!
The only problem is choosing what to have from the vast menu.
"Staff very friendly and genuine - it's a ""must visit"" if you like an unpretentious restaurant with great food."
I was really looking forward to tasting some Authentic Morocan cuisine!
However it turned out to be an expensive/tasteless nightmare!
"The guys upstairs were nice enough, yet when we got downstairs we couldn't smoke!"
This posed a problem as one of us is physically challenged and after having to leave the wheel chair upstairs it was impossible to for her to take a ciggarrette whilst waiting the incredibley long amount of time it took for the megre offerings to slapped onto our table.
"The menu was limited, the portions tiny, the food tasteless & the staff rude & unco-operative."
AND not a single Morocan in the kitchen or serving!
"This is a typical venue for the wanna-be's, Middle Class Oiks and would-be-hippies with more cash than taste-buds and think it's cool for the waitress to scoul and ignore you!"
"I'm no fan of ""Mcfastfood"" but wish I'd gone for a burger instead!"
To be fair the Ketchup was nice!
I feel cheated I DO-NOT RECOMEND THIS GLORIFIED SNACK BAR!
"We were trying to find a place for flamingo on Turia 62, but we were too early, so we turned around and found this little place with a nice garden restaurant."
The restaurant houses 10-12 tables and is all vegetarian.
The staff is friendly and there is a very nice atmosphere.
You can choose among several veggie dishes and i can recommend the gazpacho - very tasty and well balanced.
We fish with a lot of vegetables and eco.
red wine.
A good experience in a city with a huge amount of restaurants.
We paided 58 euro for 3 meals -coffee and wine
Nice location with outside sitting.
Food is tasty with a good varity to choose from.
Be careful with the beverages!
"We paid 113.- € for four persons, thererof 55.- € for the beverages alone ( beer , cola , Cava )."
Well this restaurant was a bit of a surprise.
Searched for it following reading a review in Lonely Planet guide but the description in the travel book didn't quite match the reality.
This is a michelin start restaurant with michelin star prices.
Actually you won't get to see prices until the bill is brought to you as dishes are written on a board and no prices are shown.
"The food was amazing though, truly scrumptious."
"The rose 'house wine' was also gorgeous, but then it ended up costing 17 euros... All in all a very good experience, but better suited for a special occasion than a quick and hearty lunch!"
What a fall from grace!
"This was once one of the most popular restaurants in old Sevilla, where councillors would receive their brown envelopes from their ""sponsors"" and the dishes were as good as the tapas in the bar still are."
But two of us dined in the upstairs room on a Saturday night.
"First warning, the short boring menu bore no relation to the excellent tapas in the packed bar downstairs and secondly too many tourists."
Not many Spaniards.
"The scrambled eggs with cod a la Portuguesa, to be shared, was barely enough for one, had no taste and was surrounded by straw chips from a packet ( 16.30 euros, a rip off), then my friend had cola de toro (two big bits, one small, 18.20 euros) which at least was not the usual veal tail and had an average sauce and soggy chips."
I had almost tasteless (again!)
"lamb meat balls which were supposed to have a minty taste, barely discernible (16.50 euros)."
Served with a spoonfull of more soggy chips.
A disgrace!
BUT the pudding of bitter orange was actually good and not stodgy but served with imitation whipped cream (7.50 euros).
"Two glasses of local Chardonnay wine was, well, a brave experiment, rather like Manzanilla might be if made in New Zealand."
No coffees.
No copas.
"Service, just decent."
"Price for basically four plates, two glasses of wine and a bottle of water was 80.36 euros."
This was a 10 euro menu del dia anywhere else!
"A complete rip off, obviously aimed in these hard times at tourists who have unfortunately seen previously deserved good write-ups for this place in their guide books."
Editors: keep in the tapas but forget about the sad restaurant!
I wonder where the corrupt councillors go now........
"Candlearia has a unique ambiance; quirky, laid back - yet obviously cleverly constructed."
"The whole dining experience is exceptional, from the welcome drinks (sparkling Rose) and olives, the appetizer; the home made warm rolls with olives or hint of pepper or cheese; to the great starters - we recomend the Duck liver pate with strawberries - to the well conceived mains, the Pork loin and the Ox dice were divine."
"The deserts were equally delicious, and washed down with lovely spanish wines - the Luis Canyas Rioja was deep, rich and delicious!"
Service was perfect - laid back yet attentive and well timed between courses.
We visited three times over our recent 3 week Spanish holiday and enjoyed each meal - the best we have eaten in Spain in 7 holidays!!
Equally adding to the experience is Peratallada itself which is a beautiful place to visit with history oozing out of the cobbled streets and every old building.
Myself and my family have just returned from a week in Marbella (Guadalmina to be exact).
This is a just few miles away from Estepona but we always travel down just to eat at the Rosatti when we are over.
"Firstly, the staff are wonderful and always make you feel really welcome even with small children."
They can all speak English which makes dinner so much easier.
"Secondly, the food is fantastic."
Perfect every time we have gone.
We try something different each time and so far I haven't got anything I didn't like.
"Thirdly, the view is beautiful."
Overlooking the marina with all the boats makes a perfect setting for dinner.
"Finally the restaurant itself is beautiful, mostly outdoors (covered) with plants and ivory covered tressels etc."
I really love this place and would recommend it to anyone.
Excellent!!!
!
"After an over-salted seafood ""arroz"" served by personality-less waiting staff at El Ventorillo Del Chato, I ended up at the A&E department of Cadiz University Hospital."
A small yet exeptionally sharp piece of clam shell which someone in the kitchen had neglected to remove had caused a trauma to my oesophegal tract.
"I was placed on antibiotics, strong painkillers and a fluids only diet for the rest of my holiday."
Not much fun!
"I admit that this ""accident"" could have happened anywhere but what really annoyed me the most was the rude, arrogant and dismissive manner with which the management of this place treated me when I brought the incident to their attention."
I was told in no uncertain terms that court action would be instigated against me if I dared to share my experience in any public forum!!
Incredible!
"We enjoyed this quiet, rather romantic little place."
"We ate on the main floor, and there are more tables upstairs."
The owner is multi-lingual and is able to easily help anyone in their own language.
Food and service was good.
It is around the corner from a main passage in the Albaysin so it is quiet.
Recommend it.
"We spent several days in Granada in May, and though we loved the city, we also found it a bit overwhelming."
"There were holidays, packed streets, and it was hot."
"The Albayzin maze is of course fascinating and you can lose yourself there for hours, but we were eager for a quiet place to rest our feet, cool off, and have a leisurely and wonderful meal."
We were lucky to find Restaurante Arrayanes .
"It's wonderful Andalusian/Morrocan (Halal) food, terrific service, esp."
"from the kind owner Mustafa, and an absolutely tranquil and peaceful oasis just when you need it."
I highly recommend it!
Please tell Mustafa that Emily and Norma from San Francisco say hello!
We've eaten here a few times.
"They do a good range of tapas as well as combined plates, etc."
and the prices are very reasonable.
I was there in March 2008.Unique atmosphere excellent sherry and very cheap prices.Tapas are very limited but they give you complimentary olives and peanuts.I spent a week in Madrid and went there 5 nights.This is the type of place Hemingway experienced.
Great atmosphere
"Very good food served by kind, friendly people."
Probably the best value in Nerja
We just went to Cadiz in August 2008.
We know some people who live there and they took us to this amazing restaurant called BALANDRO.
"If you've never been to Spain, you have to know that they serve either ""full meal portions"" or ""half portions"" which is what they call ""tapas""."
"Also, at Ballandro's if you seat at a ""proper"" table, the pricing from the food is more than twice than if you sit at the amazing long V-shapped bar or one of the ""bar tables"" behind it."
"You still get the great atmosphere and experience, just not a fancy table!"
"The price of each plate was between 4.50 to 8,50 Euros each, which is not bad for the quality, taste and amazing presentation!"
"The only thing is that you have to order from the bar and pick it up yourself, if you don't mind doing that, you will experience AMAZING food at great prices!"
"Please note that in Spain, they close the restaurants between 3 or 4pm til 7pm-8pm for the siesta!"
"If you come from another country where this is not a habit, be sure to be there before 9pm, as the place is very popular and there is line ups to sit at the bar or at the bar-tables around this time."
We spent 4 nights in Cadiz and we went back there twice!
We stayed in San Remo almost opposite this fantastic tapas bar but only discovered it hours before we had to leave... que lastima!
Tapas as they should be; your order is taken by the barman who takes your tapa from the counter-fridge to the cook.
There were tapas I did not see anywhere else in Valencia Province.
"Not the cheapest place in town, but the best we could find."
"Also; we think you can classify a tapas restaurant by its Calamares a la Romana: the lighter the batter, the better the restaurant."
Go and try yourself...
this place has the best and biggest steak ever just melts in the mouth well worth the money shall be back real soon .... jason
We ate from the limited but good menu of the day (3 courses for 16.50 euros) at El Madrono on two successive evenings while staying in Madrid.
The location is quite busy but not too much so and provided an opportunity for people watching.
"The food was fine, the lamb for the main course excellent, and the service gently efficient."
"One warning though, be careful if you are seated on a table on the outside of the restaurant area."
While we were there a handbag was stolen from another customer by a thief using an all too effective distraction trick.
We went here on our final night after a recommendation the previous evening.
Its run by Brits and has an Ex Pat feel.
All clients were british and if a spanish person ever set foot inside they would stand out like a sore thumb.
Nevertheless the food and atmosphere are first class.
However what makes this place unmissable is the price.
19.50 euros is still the price including 1 1/2 bottle of wine.
So for for two of you you get a 3 course meal for 39 euros including a bottle of reasonable wine.
Truely outstanding value for money.
Also ate at La Casa in the old town which I cannot find listed.
This is smaller and is run by a swiss couple.
If offers less choice but all food is home made and at 16.90 euros per head including wine this offers equally good value
I had read about this restaurant in travel books so I decided to give it a try.
"First of all, the restaurant is quite old fashioned in decor, but that was OK with me."
"Unfortunately, the table cloths were as old as the decor: the one on my table had lots of greasy spots and the table to my right had two VERY visible holes in it."
My wife had to ask the waiter for another napkin because hers was dirty.
"The waiter was not bad, he even tried to speak some English, but he literally stank!!"
"I know we were in sumer and it was hot, but it was horrible!!"
The food was nothing special and we had to wait ages for the main course to arrive.
Summing up: too expensive if you consider the quality of the food and the service.
"We have been returning to Calpe every year since 1998, and amazingly enough only found this restaurant this year."
"We loved the setting, the food was fabulous with a very good choice."
"The service was second to none, an absolute dream night out."
My husband and I were lucky enough to spend part of our vacation in Calpe visiting friends.
We spent 10 days and dined out every night.
"We enjoyed many of our finds, but I must say this was by far our favorite."
This chef is talented...his seasonings were perfect and his presentation was beautiful.
Dining is outdoors in a charming courtyard.
From appetizers to desserts (and we sampled quite a few) the food was outstanding.
If you're ever in Calpe you must save one night for Porto Blanco....you won't be sorry.
"i have been going to Mallorca for many years in particular to Puerto Alcudia , i discovered the Nova Marina in the year 2000 and whilst having tried other establishments always return there i cannot speak too highly of the resturant as it is always my No 1 place to eat the menu is vast catering for every taste the bar stocks copious amounts of beer and spirits the staff are friendly and very helpful,and i speak from experience that the chef is willing to cook and serve the meal to your requirements - never be afraid to ask The head waiter Pedro always extends a warm welcome as do the owner Jose and his wife Julie the resturant is on the Paseo Maritim looking over the harbour you can sit there and watch ships boats and people go by it has a great location there are gift shops and clothes shops adjacent to it ."
i will be going there in 2 weeks time for another totally chilled out holiday and no doubt gain a few pounds from the excellent meals wines etc which i will be enjoying
This was the first restaurant we went to on our trip to Spain and I just loved it.
"We purposely chose a place that was more ""simplistic"" and had a casual atmosphere due to jet-lag, while hoping for a good way to break into Spanish cuisine."
This place did not disappoint!
We ordered paella that has both shellfish and meat...it was just delectable!!!
"Of course, you do have to get used to shelling the fish and whatnot, so that was a bit of a challenge."
"Portions were pretty sizable, too."
"But, it was casual, very good food and nice service."
It felt like you were eating in the dining room of a relative who is completely removed from any sort of cosmopolitan lifestyle.
"I have to say that throughout our trip around Spain, we tried paella from each region and this one was by far the best."
A genuine family-run restaurant serving freshly cooked food in a simple way.
All Pizzas are freshly made to order and cooked in a proper Pizza oven -I have tried most of them and all are excellent - a thin crispy base with just the right amount of topping.
"But Toni's Pizza has much more to offer than Pizza - the menu is vast with Pasta (try the Canneloni), Seafood (try the Cod with prawns and baby garlic shoots), Steaks (try the Entrecot Mexican) various Chicken dishes (try the Chicken in Garlic ) and fabulous fresh salads (the house salad is a meal in itself!)"
"All dishes are reasonably priced and a ""Menu del Dia"" is also on offer for Euro 8.90 and includes a choice of starter, main course, dessert and a drink....for 8.90!"
"This has to be the best value in Santa Ponsa - it's very popular with locals but Toni's Pizza seems to be the best kept secret and certainly puts most of the other more'' high profile"" restaurants in the shade."
"If you are visiting Santa Ponsa, put Toni's Pizza on your ""must try it out"" list - you won't be disappointed."
"Directions: leaving the main beach on your left, go to the roundabout in the Irish Quarter (SunBeach roundabout) walk in the direction of Sean's Place, Toni's Pizza is on the left after 100 meters."
"Things started of well, the service was friendly and we were quickly shown to our table."
The problems started when the food arrived.
"The pizza's were terrible, one could hardly chew them as they were so tough and hard."
most of the finished plates returning to the kitchen were nearly half full of uneaten food.
but the worst thing was when i noticed the head chef blowing his nose and then returning to prepare food without washing his hands.
I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Ate here 5 nights of a 6 night stay on our boat in Torrevieja.
"Food was absolutely superb - so fresh & tasty, healthy and perfectly cooked every time."
Huge varied menu that would really have something for everyone veggie or not.
It was always very busy and many local here too - always a very good sign.
Staff friendly & helpful.
Can't wait to return.
Would highly recommend this place - it is the best place in Torrevieja to eat - no where even comes close!
!
"We regularly visit torrevieja, and always make sure to visit Restaurante Vegetariano as many times as possible during our trip!"
"Having tried almost everything on the menu, from wraps to sandwiches to pizzas to meals like lasagne, curry, or burgers (we're working on ticking everything off) I have to say i think this is the best restaurant ever!!"
Brilliant for vegetarians and so tasty it is sure to be enjoyed by meat eaters that dont have an aversion to vegetables!
!
"This Summer me and my family went to the restaurant bona taula in Calonge,the waitress took us to a table,we waited half an hour for them to take our order.The food is bad,the lovley view was pile of empty boxes,on the oder side was the toilets wide open.The waiter cleared the table with the cigarette in his hand,dessert we order a mont blanc,he open the fridge took what it was supposet to be a mont blanc,slapt it on a plate and broughtet to our table,it was only a jam tart with a little bit of cream on top.So this is one of the restaurant that are not going to see our faces no more.. WHAT A BAD MEMORY!!!!!!!!!"
!
Recommended to us by one of the British ex-pats living in Santa Eulalia it's not difficult to see why this restaurant is so popular (if a little difficult to find).
"If you're staying in Santa Eulalia wander over the river bridge to Siesta, turn right up to the top of a hill and take one of the turnings on the left back towards the sea."
There are three restaurants in this street and the first on the left is the Siesta Grill.
As the name suggests this restaurant specialises in bar-be-qued meats and fish.
It's excellent value for money and the food is really good.
It was the cheapest evening meal that we had during our stay in Ibiza and one of the very best.
I remember this place situated along the front.
"When asked for a table for 3, the manager with a smirk on his face advised us the restuarant was full, even though 85% of the tables were empty."
Must have decided they did not want our 18 month old toddler in their establishment.
Will not go near or try this place ever again.
Spent a really pleasant evening overlooking square.
"Food very good, staff very friendly and attentive."
Would visit again and recommend to friends.
First of all the location - a luxury hotel that is basically a generic international hotel block on a supposedly new and up and coming area of Barcelona at the Vila Olimpica - actually it is charmless ('Arts?'
who knows why they call it this.
How about 'Mall'?).
Go find your luxury hotel up in Gracia or the Eixample.
If you really need beach then go to Valencia or the Balearics.
"So international is this hotel that the allegedly 2* restaurant plays 1960's american pop - the Beach Boys, the Eagles... And, the tapas is terrible."
"Not 'new', just terrible."
Had we liked the sound of enough dishes (we did not!)
we would have been hard pressed to take the tasting menu since it required 6 cold dishes and 4 hot ones and several were not available...
The ironic version of cannelloni - here avocado wrapped prawn and ginger in a cold tomato slick was barely edible.
The 5 little squares of cod utterly bland.
The croquettes like any other Barcelona croquette but smaller.
My (tiny) lamb main course was good as was the tiny square of fluffy foie to start (good - not startling...).
The glass of red I had was quite passable - but should I say that in a michelin environment?!
Also there was only one red to be had by the glass from the book of wine otherwise offered (at 10Euro a pop).
My partner's Margarita was a lemony waste of space.
"We laughed our way through this, but really, never again!"
"- Oh yes, its really expensive too."
Great restaurant...lots of local seafood...great variety of salts...nice atmosphere....also try their sister restaurant a few blocks away...Cicerone...great Italian...
Under no circumstances should you consider spending your money in this restaurant.
the food is awful!
"Having ordered what was described to me as a ' delicious pork soup' , I was served up a huge bowl of lukewarm chickpeas with huge lumps of fat and unidentifiable 'bits and pieces' in it, it was disgusting!!!"
Having taken 2 very small sips of the broth .
I decided it was not for me.
"The only consolation was that it was shown on the menu for 2.90euros, or so I thought."
"When we received the bill, as I had chosen the soup as my main meal I had been charged for 4 portions, totalling 11.60euros!!!"
"They took the bowl away without asking me why I had not eaten it, they were in no way interested in why a customer had not wanted to eat their food."
"My husband had chosen Gambas Pil Pil, which he described as just ok.  Dont get me wrong, I would have been happy to spend my money on good food , but this could in no way shape or form be described as that."
"They were also in no hurry to give us the change from our bill and left my husband and I standing there for at least 10 minutes whilst they walked backward and forward past us ,having been asked for it twice."
"Give this restaurant a very wide berth, your hard earned holiday money will not be well spent here."
I am shocked that this restaurant is not listed on here!
I have also lived in Cala D'or before and i can tell you this is one of my favourite restaurants.
The food is superb.
"If you like meat especially, then this is the place for you."
"The Chateuxbriand (excuse my spelling) is to die for, as well as the fillet."
"And very well priced, especially compared to the restaurants in the marina, where i have paid double or more for these meats and they have not been as good."
Drinks are also very generous!
"Service is also great , friendly and the owner Rafa is very welcoming."
"I will be back to eat here, more than once during my next holiday in a couple of weeks."
"Quaint looking restaurant , close to the Marina."
"However, the food is just not up to scratch and they have really increased their prices since the last time I visited (about 2 years ago) There were 7 of us and although food not so awful you had to send it back, it was really poor quality."
My chicken salad starter (at 9 euros) had barely any chicken and was seemed to be frozen vegetable salad with a rose marie sauce poured over it.
The prawns in garlic starter had the tinniest frozen prawns.
"There are so many excellent restaurants in Moriara , it was a shame to waste money eating here."
To be honest my previous visit hadn't impressed but staff are friendly and we had two young children so wanted somewhere easy going and i remembered they sold a nice Rueda (Bornos white wine) .
The wine was the only thing I enjoyed!
I won't be returning.
I was in Gran Canaria in April 2008 and have just booked to go in October 08.
We stumbled upon this restaurant on the 5th day and as it was so nice we decided to go back there 2 days later on our last night.
The foods is amazing and the waiters are lovely.
Would recommend the Creme Brulee to anyone - best I've ever tasted!!
Will definately eat there a few times when I go back in 6 weeks.
we loved it - we've been back 4 times over aperiod of 18 months and have recommended it to others
I never recommend this restaurant to anybody.
The place is very bad sample of Spanish hospitality.
"Service is very bad, we waited for a bill half an hour."
The quality of food and vine is just awful.
Prices are very high and unreasonable.
"They provide children menu, but for 7 Euro you get just a dish with pasta, no meat, no vegetables, drink, and old ice cream."
Waiters are very unfriendly.Speak bed English.
"If you are on Costa del Sol-never go to eat to El Capricho restaurant, otherwise your evening will be spoiled."
This restaurant overlooks the harbour.
There is no indoor seating but the tables and chairs outside are covered by an awning.
They have a fantastic range of tapas.
Most people will know this as Club Nautico Restaurant.
It is located inside the Marina in a splendid spot(membership not necessary) .
The operator of the restaurant recently changed and its now so much improved.
"Run by the owners of Le Dauphin restaurant, the food is in a different class to what went before."
"Whats even better is the fabulous chill out bar above it called ""The Upperclub"" This open air lounge with comfortable sofas is just about my favourite spot in Moraira."
Great cocktails and wonderful views.
A little pricey .
"Put it on your ""must go"" list."
A great experience whether you sit up at the bar and eat and drink or sit down at the rear at the tabled area.
The place can be hectic and you have to usually wait your turn for a seat at the bar on on the tables but the drinks are reasonable and the food great.
It is also interesting watching the staff working like mad as they shout the orders for food at the two sides of the bar to the kitchens Ate there three times on a lunchtime and once on an evening and was never dissapointed
Must go to when in Barcelona!
The owner is super nice!
The food is amazing.
They are known for tapas.
The only thing is that you have to fight for a seat.
"It's located in their market, and it's really busy there."
"It's basically a bar and a few small tables around it, but it's always packed."
"You have to stand there and wait for a seat to open up, but it is definitely worth the wait."
They were in so many magazines around the world.
They were also on one of the food network shows.
we have been to restaurant indiagate several times and every time we were impressed by the service and the authentic flavour of indian food at INDIA GATE   if anybody will get any chance to visit india gate dont miss out because may be this would be your best indian meal in your life  the special offer on chicken curries buy one get one free is marvellous proper portions   i tried tikka massala and my husband had lam madras side dish bombay aloo .
we really enjoyed it   we have found proper or u can say the best curry house in benidorm so no more disappointments.
Wow!
This was the first tapas place we tried in Spain.
"On recommendation from our hotel, we walked here and were not disappointed."
It was quite overwhelming at first.
There is a patio but that closes at 12 AM (seems late but not in Barcelona time).
The bar area is packed.
"You must put your name down for a table and try to shout your order out for drinks/tapas to the ""captains"" hovering over the bar."
"If you don't speak Spanish or Catalan, this may prove to be difficult."
We ended up waiting for seats at the bar so we could point to items.
Ask for a menu but it might not help in identifying what is what behind the glass at the bar.
Order sangria for two.
"Point to what you want and order uno, dos or tres of each."
You are charged for each piece.
"We liked the salmon, seafood salad, olives and fresh cheese salad."
"Also, opted to just make our meal out of that instead of being seated - there are different items on the regular dinner menu."
11 PM seemed to be prime time here.
Definitely worth going to!
"The setting is fantastic, moonlight on your dinner table in an arab inspired castle."
"You need to be well off and in a party mood, or in love, to accept the final bill, though..."
"Again, using Tripadvisor reviews as a guide, we tried this restaurant."
"Quite a small menu, but excellent quality."
"We both enjoyed the full experience, but the highlight of the meal for me was the duck pate (foie gras) which I had as a main course - the closest thing to heaven I've ever eaten - anywhere!!"
"My other half had a starter of octopus with white beans, and he swears it was wonderful (although not my sort of food)."
"Not the cheapest meal we ever had, but we certainly thought that given the quality of the food and wine it was well worth it."
Great location and nice interior.
Wait staff was very helpfull.
Had a great appatizer and soup and was waiting for the main course but they fell short.
"I had the lamb, another the beef another the squid and all where just average."
After the great appatizers it was a let down..the house recomended wine was only fair too.
Its worth a try for the location.
It is almost 10 years since I last visited Cala San Vincente.
"I distinctly recalled a lovely terrace outside a small hotel, which served great food on a sunny day."
Would it still be there?
Yes it was.
"The hotel and terrace are little changed, albeit now with the new name of Niu!"
"If only the food was as good as I can remember, in view of the same unmistakeable lovely vista, and warm sunny day."
"Long gone are the excellent dishes of slow roasted red peppers, and fine ham."
"Now there are fish dishes that ""on paper"" resemble what you expect to find in this part of the island."
On the plate however the food verged on the inedible.
A first course of grilled large prawns were largely bland- only lifted by considerable application of lemon.
"The ""fish of the day"" was grilled John Dory."
"Unfortunately , its ""day"" was probably monday- and this was served to us on a thursday !"
Both my wife and I love John Dory when cooked expertly on the grill with good olive oil.
(see comments on Clivia in Pollenca).
"This ""old trout"" of a fish was comparable to a ""car accident"" on the plate."
It fell apart at the seams as we filleted it.
Perhaps like a tough steak someone in the kitchen had tried to beat some life into it before placing it onto the grill.
Floury in texture with an unusual taste perhaps (or hopefully) due to the oil used.
"It was accompanied by soft boiled potatos, and limp green beans."
Both were overcooked and underseasoned.
By the end of the meal they were also uneaten.
The wines were good- but you have to be truly incompetent to ruin the drinks as well.
Were we just unlucky?
"Judging by the dried rice sticking to the base of a nearby paella dish, probably not."
The mussel shells lurking next to the rice we could also see had not been properly cleaned.
104 euros for two including one and a half bottles of mid range wine.
The coffee was a dreary as the fish.
Did I complain?
No- this experience was best left to rest over time.
Just like the fish had been.
Contrary to the previous reviewer we have nothing hut good to say about this restaurant.
"We ate here twice in September, once for lunch and liked it so much we went back for dinner."
Beautiful setting and great food.
Very friendly staff.
Would definitely recommend it.
Great restaurant.
Good food very reasonably priced.
House wine very cheap and pretty good.
"Went there twice, tried the pork, veal, beef and rabbit, all were absolutely amazing, have never tasted such tender pieces of meat."
"As an 'apertizer' you'll be offered some bread, it comes with gorgeous garlic mayonnaise, very nice!"
We shared a started between 2 and it was more than enough - very generous portions!
"try the spanish tortilla, it's really really good!"
!
"It was a memorable experience, the view is stunning over the bay of Altea and the food is surprising!"
"Before going there i've heard several opinions, both positive and negative, expecially about the quality of the food."
"I have to say that the it has been a wonderful dinner, and what we ate was very good."
"We were in four, on a table on the terrasse."
"We shared two huge appetizers (Ensalada de la casa and a Tabla de pates y quesos), i had a Pierna de cordero while my friends had Merluza and Dorada barbacoa and Berenjenas parmesan."
"I tasted everything and i liked it, expecially the lamb and the fish which was really fresh and perfectly cooked."
Sharing a bottle of wine and water the average expense for person was 25 euros.
Definitely worth it!
Very nice authentic Indonesian cuisine.
"We had the rice table on my first visit, but my husband found that although lots of different tastes, nothing substantial enough to feel properly fed."
"Next time we tried the individual dishes and I personally feel these represent better value for money, as well as showing the chefs skills."
"The owners are genuine , warm Dutch/Indonesian family (2 generations) who deserve to suceed."
This was our first visit to Bajul.
They have been open for 9 months and are attracting full houses even on a Sunday night in the middle of September.
They are supplying value for money meals at affordable prices.
People are votong with their feet.
"A bottle of house wine starters and the rice table came to €60 for two, The starters were very good and the rice table is a selection of 15 little plates of Indonesian dishes and rice."
"They put two large turntables on the table and you help yourself from all or any of the individual dishes that take your fancy The food is not gourmet, but one would not expect gourmet at these prices."
But it is very well presented and very acceptable.
"What you do get is extremely good service, pleasant, efficient but at the same time friendly."
The chef proprietor comes round for a chat with everyone when he has finished cooking.
We will return there without hesitation.
We ate twice during our Mallorca stay at Sa Fonda.
The food and the service were great.
he value was very good for the money we paid.
"We mainly tried meat dishes (rump steak, young pork, pork fillet) and they were all great."
The restaurant is located in the centre of Manacor and you can park your car easily.
"I have lived here in Mijas Costa for 17 years, and last night was the first time I have eaten in Val Paraiso…….Why ?"
"Because I heard it was very over rated…….well after last nights experience I finally say from personal experience that, yes, it is, Very Overrated………The food was decidedly, well, crappy !"
"When one of the owners saw I hadn’t eaten my starter (prawn pil pil) he asked why, so I told him I just didn’t think it was very good, so he brought another which was marginally better……my main course was just as bad…….and the attitude of some of the waiters was just plain arrogant."
"To their credit, because I complained (very nicely mind you) we got 4 free bottles of wine !!!"
There were only 6 of us !!!!!
So a lot of dancing was done !!!!
"The entertainment was very good, though……..but the food is seriously not !"
I’ve had better in snack bars down here !
This is a bar quite close to Plaza Espana and the Rocafort Metro stop.
"The service is really appalling and we stopped there after a long day in town and at about 9,30pm on Friday September 19th."
"We ordered two drinks, two bocadillas and patatas bravas."
"The order arrived as two drinks, a tortilla, a plata combinada and patatas bravas, already wrong and more expensive."
"The bill, however, was even worse; two drinks, two platas combinadas, tortilla and patatas bravas a total of €41 (c£34) for what was meant to be a snack at the end of the day!"
The bill was challenged in faltering Spanish and corrected but it had the potential for completely ruining a special holiday.
We felt that we had been seen as easy marks for a quick tourist rip off.
Spread this word and DO NOT GO THERE.
"My husband and i stayed in the Hawaii apts in Terenova, The appartments were lovely but we passed ""the Blue Bar "" everynight and decided to have a chicken curry there 22nd sept."
"I had eaten a few mouthfulls of mine before my husband started his, the rice was piping hot so i didnt realise the curry was cold and some of the chicken frozen."
"We called the waiter and told him and his reply was "" i did not stick my finger in your curry to check it was hot"" we decided we were not going to eat there and the manager came to say sorry but he said "" these things happen now and again"" we were furious that it was a common experience."
the following morning i becam very ill and by evening i could not get out of bed.
I had both ends of me going on wednesday my husband called the doctor who gave me 2 injections and a long list of medicines to get at the chemist.
Our holiday was ruined i spent almost 4 days in bed all because a stupid chef forgot to cook the bloody curry before serving it.
Please do not eat in this restaurant if you want to enjoy your holiday..Paula
Sea food is average and the portions are small.
We left still feeling hungry and wallet a lot lighter than expected.
Ambiance is just ok.
"Whilst the service was pleasant, the waiters tried hard to look after my boyfriend and I with limited English (not a problem, our Spanish is basic and we don't expect everyone abroad to speak our first language), the atmosphere was lovely and the food was nice (although we had better in Valencia during our stay), we got completely stiffed on the starter/entree."
"In the UK, when a waiter in a restaurant brings out a starter which you haven't asked for, you either thinks it's complimentary or you imagine it will cost a small amount."
We got given a plate of Iberian ham and some tomato bread without asking for it before our main course of paella; we ate the ham and bread without asking if it was free or how much it would cost.
Silly us.
"When we got the bill, they charged us 22 euros for the ham!!!"
"Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip."
What a shame for a nice place to rip off foreign visitors in this way.
I visited Patio Andaluz last week & I've never been so ill!
"I had the fried hake & it was the night before we flew home, I woke around 6am the next morning & I was so ill I didn't think they would allow me to fly home."
"So if you don't want to be violently vomiting on the day you fly home, avoid!"
Have been going to Al Fresco every trip to Sitges for the past 5 years after seeing glowing reviews.
Last year the food was average but the service impeccable and ambience good.
But this year (20 Sept) they combined poor service with appalling food so won't be going back.
Its a shame because the outdoor garden area is fab.
Need to buck their ideas up and try apologising when they know they're getting it wrong.
"I love Tripadvisor - this was another restaurant we tried after reading the reviews, and it did not disappoint in the slightest."
"Not somewhere you could eat every night, far too expensive, but the one night we ate there it was superb."
I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone I knew who was going to Sitges.
"Excellent paella, very freindly staff and service, staff were very professional and able to communicate in English."
"This restaurant was not touristy, 5 separate rooms - 4 tables per room very private personal feel to it."
"Excellent value for money expect to pay €50 pp for 3 courses including drinks, very worth while!"
"Despite high expectations, we were sorely dissappointed by this restaurant."
The staff (with the one exception of a British holiday worker) bordered on dismissive.
"The food was, at best, mediocre."
"Passionate about good food, which doesn't of course have to be expensive, we were less than impressed."
"For example the starter of a seven herb salad which, put bluntly, didn't have a single herb instead a series of pretty basic lettuce leaves."
"The other supposed to be a potato and black truffle dish, certainly didn't contain black truffles but instead the, unfortunately widely used, poor relation which lacks any of the flavour and may as well not be there."
"I actually suggested we left after the starter - however my husband, willing to think the best, persuaded me to see if the main was any better."
It wasn't.
Nor was the wine - despite having been highly recommended by the Maitre d'.
"Quite simply I couldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you have lots of money, no sense and no tastebuds."
Just another japanese restaurant run by chinese people with the usual food.
Good quality/price ratio.
"We where 7 days in Fuengirola, and there are a lot of restaurants."
But one of the best is Meson El Candil.
A Spanish restaurant.
Very good prices and the service is very friendly.
( Fresh vegetables!
and home made french fries ) The restaurant is near the harbour of Fuengirola to the opposite of HOTEL FLORIDA SPA.
"I just suggest to avoid to have a meal in this place:  even if the decorum is interesting, the dishes are untasty, cold, coming from the freezer."
The wine (I took a merlot) is very ordinaire.
"And the ""cuenta"" is heavy."
"Just pass away, or have a drink there best wishes"
"Nice place, wide spaces."
Good meals and very low prices.
This is a great place to eat if you love meat.
"However, it is also a good place if you want to fill yourself with cheap meat tapas."
"I have eaten there with friends, and we have literally stuffed ourselves with tapas (Chistorras, Carrillada, Morcilla, Solomillo...) and beers and spent about 6 Euros a head."
"However you have to sit at the actual bar to do so, as they won't serve tapas all the way to the tables."
I recommend it to all my friends that come into town.
One of the best meals I have ever had in my life.
"For 2 of us, with champagne to start and a good bottle of wine it worked out at about £100 per head, so not cheap, but worth every penny for a special occasion."
"The service is very attentive, well co-ordinated and absolutely faultless."
The food is delicious and well presented.
The wine list is extensive and does have some cheaper options as well.
"There were lots of nice touches, like amuse bouches and nice chocolates with our coffee at the end."
I cannot praise this place enough.
Superb.
Quiet and nice place in a very good location near Plaza de Colon.
Menu of the day plus a la carte at a very good prices.
Very cosy!
!
Guided to this wonderful establishment by the waft of garlic on the night air just on the windmill roundabout in Benalmadena.
"Went on our first night, my girls had pizza, I had ginger chicken."
"This was a truly wonderful experience, I have eaten curries in Birmingham, Bradford, South Shields and the divine Sachins in Newcastle upon Tyne but I have never had curry as good as this."
"We returned four times in a seven day holiday and the lamb madras, lamb sag and lanb madras again were simply the best."
The service was great and the prices reasonable.
If you find yourself in Bedalmadena and you are a curry fan this is a must
Muy bueno excelente ademas sus altos caros son como una etapa dura de montaña en el ciclismo: seleccionan mucho jeje...
The food was tasty as my first experience for Tapas.
"However, the waiter was pushing a disgusting looking salad that looked to have been left out all day."
"Other than that, we had a variety of tapas and were overall happy with the meal."
It is a very gay-friendly atmosphere.
"Recently stayed in Fornells for a week, and due to Johnthedog's recommendations in a different thread, we ate at the C'an Olga restaurant one evening."
"Well, after the (mostly) tourist trap restaurants in Fornells, this place was a delight."
"Although not easy to find, after asking several people we finally found it tucked in an archway, near a bridge, out of the centre of town."
"We were warmly welcomed into a garden restaurant set on two levels, one in the patio area and one on the terrace which overlooks a lawned area with a modern water feature in the centre."
We sat in the patio and were given an iced Tio Pepe each with two tiny pastry shells filled with a delicious crab mousse.
Hot bread rolls and butter were on offer also.
"For starters, my husband had the cold garlic soup with grapes and I had the (four king) scallops with a Modena vinegar glaze."
The mains were a rack of lamb for him (eight small ones) and a leg of roast suckling pig with apple puree for me.
"All the food was of the highest quality, the highlight for me being the pork."
"Crispy skin, tender and delicious meat underneath."
"Also, both the mains were accompanied with dauphinoise potatoes and fresh vegetables, rather than the obligatory chips and salad dished out everywhere else we ate."
We had a very nice bottle or two of red.
"The only disappointment was that they couldn't produce the same one as the first, and the second was pleasant but not as good."
"Although we would have loved to have had a sweet, we just didn't have room."
"Then, to our surprise, we were offered a choice of brandy, peach or apple schnapps on the house!"
"After a very generous brandy for him and an apple schnapps for her, we tottered into the taxi, and happily went home fit to bust."
"If you are visiting Menorca and can get to Es Mercadal, save the pennies up, and go to C'an Olga, it's a treat worth saving up for."
"On a recent trip to Barcelona my friend and I sussed out all the best places to eat and were very excited about the restaurant called ""Moo""."
We did think that with the reviews and the title that there might be meat/ quality burger connotations and were looking forward to something to really write home about.
We were sorely disappointed!
The restaurant failed to rise to the expectations and fell well below what one would expect in a top city top restaurant.
"Granted the place was a really cool place, nonetheless, the menu was sparse and when we asked for side orders of vegetables we were told ""that is not part of our concept."""
The food was good - whatever small bit of it arrived - the portions were not just small .... they were non existant.
Service from the Maitre d' was also non-existant following my friend commenting on the starter - I think he decided he could not defend things and stayed away!
They did keep pushing bread on us..... goes to show realised how poor the portions were.
We ended up our night in that worldwide establishment of McDonalds - where at least got proper portions!
"This restaurant disappointed when one compares the top restaurants in Dublin, London, New York and other parts of the world."
NEVER before have I left a restaurant and headed to McD's!!
!
My girlfriend and I ate at Moo last week.
We did this in response to all the great reviews in several guidebooks.
"The waiters were aloof, the food was decent, but not exceptional and the prices were high."
We paid about $220 for dinner (only one of us drinks).
My soup lobster seawater soup was the only great thing I had to eat.
the rest of the meal could be had at dozens of other restaurants at a fraction of the cost.
My girlfriend's salad was full of sand!
They apologized but didn't take it off the menu!
Don't waste your time.
Absolutely the best Indian in Madrid in very friendly and cosy environment.
You can always meet Indian people dinning there.
Isn't it a good sign??
"I love their home made kulfi which, amazingly, I cannot find in London!"
!
"First up, let me say, I had very high hopes for this place."
"Goat and rabbit on the menu, decent meat and fish on display and a pleasant hostess to show you to your table."
Be warned my friends... All that glitters isn't gold.
The waiters are very poorly presented and one who passed our table regularly was in dire need of a shower.
"Starters: I had onion soup, so so."
My wife had prawns.
The portion size was generous and to be fair the prawns were as fresh as you could hope for.
Mains: I had been looking forward to the goat all day.
"It was delicious, but the portion was a bit small."
"My wife had sole which was drowned in butter and while it was tasty enough, she just couldn't finish it."
Dessert: I had chocolate mousse.
Not good at all.
The texture was all wrong and it didn't have the fluffyness or lightness you'd expect.
My wife had the flambéed bananas.
This was a huge mistake.
"Service had been slow enough (we'd finished our starters 20 minutes before they took the plates away, for example) but the guy doing the flambee was very disorganised and ended up having to bin a pan of molten sugar because it had burnt."
From the time of ordering it was 30 minutes before the dessert was served.
We had already had plenty of time to digest our food waiting for the table to be cleared after the main course.
By the time we'd finished our desserts we were both so tired and so unhappy I decided to just go to the counter to pay the bill but was ordered abruptly to go back to my table.
We waited another 20 minutes for the bill and for the only time on our fortnight holiday felt compelled to leave no tip.
Avoid at all costs.
"If you'd like a good traditional tapas, excellent service and waiters with a sense of humour, all for a reasonable price, I would recommend the restaurant ""Sailor"" on the boulevard Passeig de Colom, (not too far from the Estacio de Franca, at the very south end of the Barri Gotic, a few blocks from Carrer d'Avinyo/Carrer de Simo Oller) right on your way to Barceloneta."
"There is a patio out in front where you can watch the night life pass by, close, but not too close."
"The menu is extensive, as is the wine list."
"The selections are all traditional Catalan fare, with the really good tapas being an especially good value."
The food is excellent.
"The service is attentive, but not intrusive, and if your waiter likes you, maybe he'll treat you to some Apple brandy at the end of the meal, but don't let the Maitre d' know about it!"
"The waiters speak many languages, but they especially appreciate Patrons who try to speak Catalan."
"Ask for ""Perlo"" (in Spanish - Pedro), he'll treat you right."
"Sailor is located on the Paseo de Colon (in Catalan) aka Passeig de Colom (in Spanish), between Carrer de la Plata and Carrer de Marquet"
This is one of my favourite restaurants.
It overlooks l'Alguer beach.
"They have an excellent menu del dia for about 15euros consisting of bread & dips, salad, mussels, paella, desert, wine and water."
Also have a very good a la carte menu.
The fish here is excellent.
excelllent empanadas!
This Tapas-Bar is awesome!
"You have little plates with different colours, every colour means a different price."
You can choose between cold Tapas and warm Tapas.
It's a very lifely place and there are lots of people.
Shortly: It was awesome!
:)
It's ok if you all like rice but mind that there's nothing else you can have.
They have a wide range of different cokked rice dishes and they are good.
The place is really nice and comfortable and ver profesional service.
"Fantastic pizza in here, son said it was his best ever."
Gets very busy.
"Service OK, not the friendliest."
We have recently returned from a two week holiday in Estepona and were delighted to find The Elemi vegetarian restaurant just down the road from our apartment.
We ate there quite a few times and had something different each time.
The food is delicious and the service was great.
So if any vegetarians or indeed anybody that likes very tasty food please give it a try.
We can thoroughly recommend it.
"Beautiful food, portions are really big.....starters are amazing.... Great service......Definitley worth a visit or 2 ;-)"
We recently vistited La Luna Nell'Orto in San Miguel in Ibiza for a fantastic meal.
"The whole evening was a pleasure, you enter into the garden through a picket white gate, Dont be fooled that it is set just off a road, its not a busy road and the surroundings in the resturant are stunning."
"It is all outdoor and sooo romantic, verything about this resturant was excellent, the service, the food, Everything!!"
"We would recommend that while your in Ibiza pay this resturant a visit, you wont be disappointed."
"Having just returned from a 10 day stay in Soller we were lucky enough to dine twice at Neil's fabulous restaurant, recomended by our hotel L'Avenida,and by other guests staying there.I can honestly say that it was one of the best meals we had, the Crab risotto was one of the best risotto's (I am a big risotto fan)."
"The thai cod was also divine, (had it twice), if you are staying in Soller then you must takt the short 10 min and eur 10 taxi ride up to this lovely village and sample this lovely restaurant!"
We will go back!!!
Ali & Chris Manchester.
From the 17th September 2008 to 27th September 2008.
My wife an I had four great meals in the El Puente Restaurant Narga.
"The staff were very welcoming and attentive ie, they would remember what drinks we ordered and after our second visit the waiter Antoni remembered our names."
The steaks were big and cooked to perfection.
I will be going back for the same again on my next visit.
We were recommended to go to this restaurant by the hotel receptionist.
It was also on a lot of websites.
Looking at the other reviews we must have been unlucky.
We weren't outside but in the actual restaurant.
The service was very indifferent but we went along with it and the starters were fine.
My husband was then given chicken which was hardly cooked and indeed raw by the bone and I had Pork which was nothing special.
When we pointed out to the waiters about the raw chicken they just shrugged.
To cap it all they then gave us the wrong bill about 50 euros more than we should have been paying.
All in all a most unsatisfactory and not to be repeated experience.!!!
!
"Abac is the finest restaurant in Barcelona and, in my opinion, one of the best in the world."
The maître d' is perhaps the most charming one will ever encounter and the sommelier extremely knowledgeable.
Xavier Pellicer’s menu always delights and it is hard to look beyond the tasting menu on a first visit.
"The cheese selection is the finest I have seen and must be viewed, if only to have an intricate explanation of each cheese given to you."
"Service is impeccable, as is the food."
Abac is the only restaurant I have visited that has left me without even the slightest cause for complaint – it is as near perfect as I believe possible.
"Well, not enough can be said about this amazing restaurant."
It is located in a great neighborhood about 15 minutes by taxi from the center of the city.
From the moment you arrive you know that it will be great.
The service and food are equally impressive.
"The chef, Xavier Pellicer is a truly gifted chef, and his recipes are simple and perfectly prepared using only the freshest ingreidents."
The presentation was fantastic.
"The table service was like a symphony playing out in front of you, and even the placing and removal of plates and utensils seemed to sychronized."
"After this amazing meal, we were escorted to the lounge on the ground floor, a beautiful area that we would have been happy to travel to just for drinks."
"In the lounge we were served coffee and drinks, and then at the end of the evening received our bill."
"We had a chance to meet and spend time with Xavier, and also had a private tour of the boutique hotel that houses ABaC."
The hotel is beautiful and we look forward to staying there on our next trip to Barcelona.
"If you want an amazing and unforgettable dining experience, please do not miss this gem!"
this was terrible seven of us went there 9 sep 08 it is on main strip in correlejo prices through the roof we thought treat ourselfs on last night dont bother truley that bad go to fifth avenue great steak well worth the money
"Granted, this is a cafe, however very little of the food is prepared fresh, at least for the evening meal."
"There is no oven or stove, only microwave."
"The food was good and in fact, of all the restaurants we've tried in Barcelona, it at least had some spice and flavour."
It would appear hygiene of the staff is a problem though.
"Lots of hands in places where the hands should be washed after but are not - handling money, then food; fingers in the mouth then preparing food; waiters touching other waiters faces, then handling plates & glasses, etc."
Not authentic tapas but very good.
"Fair pricing, considering the location."
Barcelona is so touristy so finding this little place was like a bonus.
The wait staff and bar service is very friendly and accomodating.
We enjoyed the food and wine very much.
Broad selection of very tasty tapas.
Excellent jamon iberico.
Without reservation you may have to wait before getting seated.
Reasonable prices compared to the good quality.
"This area of Extremadura is famous for its pork ""iberico"" products, and the in-land Spanish are known for their love of meat."
"Since the pork legs are made into delicious hams, the rest of the animal has to be consumed somewhere!"
"El 60 is a country inn, with only meat on its menu."
The upstairs dining room is set with large tables for 10 -14 people.
"You can have beef (the t-bone ""chuleton"" is HUGE, for European standards anyway) or a thin steak (that was for the kids!"
"), lamb cutlets (excellent), pork cutlet, and the famous ""secreto"" which is the meat inside the pork ribs (hello cholesterol!)."
"All meat is served with homemade fries, so you should order a salad to go with it if you fancy vegetables of some sort... Not for vegetarians."
I have to say this is the BEST Pizza I have EVER Eaten!!!
"Ate here numerous times during a 2 week stay, and have eaten there at every visit since!"
Great & quaint atmosphere.
Excellent location!
Friendly owners.
Can't be beaten!
I would recommend this place to EVERYONE visiting Madrid.
"Good price, but with Pizza this great, I would pay almost anything for it!!!"
!
"Great food, service and atmosphere!"
We were recommended La Taberna del Gourmet for a special evening with family; good food and service in a relaxed atmosphere.
The recommendation was sound!
La Taberna is a wine bar and deli as well as a restaurant so at the entrance one is greeted by the sight of delicious looking food and an array of wines.
"We were led to our table by welcoming staff, brought the menus and helped to chose the food and wine."
"We selected a range of tapas, all of which were delicious."
Of special note was the bread with tomato and the spinach with raisins and pinenuts.
Unusually for Spain the desserts were excellent as was the interesting choice of sweet wines.
It wasn't a cheap evening but was definitely value for money and a first class experience.
"Very good food and service, even had complimentory shots after dinner, while a queue of people were waiting for a clear table- Super!"
"This is a truly great location just of Plaza Catalyuna but that is reflected in overpriced drinks, over zealous staff trying to move you on and disgusting toilet facilities."
Drink further off the Plaza if you can.
My husband and I spent the day in Siguenza and had lunch at Calle Mayor.
We had reserved an order of cabrito in advance and were glad that we did.
It was delicious.
"I had the lamb meatballs, which I would highly recommend."
We were very impressed with the attentive staff and nice atmoshpere.
It was very reasonably priced as well.
food was very good.
"prices very reasonable, and happy smiling faces."
well worth a visit or three.
The restaurant is in the nice old town of Begur and specialized on fish.
"Well if this is what you like, this is your place."
"Food is as fresh as it can be, we started up with Salad from Strawberries and well as a Salad with Goat Cheese / Nuts which was just great."
"We tried a White Wine from their on Vineyard, which was a Rostei Savignon Blanc, very young and dry but full of ""fruits"", fit very good to what came as the main dish."
"My wife had a huge plate of Langustinos and Gambas, I had a Tuna-Filet."
"Well, to get completely spoiled at the end you have to take desert."
"Strawberries, this time in Chocolate, Moroccean Tea and biscuits."
"Service was great so that was an exciting evening, great food in a very nice environment."
We often visit this restaurant and have never been disappointed.
The Food is a mixture of local spanish wth a far east twist.
It is always superbly presented and fresh ingredients almost always used.
The owner Jaume is very friendly and will recommend some superb local wines from his wine list.
The decor both inside and out is an archictectural dream with fabulous art and romantic chandeliers everywhere.
We go there for a treat or take friends when visiting and would really recommend it to any local people or those on holiday for a special night out.
If you are a real foodie and looking for a place to sample high quality majorcan cuisine this is it!!!!!
We found this restaurant on our first day.
"It is on the side of the marina away from the busier restaurants, and is mainly where a lot of the yachtees and boat owners seemed to go (always a good sign we have found)."
"We had the most amazing paella on the first day and went back several times and enjoyed Gold Bream, Majorcan style - which was delicious, the most amazing clams in majorcan style sauce (which we managed to get the recipe for) we had ever tasted and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his fillet steak in roquefort sauce aswell."
"The waiters were just lovely - made a point of being friendly but were not in your face, and the selection of wine was good value and a wide variety."
We would definitely recommend this restaurant - head and shoulders above most others in Cala D'Or town and in the marina.
"For the quality of food, the service and the price - all top notch - you do need to book up to get a table at 8-9pm ish as it is always popular but not overcrowded."
10/10
"Nice itntimate atmosphere, with good and friendly service."
"Brilliant food, with impressive presentation."
The steak with foie gras was a highlight - cooked to perfection!
Very good value for money.
"8 person with 3 courses, water, wine and coffee/drinks came at just above Euro 50 p.p"
"We were in Barcelona for 4 nights, and ate at Taller Tapas(really great), Sinatra(don't bother), Port Olympic seafood (don't bother), and Pla."
"By far, Pla was the best of all of our meals in Barcelona."
"The restaurant atmosphere is lovely, service is great, and the food a big notch above the rest of the restaurants we tried."
A wonderful hole in the wall restaurant that will not disappoint.
A lovely setting food pleasant.
my only complaint was that the prices are boldly written but in small print at the bottom of the menu it states plus 15% tax and service charge which made the meal more expensive than anticipated.
Worst restaurant i ever have visited.
"We were the first couple that evening and the waiters showed us a nice table and were very friendly, but after that there was no service."
We orderer soup two different kind and it was tasteless and cold.
We let the soup go back and a few minutes later the soup came again after a few rounds in the microwave owen.
Bvadr!
The fish was small and tasteless as well.
The bread was a simle baguette - no good.
We did not have the coffee or desert- paid and went off.
Very lousy.
Later we learned the this street is filled with simple and cheap restaurants - but this was too bad.
Stay away.
"Friendly staff, fast service."
"Fantastic menu, delicious food."
Reasonably priced.
Recommended!
"Went to Bens D'Avall at the end of August 2008, on the evening of our first day in Soller."
The restaurant is quite some way off the beaten track; but that's what makes it special.
It has a large terrace half way up the cliffs overlooking a simple bay with the odd house dotted about and with a square on view of the setting sun.
We got there and were greeted and seated at a table for 2 at the front centre of the terrace with a fantastic view of the sun starting to dip in the horizon (about 8:30pm).
"The tableware, glasses and service are what you would expect from a seriously good London restaurant and the warm breeze, views and noise of the cicadas just adds that extra element to it all."
We were served a small aperatif and went for the 7 course tasting menu.
I'm not a great fish lover so the lovely madame who is the Maitre'd found substitutes for a couple of the courses - one being foie gras and which worked well with the whole tasting menu.
She had gone off to consult the chef to ensure it all worked out.
"The food is clearly spanish in it's flavours, although herbs  and spices from further afield in the med have been used."
"The presentation is very modern - plenty of layers, foams and delicate touches to each plate."
"Combinations of flavours were excellent throughout, although one course was over salted."
The roast lamb and herbs was by far the best I have ever tasted.
"My companions dishes went for a lot of praise and despite only having earl grey tea for afters, came away feeling full and smiling."
"A full wine list, including some heavy french burgandies as well as some interesting spanish locally sourced wines."
We went for a Cava which we had as the aperatif and carried on with an excellent bottle.
"Service, food and ambience were amazing and it is a very romantic place for dinner - a great place for a proposal !!"
It was pricey by local Spanish standards but worth it.
"Good food (had fajitas), nice cocktails (margarita - what else!)."
Great atmosphere and background music is very chic.
Went with a couple of friends and we all thought it was superb.
This place was amazing.
Great small tapas plates and delicious drinks.
"There is a great restaurant in the back with a more refined menu which is really romantic, but sitting in the front where the bar is located is the real deal."
The staff are all super friendly and helpful.
"While in the city for just under 2 weeks, my wife and I went here three times for drinks and a bite to eat."
"Passadis del Pep is an amazing experience, although it can prove a little hard to locate for first time visitors – ask your driver for directions once you are out of the car."
It isn’t fine dining but the food is traditional and of a very high standard.
There is no menu and course after course of fantastic sea food is delivered without question or explanation.
The cava flows equally freely and the supply is seemingly bottomless.
Service is informal and friendly.
The entire bizarre experience was much like eating at the home of an incredibly hospitable family.
A trip to Barcelona is not complete without coming here.
A bit pricey but very good meat and profesional service.
Book in advance!!
Good resturant to spot some celebrities as you can deduce after the photos displayed.
One of the Real Madrid favourites.
"As a long time resident of German speaking countries, whilst working for a few months in Madrid, a colleague and I, of similar status, decided to try a bit of ""home"" cooking."
"Our first surprise was that none of the waiting staff spoke English, let alone German."
"The food, whilst typical of a German meal for quantity, was lacking in quality."
"Whilst there were many Spanish guests at our time of leaving, I think in these days, it is more of a novelty value for Spanish people."
"Unless it can recapture its former heyday, it is not a place I would recomment to Austrians, Swiss or Germans."
"From literature I read, it appears to have been absorbed into a chain of Spanish restaurants, and had lost it's Austrian/German authenticity and uniqueness."
"I would suggest getting some German speaking Spaniards, or vice-versa as waiting staff, perhaps a German cook, and certainly some appropriate music for atmosphere."
2/5 is being generous.
"Great food, an excellent restaurant."
They obviously use the finest ingredients and cook them well.
"Huge portions to satisfy largest appetite, all at a reasonable price and with excellent service."
"We discovered this place, and did not eat anywhere else for the rest of the holiday."
"Restaurant is always full, and its sometimes difficult to get a table, especially at weekends, but the wait is well worth it."
A must try.
"Champañería Gala is a lovely restaurant inside, with an amazing inner patio area crowned by what is probably the most beautiful chandelier in Madrid."
The positive aspects end there.
It's really too bad that the incredibly rude and unpleasant owner lady doesn't sell the restaurant to someone else who gives a hoot about their customers.
"The staff is incredibly unfriendly and very, very, very slow."
The prices have tripled (as in the rest of Madrid) in recent years.
And the food is mediocre at best.
The paella is very salty and requires liters of drinking water during and after.
"This place used to be a deal when they had the set menu which came with dessert, wine, the fun pantumaca, etc."
But all that is history now.
"Because the place is so pretty, the right size, and in the area we wanted, we considered celebrating our wedding reception here, but when we talked to the woman who owns the restaurant, she treated us so rudely and with such disdain that we didn't even call her back."
"Her attitude was like, ""look honey, I serve crappy food and the place is still packed every night, so don't bother me with your stupid wedding""."
Just for her 'chulería' the place deserves one star.
Yet another example of how in Spain restaurant owners very often don't have the slightest concept of how to treat customers.
"Quite a shock if you come from other places like the USor Asia, where they fall over themselves to try to treat you well."
Don't expect anything like that from this place.
"In the Spanish fashion, they will treat you as if serving you was a huge favor they are doing for you."
We have just returned from a 7 night stay in Caleta de Fuste and we went to Fado Rock every night!
Best food in town and would return to the resort for the resturant on its own!
Steaks are american portions and quality and there is such a big choice on the menu you want to try it all!!
Staff very friendly too.
Its a must!
"well tony romas has always been a favoutie haunt of mine when visiting benidorm, although it has been many years since i last went."
"On entrance into the restaurant the waitress appeared to have acold and was sneezing and blowing her nose whilst seating us, not very welcoming, although not her fault."
When we ordered the waitress changes and the new waitress was very abrupt.
"When the food arrived it was ok, typically TGI friday stuff, ribs and chips and coleslaw, it was ok. Then arrived the bill 96.10 euros for 4 adults, a RIP off!!!!!!!"
"and that was for basic staters,a shared main for 4, and 2 puddings, with only 1 drink each."
"I couldn't beleive it, then i gave the waitress the cash (no tip) and headed outside to get air, and she ran outside saying the money wasn't right, i had given her 10cents in another currency, 10 cents, that's 7p, and she embarrassed me for that."
"The food was ok, but definetly let down by lazy and arrogant staff."
"Not too sure about the reviews i've read I can be extremely fussy about the places I stay, the places I eat etc."
"I went with a group of friends, and really enjoyed our meals."
"The place seemed clean, the staff were attentive but not overly so, and the portions were huge."
Wasn't quite sure what i had ordered when my onion ring block appeared but it was very nice all the same.. Would go back for the ribs again for sure!
"The food was awful, my partner had steak and chips and it looked like a piece of sandwich meat, the waiters were unhelpful and we ordered a sirloin steak however received fillet and was charged for the fillet when it was their slip up."
Drinks were quite pricey and our bill was a bit of a shock.
"I had spaghetti in tomato but it just looked like a microwave meal, very bland and tasteless."
"When complained to member of staff he continued to argue with us, until we had to make a scene about the bill being wrong."
"As said before, a tourist trap!"
Had meal in this restaurant recently on trip to Benalmadena.
Found it by chance as its its on a street left at the windmill roundabout.
Its an attractive looking place and this is probably what drew us to it.
It was packed when we arrived and all tables were booked out with the exception of one which we took.
"The food was very good, ordinary but tasty."
"The staff, in particular a Scottish lady, were very nice and friendly."
The only downside was the overwhelming heat as the section we dined it did not have overhead fans and we almost melted!
Its so much nicer to be able to dine outside when the temperature is high.
"However, I cannot fault this place."
We choose a 2-course meal for E16.95 which also included a bottle of wine.
If I were back in this area I would most definitely visit this restaurant again.
I read the earlier reviews about this restaurant and was thoroughly looking forward to a meal with friends.
"Sadly we found a restaurant that is trading off its reputation, as opposed to delivering any kind of quality dining service, let alone one that justifies the hype."
Where to begin?
"I am not sure that any restaurant, even a Spanish one, should keep you waiting for 2 hours in the (very beautiful) courtyard waiting area."
"We ordered a couple of rounds of drinks whilst we were waiting, which took an age to come, which might explain why half of everyone's drinks seemed to have evaporated - unless there is another reason everything was half full?"
"In fairness, the waiters did top up the glasses when we complained."
Having got to the restaurant at 9 (we were warned that if we were late we would lose the table) it then seemed odd that we weren't shown to the table until 11PM.
"Odder still was the additional 30 minutes it then took until the starters were brought out, but perhaps the biggest mystery for me was why 2 small prawns wrapped in a bit of smoked salmon could take 2 1/2 hours to prepare and cost Euro 24."
"Perhaps it was the comedy over-sized lemon sitting on the plate, hoping to give the impression that there was some delicious food hiding behind it, but although I searched long and hard, there was not anything else on my plate that justified either the cost or the wait."
"I ended up eating some of my boyfriend's rather bland mushroom risotto, I think he was quietly relieved that he did not have to eat it all himself."
"We were hoping that this might be a blip, although I should have realised what was coming next when one of our group announced that they had been to the restaurant a few days earlier and had had to send the food back 3 times."
"To be honest, some people really don't take a hint do they?"
"My main, along with 2 other people in the group, was cod with chilli dressing."
"Except that, cunningly, there was clearly no chilli used at all in the preparation of the food."
"A waiter came around and asked us if we were happy with our food, and one of our group tried to explain that the cod was to be truthful, not great tasting and did not contain any chilli."
"In addition to the cod, two of our party had ordered steaks which were to be cooked either as medium or medium rare."
Both steaks were overdone.
"Unbelievably the waiter just shrugged and shuffled off, which was the final straw for most of us and we called over the maitre d' to explain our concerns and to question the point in waiters asking if everything was ok with the food given that when told that it wasn't they argued the point and then simply walked off."
"By now, nearly everyone in a group of 9 had had something seriously wrong with either their food or drink."
"The maitre d' apologised for the rude waiter, apologised for the delay and apologised for the poor food quality, and then offered us new meals."
"Partly because none of us wanted to die of old age whilst it was being cooked, and partly because we had no desire to see what else they could get wrong, we politely declined this tremendous offer."
"To his credit, we were then given some complimentary wine which might be the restaurant's marketing technique, get the customer so drunk they think they have had a good meal."
"We took a look around the gardens, which were small and as bland as the cooking , the photos on the website are extremely deceptive (for some reason we didn't fancy a desert either) and caught cabs back to Puerto Banus where a meal costing a quarter of the price would have been ten times better."
The cost averaged out at 80 Euros a head.
"Service was not included, quite literally."
"I took the attached photo of the toilets which about sums up this 'premier restaurant', crap upon crap upon crap."
Avoid!
The restaurant held such promise.
It was spacious and comfortable.
But the food was just plain bad.
Prawns that were massively overcooked may have been grilled originally but something else had happened to them before they reached our table!
When this was mentioned to staff it was dismissed with irritation.
The melon cubes were almost solid ice.
"Maybe we picked the wrong night, or dishes, or were just unlucky."
But there are another 82 restaurants in Roses..........
"Located on the Avenida de la Paz in the centre of Moraira, that is the big wide avenue, with trees and fountains down the middle, that runs down to the Castillo."
"Pulcinella is more of a restaurant than a pizza house, though it is in fact both."
"So if you want a bit more than a pizza, or just want to settle for a pizza then this is the place to go."
We usually have the pizza here.
"Possibly the pizzas at Azur are better, but the ambiance at Pulcinella is more relaxed."
Though both will lead to a bill of much the same proportion.
"It tends to be less crowded than Azur, and more Spanish come here."
"You notice it in the evenings, when the foreigners are all leaving by 9pm, and the Spanish are starting to arrive at that hour."
"I find little to choose between Pulcinella and Azur, its really a question of the mood I am in that day, as to which I would choose."
"And given the vagaries of closing in Spain, it is nice to have the choice, in case one is closed."
Tha nice thing about this place is that you seat on (how to say that??)
"""elevated structures"" with pillows, materass and you basically eat while lying down on them... Food however can be better (and more...) great also as a cocktail bar"
I've been to Kiosko Pirata on three occassions (with a big group as part of an organised boat tour) and every time they've overcharged for drinks by adding items to the bill that were not ordered.
"When arguing about the bill, they plead ignorance and use their apparent lack of English as a smokescreen."
On top of that the food is utterly terrible (unless you like very salty paella).
I will never go there again and I would recommend that you avoid it at all costs!
I have just returned from a beautifully sunny Port de Pollenca this afternoon back to a rain strewn Britain.
Apart from the glorious weather of the past few days memories linger of the excellent restaurant of La Llonja.
La Llonja serves some of the best fish dishes in the east of Mallorca.
"Attention to detail is clearly important, from the table layout to the well dressed and attentive staff."
"The dishes are seasonal- with wonderful ""fish of the day"" specialities."
"Now is the Mackerel season, and yesterday I enjoyed this fish in an excellent mediteranean sauce."
"Earlier in the week I found the Dorade in a ""marseillaise"" sauce unbelievably good!"
"The ""menu of the day"" is great value at less than 30 euros ( with wine, water, & coffee)- with nothing less than the best ingredients used."
The freshness of all the produce shines through.
This restaurant is so good it deserves more than the 5 stars I can give it.
"Tiki Tano From booking of the five course menu, arranging fireworks to be let off the service was five star."
We had 98 VIPs sitting down.
"I should not have worried, the staffing ratio was high, the food spectacular hot and beautifully presented."
The evening was rounded off with fantastic fireworks.
"If you are in southern spain, please go and dine with wonderful views of the sea."
Scarlett Smitt and her team are exceptional.
The best on the costa del sol.
i have been to two hotels in the Orient area and always try and make sure I go to the Mandala at least once each stay.
"The service is discreet and the food is an excellent fusion of classic food (duck, beef stroganoff, salmon) but given oriental flavourings, which atre mild and non-intrusive."
The puddings are nicely varied but it is hard to resist the nut brownie.
Having stayed at the Hotel America for 4 nts just across the road from La Polpa we tried the restaurant on our first night of our stay and went on to eat another twice.
The menu is varied and a three course meal for 2 plus wine and water cost approx 55 euros which we believe bearing in mind the quality of the food and wine was very good value for money which showed in the fact that most of the clientel were spanish.
me and my boyfriend went to piz paz a few times during our holiday the food was great and very fast!!!
"The waiters were all very friendly but one waiter was especially nice, David!!!"
would diffently recommend!
!
We sampled the set 11.25 eur menu which was fantastic.
It is very popular with locals (only open from 13.30 to 15.00 for lunch and was completely full by 14.oo on a Thurs plus evenings most nights).
and we were the only tourists that day.
There was a 3 course set menu with many choices as well as the usual a la carte.
"We had for example a bowl of creamy vege soup and a plate of wonderful hors d'horeves which included houmus, puree carrot and beetroot with grated carrot and sprouted aduki beans."
With warm rustic bread this was welcome change from the usual lack of fresh veg or salad in the meals we experienced in Madrid.
"Main course was a delicious spinach cannelonni, vege burger or a plate of mixed dishes - ratatouille and couscous."
this was followed by a huge choice of sweets such as fresh melon or mango tart or yoghurt.
We did not have room for coffee after that!
"I noticed the chef had recently added 2 organic chicken recipes to the menu, so something for meat eaters too."
Wish we had found this place on our first day in Madrid in stead of our last!
very good meat and very nice place..
very nice restaurant and very good mallorquin dish
very good steack and very nice restaurant
"Huge glasses of sangria or beer, nice tapas in a busy location."
"Beautiful decorations, amazing tasting menu."
"If you haven t been Thailand a wonderful way to discover, if you have been, the perfect way to remember!"
Traditional food in one of the most famous restaurants in Logrono!
Nice choice!
Nice place to have delicious fish and meat!!
"Overcrowded, so make reservation!"
"One of the coolest places to eat, chill or get drunk on a sunny afternoon"
An absolutely normal.
You don't miss anything if you go to other restaurant.
Best Indian in Barcelona
do not really like the service
One of the best places where you cand find quality and price.
"Incrdible wine list, tasty and fresh fish, and some traditional Basque dishes."
"Tiny place, very romantic!"
Typical and simple food served quickly.
Not bad at all.
Great Great Great!!!
Go there to try things you would not find in a traditional sushi place.
Try the Japanese pizza!!
No reservations so when you get there you just put yourself on the waiting list and then have a drink in their bar just infront
"Pasta & Pizza in a normal place, but wonderfully located just in front of Reina Sofia Museum."
A place where you can have decent Italian food with a reasonable price.
"Was ok, but too pricey."
Good selection of different dishes..
"Absolutely loved the Red Maki and Om Maki (I think, with salmon roe)."
"Sashimi was melt in the mouth, and the asparagus wrapped in meat amazing."
"Definitely would return as for our party (5 people) with about 8 different dishes and one bottle of wine, price was about 25€ per person."
Not bad for a good sushi restaurant.
Quality was definitely there
pretty good italian restaurant
expensive American style food
Really cool.
Very fine tapas place.
Unexpensive.
Fantastic view on the beach.
"Excellent food, service and wine list."
Sides in main courses charged extra.
Overpriced.
"Big restaurant, but almost the whole weekend is quite difficult to find some place, specially in summer!"
"good ""bocatas"", reasonable price, and quite easy to park the car..."
Tapas.
"Nice tapas, in a modern bar, with good Rioja Red Wine."
"dinner at the bar is good, the menus at the dinning room a little bit too expensive (2 different menus, 45 and 60 euros each)"
our favorite home delivery chinese restaurant!
Love the tofu
is not that good since 2 years.
"full, there is any other place to meet?"
"Fancier than Repla, a bit uptight but still gorgeous food."
More expensive than repla too!
"Great, tasty food with good ambiance"
probably the best for grilled meat in caleta
i stayed at the albergue part and had the second or third best peregrino menü on the camino here :)
you must ask for the tomatoes salad
chocolate mmmh!!
!
good meat
the best place in the city.
excellents pizza and pasta
Delish!
Nice setting in a Gaudi house.
Excellent food.
We had a good experience in this hotel but our experience of  Sol y Sombra was something else.
We waited half an hour before someone even acknowledged we were there - they had to be prised away from whatever they were doing.
The staff were generally disinterested and seemed fed up and exasperated.
"When we finally managed to order, we were brought a bottle of white wine which was tepid!"
Chilled wine was not available!
We were not alone.
None of the tables were cleared and everyone just had to wait or go somewhere else.
Avoid this restaurant or hope that the Hyatt manage to sort out the management of the place.
This is such a well positioned hotel in the La Manga resort overlooking the magnificent golf course and we were unlucky that the outside terrace could not be used because of heavy rain.
"The service, setting and presentation were good."
We were perhaps too close to our fellow diners and could hear everything discussed at the adjacent tables.
The food was beautifully presented but lacked flavour.
The wine list was OK but not adventurous - probably what the Hyatt purchasers bought in bulk rather than having some of the more interesting wines from Spain.
It was very expensive for Spain so we had high expectations which were not met.
We ate at the restaurant in July 2008.
Superb cozy Argentinean pizzeria owned by warm people and run by lovely staff .
Pizzas are great and don’t miss on the Empanadas and the ‘Dulce de leche’ pancakes.
There should be one Trenque Launque in every city!
"The ‘sister’ Argentinean restaurant, few meters away, is as good and delivers some of the best beef in Madrid."
"¡Sonia, Os echamos de menos!"
"To me, there are times when the whole quarter of Gràcia does not seem to be more than a (not very) big house."
"Through such (not very) surreal imagery, my friends' neighbouring flats are merely big bedrooms, and one Gràcia's plaza -a league of their own in terms of flair and bonne vie- could be your dream of a sunbathed Spanish patio."
"Providing the understandable requirement of speaking Spanish or Catalan is fulfilled, Nou Candanchú is the average joe's sitting room, bar or terrace."
"All year round, it is the best value for money bar I could ever know, the place where I make new friends and host the old ones, the place where -a local Cheers- everybody knows my name."
An excellent small place that focuses on delivering what it does best: burgers!
An authentic gem in the hear of Madrid.
"Always busy, but worth the wait, put your name down on the waiting list."
And the prices are fantastic!
Overall:  A restaurant themed on tibet food and culture.
A noble theme.
Some years ago this was a very good for value restaurant with delicious food.
Nowadays the heyday of their successes is a pale shadow of its former self.
"Ideal for those enjoying an extreme diet, as the portions only surprise the amount you paid for them."
Maybe the filling is spiritual?
"Ambience: Originally good, candles and soft music."
After a time the drumming and moaning became more oppressive - later it gave way to the radio.
"Food and Quality:  Very basic, totally lacking in flavour and inspiration."
Served in very small portions and as separates.
These expensive and sting food portions could have been cooked on an equal bar as a work experience chef.
The rice is sticky and quite clearly not properly washed before preparation.
Meals are served to the table with the skill and expertise of a PG Tips angry chimp DVD out-take.
Service:  From the outset prompt.
"However, when asking the waitress for simple advice between selected dishes we were met with a rhetorical remark of exactly the description of the menu."
"Even when the restaurant had 3 small tables of clients, service after the food and drink order was taken was painfully slow."
It was slower still if you refused desserts and coffee.
We paid the bill and waited for change that never came.
"We had to ask for the change, then left promptly."
"Conclusion: For ethnic food with spirtual current issues, check out Abissina [ethopian]."
"Far better tasting varied food, ambience and service."
The main difference is for 13 euros plus one beer you can expect to be well fed and not leave looking for a pack of patatas at the metro.
"This explains why my suggested restaurant was full midweek and this restaurant, was not."
Rating 2/5
I went there with four friends today and I have to write a review to warn other people.
We had reservations for five people and they still managed to put us on a table with just four seats.
The worst bit was the service.
"They are slow, don't serve meals at the same time for all people of the people."
They even managed to serve my naan and vegetables much later than the meal they belonged too.
The food was also cold.
Taste was ok. To finish this we had to wait ages for the expensive bill and even longer for the change.
Don't go there.
Go somewhere nice.
Very surprising ...in a good sense.
I will later write a longer report on my 3 visits to meson David
Located just off the Orange Square this restaurant is not the usual tourist trap that the name might suggest.
The menu changes every 6 weeks or so and the fresh bread (a very moreish speciality) changes daily.
With an excellent host (and his wife waiting on) you are always made to feel most welcome.
Has an interesting and realistically priced wine list and the host will recommend very reasonably not just the expensive stuff.
A place that goes out of its way to please and the food's not half bad too!
"I first ate here in 1993 & its been the first restaurant that I visit on all subsequent holidays in Puerto Rico, the quality of food is always excellent & the service & staff are brilliant."
We rate it 10/10.
Es Cranc is simply brilliant.
The food is superb - the lobster caldereta is sublime and the mixed paella a showstopper.
"Honest food, expertly cooked, fantastic service, genuinely friendly, frequented by locals."
It's not the cheapest but it is the best.
Ask for the menu del dia for daily deals inclusive of wine and sweets.
Ask to see the lobster tanks out the back!
"The food is by far the best in Ibiza, a must if you're on the island at any time of year."
"Lovely little bar we found whilst visiting friends, we had goats cheese with some sort of fig cake."
It was gorgeous!
"The wine is lovely, great choice."
Could do with some decent wine glasses!
!
I think the first reviewer has the name the wrong way around.
I think its called Terra Vina.
"Anyway, completely agree with his thoughts."
"A real find and in fact the first ""actual"" wine bar in Moraira."
Lots of wines by the glass to choose from (6 of each type) with quality hams and cheeses to compliment.
"(there are no hot tapas so really only for snacks)  I like the Spanish feel to the place (even though its English owned) , the intimate atmosphere and the Spanish guitar music in the background."
"Its behind the Chinese restaurant on the seafront, at the base of an apartment block."
I hope they do well.
Sorting out exactly where it is first.
"It is near the Castillo in Moraira, just but back from the front, directly behind Restaurant Eleven."
This place is good.
Nice decor with a relaxed atmosphere.
"Hosts who put you at your ease, and an eclectic (to use a much over-used word, but in this correct) collection of wine by the bottle, 50cl jug or glass."
They offer in addition a well sourced selection of quality tapas.
"It cost us, for 2 people, 40€ for a selection of tapas, a 50cl jug of good wine, the tasting menu of desert wines and coffee."
And was incredibly good value for money.
They offer all sorts of other incentives to get your business.
"People were trying their wine tasting selection at the bar, 5€ a head, and getting a wine tutorial as part of it."
"The selection of 3 dessert wines that we had was well worth trying, and we have signed up for their ""Spanish lessons and wine tasting evening"" As another reviewer said, these people deserve to succeed."
They are putting their heart and soul into a good product.
I hope that we will be able to visit Terra Vina regularly in the future.
"Firstly , I agree with Mymoraira I think this place is called Terra Vina."
We're just back from Moraira and although we were staying literally around the corner from the bar we unfortunately didnt discover it until 2 days before we left.
"It is , however , well worth looking out for."
"It is , IMO , exactly what a wine bar should be."
"The wine list , like the bar itself , is small but perfectly formed , a mix of Spanish and new world."
We only had time to try 3/4 but each was terrific -- a Nobilo sauvignon blanc ; a Priorat and a beautiful Chilean Cab Sauv/Carmenere blend they were just about to add to the printed list but which was recommended by the staff .
The staff are friendly and obviously enthusiastic and energetic about the wines and the business but without the slightest trace of snobbery /pompousness you often get in wine bars.
"We didnt have a chance to try them but they had good ideas on the go -- an incredibly reasonably priced tasting deal (from 4pm till 8pm , I think) , spanish lessons with wine etc."
"Its only been open 10/11 weeks but I hope its a success -- it definitely deserves to be -- if you are at all interested in wine I dont think youll be disappointed -- if youre not this would be the perfect place to start -- you definitely wont be made to feel awkward about asking for guidance or advice and you can buy bottles to take away of whats on the ""by the glass "" wine list."
Pjjcm
Great typical cooking from Madrid.
"Ingredients are top quality, it is the classic fare you crave in Spanish cooking ."
"I love the old fashioned setting , the very friendly and professional service and the general appreciation of the place and food they serve."
I would definitely go there every week if it opened earlier.
"9.15 being the earliest they open at night, unless you eat like a sparrow, you will spend the sleepless night regretting it."
We didn't stay at the Queens but wished we had if the atmosphere was anything to go by.We popped in for a meal one evening and ended up having breakfast and meals there most days.Allwe can say is the staff were brilliant and the food superb and very good value.Thank you to Wayne and Derek for being such lovely people and also for including our grandson in everything.Would certainly consider staying in the hotel in the near future.Best Regards Mick Kim and not forgetting grandson Leaham.
We ate here on a Thursday night in Mid September.
It was quiet in the restaurant athough the tapas bar was full.
We had the gourmet menu.
"It was 50 E for 7 wonderful courses of innovative modern cusiine based on,local produce with some traditional dishes."
Each course was small and beautifully presented.
The menus are on the website.
The service was good and they matched some wines with the food although only limited wines were available by the glass (as we found in much of southern Spain).
If you want a real treat I highly recommend this.
Myself and five friends visited this restaurant purely based on the reviews on this site.
It took a little time to find as it is off the beaten track.
"Unfortunately, I also encountered Spanish hostility for the first time in 30 years of going to Spain when I asked in Spanish a Spanish couple if they knew the location of the restaurant, but that's another story."
"Anyway, we found the restaurant and sat at our reserved table."
"The service was slow, unfriendly and unhelpful."
We were not shown a wine list until we asked for one.
"The food was okay, far too salty and again the service was terrible."
"We had planned to order desserts and coffee but after being ignored for over ten minutes we didn't bother, nor did we leave a tip."
Can't recommend it to anyone.
Shame.
La bola used to be sinonymous of good cocido and better service.
"But thing has changed: service is rude, fast: they serve one person before others in the table, they interrupt the conversations....but the saddest thing is the cocido."
"The cocido of LA bola was a must: today is a shadow of what it was: oily, tastless...The rest of the menu doesn't worth."
"It´s a sad thing when a good place start to live only for the name.Definitily, there are better clasic restaurants in madrid: and more economic."
With a group of friends I went to Santa Ponsa for a long weekend and found this most delightful restaurant.
"The decor was fab, the food devine and the staff were excellent.We enjoyed it so much that we went there to eat 3 nights out of our 4!!!"
No8 Bar & Grill is definately on my list to visit again & again.
The place was well above the standard set about other places in santa ponsa.
"Clean, modern and simple food done well."
Unfortunately there wasn't anywhere else apart from this place that offered such a good lunch so we had to go back again and again.
Would definitely recommend
"The Decor, atmosphere,staff, service and food are superb, a restaurant definitely worth a visit whether staying in Santa Ponsa, or the surrounding area."
I'll be back there again and again when visiting the Island.
Caelum is an unexpected find in the heart of the Barri Gotic in Barcelona - you don't come across many tea rooms serving delightful patisseries.
Our first visit would have warranted an Excellent rating with superb service in spite of the fact that there was only one girl serving a permanently full establishment.
Our second visit failed to live up to the same level of service but we will put that down to the different waitress having an off day.
Would definitely recommend giving it a try.
"Found this place by accident, whilst wandering with two hungry children and hungry husband on tow."
Wow!
"Great views, great waiter service, great food, great hospitality!"
"And hospitable they were - whatever you think of the french ( that is bad thoughts ), all will be dispelled."
"The restauranteurs and waiter ( Their son ) sat to eat on the next table after service had finished for the afternoon , this was followed by a lengthy chat and some friend -making."
Ran by extremely hardworking french woman and her family (included of course-Pepe himself) .
There is a warm welcome to children and english visitors attempting Spanglish.
"Prices-reasonable , food-passionate, service-impeccable, hospitality - second to none."
"Well,well worth a visit!"
"Of the many restaurants we ate in this September at Puerto Andraitx, El Coche was the best all-round for choice, taste, efficient service and price."
"The menu was wide ranging enough to suit the four of us and we tried mussels, carpaccio, turbot, beef, stroganoff, chicken and desserts too."
Service was friendly and efficient and the restaurant manager obviously took great pride in seeing things run smoothly.
We were delighted to receive a complimentary orange sorbet palette cleanser at the end of the meal too.
Would happily recommend and return here.
We have visited this restaurant many times and have always had excellent service and food.
The management and staff are extremely pleasant and very helpful.
Highly recommended.
"After a mediocre experience at Casa Flores, my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice lunch at Los Portales and we weren't disappointed."
The service is what really distinguishes a meal at this classic El Puerto de Santa Maria eatery.
From start to finish everything is first class.
Whether it is menu recommendations or the impeccable service of the dishes and beverages everything was perfect.
The real reason to eat out is the food and in this department Los Portales does and exceptional job from the exceptional quality of the raw material to spot on preparation.
Los portales sticks to classic Spanish preparations methods based in the traditions of Cadiz.
"Nothing nouveau or fru-fru just very well prepared dishes: pescaito frito (fried fish), arroz (rice dishes with seafood) and lobster - a Los Portales specialty."
We enjoyed a plate of pescaito frito and a lobster grilled to perfection.
Everything was so good that I decided to celebrate with a whiskey ice cream cake for desert with a good shot of Scotch.
We highly recommend a leisurely lunch at Los Portales.
"The prices are about average for a meal of this caliber, which is to say that most people who are reading this can afford it as a occasional treat."
"The restaurant was full on a Saturday night, except that the friendly head waiter gave me the option to sit in the back room adjoining the kitchen which used to house their cooking school."
"For a single foodie diner, this was a perfect experience."
I chatted to the wait staff and the chef occasionally and admired the tautly efficient kitchen assembling my five course degustation menu.
"As for the food - it wasn't all cakes and puddings, but rather a challenging marrying of flavours which at times I thought was a bit over-ambitious."
"Flavours would sit together that weren't just unusual and unexpected, but almost on the extremes of the palate - very sweet and very salty in the same dish."
"Next time I visit Barcelona I will visit their school, as I want to learn how to scoop icecream into perfect egg-shaped dollops."
45 euros for degustation and water.
We have been visiting this restaurant in San Pedro for more years than I can remember now every time we are at our house nearby and enjoying good value seafood.
It's a regular with the locals and having sampled most of dishes on the menu I can see why.
For an unpretentious local restaurant it's hard to beat.
DAC.
North Yorkshire
"i love this bar, the staff.... the food is good, english food... the bar have everything, pool, internet its a family bar, Roger & Jenny, and their 2 kids daniella and aimee, and Clive & Irene and their son Andy... and some others staff members....  i just like too sit outside and enjoy a cold San Miguel Pint"
First of all I have to say that you can feel the love for hospitality in this family restaurant.
"Mum in the kitchen, son in the restaurant."
Both very enthusiastic.
"The menu, however, is a little out of date."
Portions are too big and dishes overpriced.
A starter at 18 Euros is pretty steep.
With a lot of updating this could be a lovely place.
Bullfighting restaurant facing the bullring.
Loads of character from pictures and bulls heads and capes around the walls.
"Super food, I had rabbit which was excellent"
It's hard to find a real good restaurant in Ronda.
Most are overpriced and overrated.
There are just a few places where they actually seem to care about what they serve you.
I've been to Pedro Romero and I can't believe it has a michelin recommandation.
"I mean, the food that was served was not bad but could be descibed as 'little above average'."
"If you really want something good, with friendly service and well balanced prices you can try the Bodega San Francisco or the Almocabar restaurant both located on the Plaza Ruedo Alameda."
Enjoy!
"I was in Madrid with only enough time to go to one flamenco show and was recommended the Cafe de Chinitas by the staff of Hotel de las Letras, where I was staying."
The show that was beyond myexpectations.
I would highly recommend the Cafe de Chinitas to anyone interested in authentic flamenco.
I do not usually write reviews but this bad experience has left me so annoyed that I have to write this.
A group of 12 of us went to The Brasil on the saturday night of my 40th birthday weekend.
It was truely terrible.
The menu was a sticky book of laminated pages with photo's of each item.
- Should have been a warning of things to come!!!
All 12 of us ordered a meal and waited and waited eventually the meals started arriving slowly.
However only 10 meals were served and those were not good.
"The Paella was soggy, the well done steaks were raw."
When I complained funnily enough no one could understand us or spoke english (although it wasn't a problem when we were ordering).
They tried to offer us 3 congealing meals that had been left on the side in the kitchen!!
"There was no apology or attempt to rectify the situation, just an attitute of 'tough not my problem'."
When we got the bill they tried to charge us for the meals that hadn't been received and the got quite menacing and abusive.
"It spoilt what should have been an excellent evening, half the party ended up having to call at a burger bar!!!!"
Not good.
I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
Discovered this little place in an alley just by the little church.
It is a busy place but the service was quick and friendly.
"Very good pizzas with a decent selection of other tourist dishes,especially the starters, and a full dessert and ice cream list."
"You could eat here for less than €10 but we paid €35 for bruseetta,,2 pizzas,2 desserts and wine."
Enjoyed it .
"Service is very arrogant, this is a typical tourist trap."
I would not recommend this place to anyone.
I ate at this restaurant one evening in October 2008.
"The Restuarante El Jardín has been open in Puerto Alcudia for many, many years."
"In the recent years it has undergone a major refurbishment and I would say, a complete change of direction and therefore, of its' clientele too."
"We ate upstairs, in the new part of the restuarant."
"It is all very swish, very nice."
"The lighting in the restaurant, the tableware, the decorations, etc are all very elegant, and in general, it is tastefully decorated."
"Their website will give you a good idea of what it looks like, as the photographs genuinely reflect the feeling in the restaurant."
"The service is professional, from when you are greeted at the door (we were greeted by the Chef herself), to the Maitre D' taking your coats, to the waiter who comes round serving different types of bread."
Things that I loved about the restaurant?.
"The lift (yes, I wasn't expecting to find a lift!"
"), the bathrooms (absolute perfection, even with complimentary girlie necessities!"
"), the bread, oil and different types of salt (the olive bread is a must), the wine list (you will understand when it is brought to your table), and the Chocolate 08 dessert (you must try it!)."
The Majorcan style hake with prawns was nice too...
The crockery is to die for.
Things I didn't like?
"Well, the price for one thing."
"""Coca de foie"" (foie gras on a cracker-type base, we are talking about two slices of foie about 5 cm long each, and it costs 20 Euros)."
"I understand that this restaurant is for special occasions, however my party felt that the prices were a little unreasonable."
They also didn't have a few of the main dishes.
"There were no dishes suitable for vegetarians, however I am sure that had we have asked, perhaps something could have been sorted out."
"And at times, they served a few too ""many plates and dishes"" ..."
"When we were served coffee (nice coffee cups by the way), the cup was served on two plates?!?."
"The menu is on their website, minus the prices."
Would I go again?.
Maybe.
If it was to celebrate something really special and if they changed the main menu.
funny experience that none coming to Barcelona should miss :)
"We are just back from a week long say in costa adeje and although we stayed half board, we wanted to try this retaurant as we had read some great reviews about it."
"The food was absolutely out of this world; big portions and delicious, we couldn't have faulted it in any way."
The service was also very good; something that is very hard to find these days!
"If your staying in this part of Tenerife, and you love chinese food, you must visit this resaurant, (you may want to book for a Friday or Saturday night as we were lucky to get a table!"
).
My husband and I had called in for a drink on a stroll around town and thought the place was very well represented and such a nice location on the beach that we said we would come back the following night for a meal.
What a mistake!!
"We arrived to find only a couple of tables taken and waited for the waiter to seat us, there were plenty of tables and we were pleased that it wasn't too busy, The waiter barely grunted at us and shoved a menu in my husbands hand, I helped myself to one and off the waiter marched."
"He pointed to our seat then promptly left us to view the menu, I was a little suprised at the waiters lack of enthusiasm but ignored it."
"We then waited over 10 minutes for someone to come back and take a drinks order, we caught plenty of waiters eye but they just looked away."
Finally someone came over so we each ordered a cocktail and a still water to go with our meal.
He said someone would come back and take the food order.
"After another 15 minutes we were presented with our water, no cocktails, he grunted something and stomped off."
Another waiter took our order at which point snatched the menus from us with no courtesy whatsoever.
I was feeling a little annoyed at this point as a paying customer but not wishing to spoil what had been a good day tried to forget it.
A basket of two bread rolls arrived which he practically dropped on the table.
The attitiude was really quite shocking and you felt like you had walked in on a major argument.
Our cocktails finally turned up just as I was about to ask where they were.
The starters were very nice when they arrived.
"I started to relax again, however I was looking around the room and I could see other people were having a bad time with the service in this place."
"One couple were waiting for the whole time we ate our main course for someone to come and either offer them drinks or the pudding menu, in the end they got up and paid at the bar and left."
"My main course was spinach lasagne and it wasn't great, just tasted like tomatoe soup and spinach mixed with sheet pasta, bland to say the least, my husband ate the chicken and said it tasted great."
We then also had the problem of no one coming to see if we wanted more drinks or puddings so because i was feeling quite fed up we got up and also paid at the bar.
The guy at the bar looked seriously annoyed at the fact that we had bothered him and was shouting something at another guy.
They then printed off the bill and he shoved it at my husband on a tray.
"Due to the force of his movement the bill floated off the tray and fell to the floor near the waiters feet, the waiter looked at it then turned away in disgust whilst hubby bent down to retrieve it."
At this point if I was fluent in Spanish they would have had a piece of my mind because I was furious!!
"We were not the only ones to experience this, when we spoke to other people on holiday they all said the same."
Such a lovely place but the service and attitude stinks!!
"I am not usually one to leave reviews but I am so annoyed the their treatment of people who are their bread and butter that I wanted to share my experience, there are lots of lovely restaurants in town all perfectly pleasant and eager to look after you, just avoid this one !!"
!
El Pescador is situated in the music square in the old town.
Its Steaks were the best Ive tasted.
The staff were very friendly with my family and tried there best to make your stay there pleasant.
There is also a musician in the square and couples and children get up and dance.
I ate there 4 times and would definately recommend.
I noticed the Bar Restaurant Avenida was not listed on Tripadvisor so thought I would give it a mention as I found it a nice relaxing place to eat and the service was very good.
There is a large outdoor seating area amongst palm trees with plenty of tables.
Inside there is also plenty of seating if the evenings are a bit chilly and also a nice games area for the children with air hockey etc.
to keep them amused.
There are also plenty of TV screens with music vidoes and the odd football match too.
"(mainly German and Spanish matches) The menu is the usual kind of food for a holiday resort such as grilled chicken breast with chips and salad, but also some pasta dishes and fish, but all the meals I had were tasty and plentiful."
The drinks are also good with plenty of choices of cocktails etc.
"Although there seemed to only be a handful of staff they were all very friendly, efficient and a couple of them spoke good English."
"In all, I would recommend the Avenida and the next time I go back to Costa Calma, will definately visit again."
"I have been going to Bar Cine for several years now.The sea food is always fresh and the chicken is excellent.I have noticed lately however that prices have increased so it is no longer as cheap as it once was (as well as the euro being stronger against the pound).As regards service,it is always efficient but rather perfunctory.Dont expect service with a smile or any great interaction with the staff,who have the attitude that they supply good food and perhaps do not need to do any more."
Simply a different level in regards to food and service.
Top end restaurant for the area did not come across anything that even touched this place
"Yes, this is mostly a tourist place,but it does have local charm."
"The food is really good, but not not stunning."
"Not alot of vegetarians, but meat heaven."
Service was very friendly if you know at least a bit of Spanish.
Walk-ins accepted if you have the patience to wait 20 minutes and then be taken through the warren-like kitchens and rooms.
Highly recommended - the best in Madrid?
Possibly.
And there are way older restaurants in Cairo!
Okay.
"I gave it a ABOVE average, but only because of the location."
And that is only if you can get a window view.
"Otherwise, the food was good, to really good."
"But very good, well, maybe not."
"This despite a ton of prizes, and a glossy booklet with numerous pages and photos showing ""look how good we are"" that is handed out with pride by the restaurant."
With no menu del dia on a weekday--it also is pricier than other choices.
But for a one-off--if you can sit at the window and see that aqueduct--do it.
"Hey, life is short."
"The food we had was all good, but not spectacular - the fish was the highlight."
The house white wine was also good value.
"We ate on the ground floor which was a little cramped, and the atmosphere was a little old fashioned, but friendly and helpful."
Provided you do not put your expectations too high based on its reputation and other reviews you should not be disappointed.
One of the first places we ate at in Nerja.
Great value local food with really friendly staff.
"As well as the odd tourist it seemed like there were lots of locals there, which is always a good sign."
baby back ribs were not baby back if you want the best ribs on the island then head for Tony Romma's they are real baby back ribs and the portions are American size.
The Steak was not that good either Marios up the road and turn right get a T bone what a difference.
Harleys is big and brash and the food is average if you want good food that tastes great then this is not the place.
We had not planned to eat here after the negative review but our target restaurant was closed so we ended up at Cafe Berlin and were pleasantly surprised.
"The set menu at €12 seemed good value with a choice of 6 starters,main and desserts but seeing some of the small servings coming out of the kitchen we went for the a la carte and were pleased we did."
"Lovely calamares,good steak and two good puddings plus a bottle of lovely house wine came to €38."
Another couple chose duck in blackberry sauce and a traditional fish dish - something we would like to try next time.
"Good efficient and friendly service Altogether a nice evening but in our opinion go for individual dishes,not the menu, and avoid the first three tables by the bar and entrance as it can get busy and noisy in that area."
Much better than average small restaurant (not a bar!)
"for tapas, medias raciones and raciones."
"Inventive food, very good service."
it's all right
The Tapas were OK.
"I ordered a Gazpacho andwas informed that that was warm weather soup, and offeed another called CALDO (hot)."
It was a tepid (bordering cold) tasteles broth.
"The Lateral Jamon Iberico was unexceptional, maybe even a bit funky--I expected slices of ham."
Turns out the shredded red cabbage that my neighbors were eating was the ham!
"The croquettes of Shrimp were a gooey gelatinous substance encased in fried food...overall, I'd move elsewhere for better food."
"PS, service was a tad weird."
They obviously didn't appreciate a single taking a table and twice tried to give me the check before my final order arrived
we eat in natalies while on holiday mallorca last week.
the old guy was very friendly and spoke to all the customers and a very funny gentleman.
"We told him about our experience at ""the Blue Bar"" where i got food poison , he could'nt do enough to help us ."
The food was excellent just like what your mother would cook.
"I would like everyone to try their Steak pie is gorgous, my husband loved it (home cooking) i had lamb cutlets and veg and their were 5 cutlets on the plate and the gravy was to die for."
Its worth the walk around the bay to this restaurant from terenova was fab food.
Thanks to the old guy for being so nice to me on our visit there.
pollydom
"Ate at Natalies quite a few times when we took our grandson to Palma Nova, Foeed was good and reasonably priced staff were very friendly and great with kids"
"While this is a nice 4 star hotel, there is no reason to go here for the food..."
"Lunch was ok, but dinner was very average..."
"If you're staying in the hotel remember to ask for the special hotel guest lunch meny, and go somewhere else for dinner."
There's a nice and small Italian restaurant just behind the hotel... don't remember the name..
But go left when you exit the Portixol.
"We go to Gran Canaria at least three times per year and the Padaban is with no doubt one of the best restaurants of Playa del Ingles, eighter for the quality of the food, the service and the price, for a tourist area."
"Completely renewed this summer, the ""new"" Padaban is THE restaurant where we prefer to go."
"Just for a beakfast or for a complete meal, this restaurant is fantastic !"
Tried this place in September following earlier reviews and we ate on the patio at the rear.
"Food and wine was fine,well priced and served but there were negatives The main course comes plain,without veg,unless ordered and the chips provided had been cooked in poor quality oil."
"Also the chairs are of the white plastic beach type and this, coupled with paper tablecloths, is a put off."
"Our bill was €40 for 2 main courses,desserts and wine although there was a fixed menu at €11"
"We actually stumbled into Ses Olivares as a result of getting caught up in a gale and pouring rain, and finding somewhere to shelter."
One thing led to another and we ended up with a full blown meal.
"A few tapas to start were very nice, but it was with the mains that the quality really shone through."
Fillet steak with Roquefort sauce was cooked to perfection.
I asked for it rare and it arrived that way.
The meat itself was of the highest quality.
Other mains we had were equally good.
Service was very efficient and friendly.
"House wine was a standard Rioja, well priced and very drinkable."
Desserts were very well presented.
Would definitely return and recommend it.
Lovely views over the bay in Soller
For me the absolut best Restaurant in Cadaques.
Delicous fresh Food.
I have eaten maybe the best Vindaloo Curry in my life.
Have been there four times.
"On weekends, it's very crowdy."
Take a little time.
this is a restaurant that I always go back to.
"The menu has dishes from all over the world (Japan, Thailand, Spain, Italy, Mediterranean....), all of them very tasty."
"The restaurant's philosophy is to share, so order several dishes and try as many as you can."
"Because you can't make reservations, it's always a good option if you want to improvise, but be ready to wait."
"Good food, nice atmosphere (a bit packed sometimes), non-smoking, open from Mon to Sun, fast service, and not too expensive."
Only drawbacks: the desserts.
I don't like them (I especially don't like the cheesecake and the tarta tatin).
"after five days of tripping in Barcelona, I've tried several places both for Lunch and Dinner."
"today, we've used tripAdvisor and without any searching, came to Cuines Santa Caterina."
"The food is amazing, the design is spectacular and the place has awesome vibe."
"quite crowded (in a good way), waited for a seat (for two) 10-15 mins while drinking at the entrance-bar and then got a seat at the main bar."
"GREAT PLACE, bar seats are warmly recommended."
checkout the daily specials on the electronic board.
Enjoy!
"We visited this bar for lunch one day during our visit and found the service to be friendly and half racions of dishes including fired fish, spinach with chickpeas, spanish tortilla and pork stew were hastily consumed."
Very reasonably priced and located in a pretty square beside the Hospital for the Venerable.
"Good food, well prepared, attentive service, moderate price for the very touristy area ... recommended."
Forget all about your previous tapas meals...
"I'm usually not a fan of tapas, but Forn has the most beatiful food!!!"
"We went back three times in one week... there are so many highlights on the meny you just have to try them, but definitively don't miss out on the Alex special dessert!!!!"
"Also read Xoans review for more details... P.s - I don't impress easily when it comes to restaurants, but this one I'll remember for a long time."
(and I can't say that about the Tristàn restaurant which is supposed to have a Michelin star)
This is one of the best restaurants in Puerto Rico.
Good choice of food and always well cooked.
Staff very friendly and make families welcome.
We've been visiting Puerto Rico for six years now and have been regular visitors to the Garoe Grill.
It has been consistently good and we have never been disappointed.
Would highly recommend.
Modern restaurant.
Poor quality food (our experience was of main course dishes with small amounts of meat and lots of fat) and very overpriced.
The staff were unhelpful and not friendly.
Seemed to be aimed more at attracting tourists than locals.
On a warm September evening we sat at an outside table with views over the Castle and beach.
Good choice of meat and fish dishes at sensible prices for a restaurant with such good views (€10-12) and a good menu le dia for a few €'s more.
Good sized helpings with lovely side vegetables and good house wine at €8.
Evening made magical as two large cruise ships lit up the bay of Tossa as they sailed passed.
Quite simply..one of our best meals ever.. Akelarre is simply in a class of its own.
"Im not sure why people have written saying that that the food had no flavour or the restaurant isn't memorable because ours was bursting with colour, flavour and imagination."
"The decor may be minimal, but would you want anything else?"
"Simple, smart and elegant."
It compliments the food brilliantly.
"From start to finish, the chef kept us on our toes and everything was a masterclass."
"We sampled one of the tasting menus, which together with hor d'hoeurves and other house treats, added up to 9 courses and the servings were of a decent size as well."
"For EUR 135pp, it was good value for money, especially coming from London where such a night would cost at least twice that much."
"To cap it off, the chef came out at the end of the night to talk to the patrons."
It was special.
5 stars out of 5.
We enjoyed a great menu del dia dinner at a very reasonable price for three courses.
Service and staff were just great very friendly.
"Looks like it is best to make a reservation, glad we did as it did not take long to fill up the place."
But we did enjoy the evening spent there.
Will go again for sure.
Varied menu at a relatively cheap price for a major city.
Starters and main courses delicious.
Dessert a bit of a let down though.
Good wine list.
"Get here early, you will queue after 20.30!"
Only complaint was that you do have a feeling of being rushed....dishes came out very quickly but didn't taste 'warmed up'......!
Good value for money.
"Gemisant is a little way out of central Moraira on the road towards Calpe (on the right), but not far (1KM or so) and it is a pleasant walk along the coast."
"I have been going there now for several years and it offers superb value, is spotlessly clean and the service excellent."
"Same staff in all the years I have been going there, including all the waiters."
"Juan, front of house and owner is a real gentleman.The quality of food is good and consistent and they cater for kids really well without having to offer a 'kids menu' of rubbish."
"Simple menu with local fish, meats, homemade pizza, pasta etc."
Something for everyone at very reasonable prices.
Their wine list is excellent and one of the most extensive in Moraira.
Go for the recommended house red or white 'vino de la casa recommendado'.
Superb and amazing value.
Gourmet Gemisant is not.
A top class (and Spanish) family restaurant it most certainly is.
"A word of warning - the a la carte starters are big, so share one between two."
The house plate of local cheese and pate is worth a try.
A relative who lives on the island first took us here about 8 years ago and it's now a must every time we visit.
"The food is excellent and authentically majorquin, the service is charming and the decor delightfully unfussy."
Try the fig ice-cream if they haven't run out....
4 years on the restaurant is under new management and with a different cuisine.
"However we were far from disappointed, the welcome was warm, the staff friendly and efficient, the atmosphere & dining areas calm."
"The 2 of us enjoyed food excellently cooked in paticular the fish, cooked to perfection [so many places overcook fish these days]."
"We have no hesitation in recommending the restaurant and will, when next in the area, revisit."
Peter & Tommy Sept 2008.
Be Warned - do not eat here unless you agree the price first.
"We were looking for somewhere to sit down and have an alternative to the fast food on offer and this sandwich shop / cafe looked like the perfect place, just off the main drag."
We ordered 2 paellas and 2 bottles of soft dink.
"The food was ok, the drink cold, (from the fridge)."
The price........I almost fell over 40 Euros.
No wonder the place had so much available seating.
The food should have cost 20 Euros maximum.
The prices were not published so we couldn't argue.
Please learn from our expensive mistake.
Avoid this place if you value your wallet.
We tried the tapas and they were very expensive.
"The quality is average, the wine horrible and the size under average in Spain."
"Do not ask for coffe or liquors, they charge double as compared with other places in Madrid downtown."
"What can I say, reccommended by fellow holiday makers, we manged to make a reservation for our last night in Calpe."
We had by far the best meal of all whilst in Spain .....and we managed quite a few meals!
"The food was delicious, first class, the setting romantic and the service was impeccable!"
"The owners were a delighful couple, fellow brits themselves."
They delivered an awesome meal which offered amazing value for money.
The Bar area a nice touch too for pre or post drinks.
A MUST if you in visiting Calpe or nearby towns!!!
Don't miss out.
I only hope we get back soon :-)
"It is just the best restaurant in salou, Nice people, nice meterianian food, nice serving, Just the best!!!!"
!
"Great food, great atmosphere, wonderful building - a traditional catalan experience."
"Was good in 2005, intend to book again for next Barcelona trip at New Year."
"Paella with squid ink was delicious, and creme catalana was delicious and huge."
If you are after fine dining and chic bistro - forget it.
This is rustic catalunyan cuisine at it's best.
7 of us had a meal at Los Caracoles.
The building is very quirky and intriguing but the food was decidedly average and not particularly cheap.
"Apparently the restaurant is ""famous"" for its chicken on a spit so most of us chose this and that is all we got, along with a pile of fairly unappetising chips."
The chicken was dry and needed gravy or a sauce.
The paella was nothing more than ok.
There was quite a good atmosphere and it was very busy but there are definitely better restaurants in Barcelona!
We have had a holiday home in tenerife for the last 25 years.
Pancho's used to be our favourite restaurant.
it is on the beach in a lovely setting and Paco the owner and his late brother the chef had a gem of a restaurant.
Over the last year it has declined miserably.
We went there on Saturday night Oct 4th 2008.
It was very quiet.
I ordered the grilled lamb chops.
which were one of the specials that night.
They were inedible.
they had not been grilled but roasted and then kept warm.
They were tough and although there were 7 of them I only ate 2.
Paco theowner came and asked me what the problem was.I told him.
His answer?
'Thats how we cook them' he did not take them off the bill or offer a replacement.
The bill came to 55 euros.
"for 3 starters and one main course , no wine and 1 coffee."
"He could not have cared less, ."
Since we used to be regular clients at least twice a week we were gob smacked.
"No wonder it is empty.We eat out 3-4 times a week regularly, Pancho's is now off our list!"
"Firstly don't be confused by the name, Steak an Rib makes it sound American style, its not, its Spanish."
We eat here every time we are over.
The food here is alway excellant if on the pricey side your looking at 100 euros for 2 people with wine.
Be aware when ordering main course if you want veg you have to pay extra
Originally we walked in and when we didn't have a reservation we were ignored.
However we managed to schedule one for later than night.
We we returned the staff was much kinder and from then on out the service was great.
"We were prepared for it, but the prices were a bit high."
"It's 12,55 euros per person for Paella, but it's worth it."
It was delicious.
We'd tried Paella in Barcelona and other places in Madrid and this was by far the best.
"We had the Valencia Paella, which was rabbit and chicken (I'm vegetarian so I just picked around them)."
"The traditional has mussels and shrimp, but beware, they are the whole entire shrimp, eyes, antenna and all."
"Overall, highly recommended."
"I was a bit hesitant to go here due to the ultra-trendy factor, but after some ""coersion"" from my husband, I relented."
"And, I was not disappointed."
We didn't have a reservation but were seated within 5 minutes (around 10PM).
"There is more than one floor for seating and the tables are close together, but the simplicity of the decor and overall vibe make up for the noisy atmosphere."
The food was really good!
I had a goat cheese salad and the grilled vegetables and the flavors were just superb.
"The portions were not too big, but larger than tapas size."
"The best part was that the price was very reasonable compared to other places we had ventured to during our trip (under $100, when the EUR was $1.45USD)."
I would recommend it if you are looking for good food with a bit of a contemporary vibe without the fluff.
This is a wonderful restaurant with amazing food.
It is in a lovely peaceful location yet within a few minutes walk of the town centre.
There is a beautiful outside terrace covered with grape vines for summer dining and in the winter there is a spacious dining room with a roaring log fire.
"The food is lovingly created by Consuelo and her 2 sons also lend a helping hand and husband Juan is front of house, the vegetables are also all organic and home grown."
"The experience starts with 3 starters (no choice, you get them all) and these are whatever are the freshest ingredients Conseulo has that day, believe me they all leave you wanting more as they are a tease for the delightful main course to come."
There is a large choice of main dishes together with a fresh fish choice depending on what has come from the Harbour.
The fillet steak is most definitely the best I have ever eaten in my life and always cooked to perfection.
This is dining at its best in Majorca and this restaurant is mostly undiscovered.
If you are anywhere near Cala Rajada give this place a try you will not be disappointed.
The prices are comparable to other restaurants in the town but the difference being the passion put into this place in terms of ingredients and surroundings.
"We ate at this restaurant with our daughter and her friend, both aged 16."
"It has a good atmosphere and was obviously popular - several people were turned away after we arrived, as all the tables were taken!"
The girls had Spaghetti Bolognese and both cleared their plates enthusiastically and my husband and I both had pizzas which were excellent and very tasty.
"The restaurant is tucked away in a corner, but opens onto one of the main streets of the Balcon - a nice area to wander around, looking at shops and mingling with people."
You absolutely have to try La Escalera in Benahavis.
"First, park along the roadway before you enter town."
Trying to park in town is difficult.
The food at La Escalera was fabulous.
You MUST try Grandma's Pork Loin.
"Marinated, garlic, tender, I had it twice."
"Salads good, deserts excellent, great garlic bread."
But....the staff who works there is hysterical.
"While you are eating, they do little tricks, a wonderful man sings and plays guitar, they try to give you a little entertainment, and it was wonderful."
Prices good but you will not regret eating here.
"GO, GO, GO!!"
!
Had dinner there on 10-16-08.
Took the waiter/owner's advice on two dishes.
"The first, a baby leg of lamb consisted of a huge leg of lamb with meat so tender it was falling off the bone."
Seasoned perfect and dressed with olive oil.
"The second dish was a pork fillet cooked ""like Grandma does""."
"The pork was marinated, butterflied, and cooked on a grill, giving it a slight smoked flavor."
Again the meat was so tender a knife was not needed.
"Each dish came with a baked potato that was also fried, crisping the outside."
"I also reccomend the baked pear, served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream."
"Add to the food the great atmosphere, authentic Spanish signing and guitar done by the staff themselves."
"This is a small, family run restaurant that is operated the right way, taking care of the customer."
Will definately go back the next time I am in the area.
"After reading the reviews here I dragged along my meat eating husband and brother to give it a try and yes, as has been said before truly excellent."
We ended eating here almost every day and we each had something different on the menu loving every dish!
Each main course was around 9-10 euro and deserts 5 euro.
"Lovely staff, highly recommended."
There is an underground car park around the corner which is handy.
"My boyfriend's family have been visiting the Marbella region for years, and have a property in the area."
"They have been to Finca Besaya a couple of times in the past, as has my boyfriend, and had rated it very highly."
"So on the last night of our holiday at the end of August this year (2008), we wanted to go for a special meal, and we decided on Finca Besaya."
"Firstly, on the positives, the property is absolutely lovely - it's a rustic old farmhouse, and has a beautiful bar area, with sofas and candles, it's very atmospheric, romantic and quite trendy (although it was quite empty when we were there, which we didn't mind....in hindsight I'm wondering if it was a bad sign, but at the time it was a Sunday night so we didn't question it)."
"The restaurant itself is large, with a few different areas to it, including an outdoor terrace, which was where our table was."
"The menu was ok, if a little uninspiring, but we didn't have trouble finding things we wanted to order."
"I ordered scallops to start followed by duck, and my boyfriend ordered carpaccio of beef followed by lamb."
"We asked about sides, and were told that the main courses came with jacket potatoes."
"In such an upscale restaurant, we were a little surprised, but accepting."
We also ordered some green beans on the side.
"When the starters arrived, they were ok."
Pretty standard.
"The carpaccio of beef seemed good quality, and what you would expect in an average restaurant."
"The scallops were cooked nicely, but they came with a kind of mayonnaise-like dressing, which just didn't work very well, and could easily have been Hellman's!"
"(in hindsight, I'm seriously wondering if it was)."
"I would have expected better, but it was all ""ok""."
"When the main courses came though, my duck was very overcooked, and really not very nice - tough and bland with no imagination or style in either presentation or flavour."
"The lamb was very rustic in feel, and was tasty, but we didn't feel the meat was particularly good quality, and again, it seemed just plonked on the plate, with no thought."
"There just wasn't very much going for either of the dishes, they were both quite boring and plain, and I actually sent my duck back due to it being so criminally overdone."
"The jacket potatoes were quite a shock though, because they came in tinfoil, on a saucer, with a dollop of sour cream."
"And quite frankly, they looked pathetic."
"They were quite dried out and lukewarm, as if they had been sitting around for a while."
"And our side order of green beans, were just piled on the same saucer as one of them."
"If had been served that at a Harvester, I would have been unimpressed, but would have thought ""well, what do you expect, it is a Harvester?""."
"When paying over 25 Euros per main course, at a place which is clearly trying to be a high-end restaurant, and certainly charging as if it is, I was disgusted."
"It isn't often that I feel moved enough to ask to see a manager, but this was definitely one of those times."
"But when we asked, we were told there were no managers there and the waitress was very unsympathetic, and took the attitude of ""there's no manager, nothing I can do, that's it....like it or lump it""."
I've had FAR superior service in a Pizza Express.
"So at a loss, we asked to see the chef, but were fobbed off again."
There didn't seem to be any sort of process or order to things.
"There were lots of waiters and waitresses milling about not really seeming to do much, but apparently no one in charge."
"When we got the bill, we found that the duck had been taken off, which I grudgingly accept was something."
"But it just didn't make up for it, because the bill was still very expensive, and we weren't even given an apology/explanation or even notified that it was being removed from our bill....which I think kind of goes against the point."
And the problem wasn't confined to one thing being overcooked.
It was really the whole meal and experience.
So we left very disappointed.
We've now warned the family and family friends who had been there before and recommended it.
"They were equally surprised at the turn-around of what had once been such a good place, and said they can only presume it must have changed hands."
"My boyfriend and I love our food, and we are spoiled in London, and have been lucky enough to eat in some fantastic restaurants all around the world."
I have never before been moved enough to write a review of a place either positive or negative until now.
"We only wish that we had gone with our other choice for that night, which was Pravda, in the port."
"We went there last year, and it was really nice!"
"A visit to this pastry store, is also a chance to see the highlights of the city of Valladolid recreated in sugar in their museum on site."
"Upstairs, artisans have recreated various sites, a fabulous sugar dream for children and adults alike."
"With immaculate restrooms in the basement, where you can also see the kitchens through large windows."
Absolutely delish-goodies to buy.
Don't miss it.
"Just off the Plaza Mayor, where there is parking."
We have eaten here on various special occasions over the years as Mas Torrent had a romantic charm when we first visited it about 10 years ago.
How it has changed!
we took some friends there earlier this month.
"The staff were unfriendly and rushed, the food was mediocre and the main course ( lamb) was served luke warm on cold plates."
"when we complained ,the plates were taken away for a few moments and returned with the same (now cold) lamb."
The sommelier was not good enough to recommend local wines and was helping out clearing tables!
for £80 a head this was very poor value for money and we won't be returning.
"Myself and my wife have been to Chill Out onseveral previous occasions,the last visit however was a dissapointment.There was a P.A."
outside as there is with most Restaurants nowadays in Tenerife.As we have been before we just walked straight in and acknowledged him as we entered.
"The food as always is of good quality,although not cheap it is consistant.We shared a Paella which was more than we could both eat at one sitting so we had a take out for lunch for us and some neighberhood cats the next day.After a leisurely and pleasant meal we left.We got about six feet when we were stopped by the P.A."
"and asked if we had eaten.We explained we had, in HIS RESTAURANT.We then went to the shop next door for a few minutes and then passe the Retsaurant again.Enter the same P.A to Ask the same question.Either the man is spectacularly stupid,or sees tourists as faceless nameless walking bags of money.there for his pecunary benefit.This mans stupidity and ignorance means that we will not be back in a hurry which is a shame as the food and ambience were good."
Cockroaches?
I find that hard to believe.
This was the best restaurant we found on our trip.
"It stands out a mile from all the others - furnishings, decor, price, ambience.....food."
Not a basket of chips or over cooked chicken (or cockroach) in sight.
"It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for."
They have a soul singer who is the best entertainment we had the whole holiday - absolutely fabulous voice.
GO.....you wont regret it.
This restaurant was taken over and remodeled by new owners about 2 years ago.
It is on the main square area on the front at Moraira.
It was previously called Las Palmeras.
"In winter they do a very good dinner menu for 25€ a head, which what we had."
"This is a 3 course menu with choice of 4 starters, 6 main courses and 3 puddings."
"They also throw in olives, a soup and a sorbet courses."
"I had a calimar starter, hake main course and a vanilla custard as pudding."
"The soup was pumpkin, and the sorbet mango."
"All were well presented and a treat to the eye, even before you started to eat them."
I should like to particularly commend the pleasant welcome and service from the Spanish owners.
"Large, well spaced out tables with white tablecloths, quality cutlery and first class wine glasses."
"The restaurant is right on the square, so you can get a good look inside before committing yourself."
"The wines are not cheap, but if that concerned you, you could always avoid buying a whole bottle."
"They shake you by the hand when you arrive and when you leave, and are genuinely pleased to see you in their restaurant, and will take the trouble to go along with my less than fluent Spanish."
All in all a very agreeable evening out with good food in very comfortable surroundings with excellent service.
"had a brilliant time met some great people in the ship fantastic fun atmosphere you name it they had it karen was a star,also great food."
would highly recomend.
DEAN AND LISA from LEICESTER.
Recently had dinner in zozoi with 3 others.
Was really looking forward to the experience as we had heard some really good comments about the place but we were so disappointed.
Food all in all was only ok- nothing special whatsoever.
The staff were again only ok-talk about the customer always being right!!!
My husband ordered an irish coffee and it took 3 conversations with 3 different members of staff before they replaced it with what he had ordered-not good enough for the prices they charge.
"Also found the wine prices to be very expensive, house wine is usually very good in an establishment such as this but not in this case, again very disapointing."
"All in all we were all very disappointed with our night, we have eaten in the orange tree, beckitts, albert & simon, brunnings, de brunos etc."
and we would rate them all far higher than zozoi.
El Reloj is part of a chain of restaurants all over Spain (I believe) but with hundreds in Barcelona - Look out for the bright neon blue signs on Via Laietana and Gran Via.
"However, El Reloj tends to be the best."
"Opens early (around 5am) - so when you're stumbling out of a club aching for a dirty kebab, ignore that urge and visit El Reloj and get yourself some Potatoes Bravas and the Hamburguesa El Reloj."
I lived in Barcelona for 6 months and the thing I miss most about the city is that damn burger.
In El Cenador Grill everything is good.
The food is exellent both the fish-dishes and meat.
"If you have a beefsteak with a baked potato, you will not be abel to eat more that night..You will not have room for any more."
"But it is like that with all the food, whatever your choise is."
The peppersteak or any kind of meat is melting in your mouth and you realy don't need a knife.
And you can have nearly any kind of fish you like.
Both the fish and meat are always fresh and good.
"The starters is also exellent, the shrimpcoctail is like no other I have tasted."
And the shrimps grilled in oil and garlic (gambas con ajioli) is wonderfull.
And for dessert I always take the Irish... loveley.
"The owner and his staff is extraordinary, and I have never before felt so important as a guest in any restaurant I've been to."
"Not home in Norway, and not abroad."
"They come around and talk to you, make jokes and are simpley loving and nice people."
"And you don't have to bee affraid if you dont speek spanish, they all speeks English and there are even a danish boy working there."
"(Good for us scandinavian people) I've been to many restaurants around the world, but this is simpley the best."
"And when we're down there, we always try other restaurants."
But we compare them whit El Cenador and always end up at El Cenador Grill.
"And food I know, I am very picky and I'm also a chef in Norway."
"It is a exellent place to have your children with you for dinner, you can chose smoke or no smoke."
Indoor or outdoor-you'r choise.
They arrange birthdays for you and you kan get food to take away.
It's recomended to make a reservation for table from october - march.
Just wisit the place and enjoy :-) I come back later with som pictures
This is a really delightful small family fun restaurant that has had a Michelin star rating for over 20 years.
The food is really good and less expensive than many other places.
You are made to feel so welcome.
This is a more sophisticated version of good old Kabuki.
It's located in a five star hotel in Madrid where the Toreros lodge during the bullfight season in Madrid.
"Don't get me wrong, it's expensive."
And worth every Euro.
"I have been there three times and the highlights are: butterfish with black truffle aroma nigiri, toro with ""pa amb tumaca"" sashimi (tomato and olive oil breadcrumb) and oxtail stew."
Be prepared to pay 60 to 70 euros and be sure to make a reservation well in advance.
Ambiance is chic and dressy
Very expensive obviously...location!
But the sunset plus atmotphere makes a great experience...to save money we bought cans of beer to drink on the beach which is what a lot of people do then just have a few in mambo and del mar.
My wife (who is a catering lecturer) have been using this restaurant since 2000.
You will not find better local cusine anywhere on the island.
The paella is to die for.On Sundays approx 300 paella portions are sold.
The friendly atomsphere makes it just one of those places where you just want to come back to time after time.
As always this restaurant lives up to it´s reputation.
Great fish served the local way.
"Try the fried sardines, pulpo (squid), calamaris, gofio (if you have not tried, it is the time) and a great paella."
"The atmosphere is nice, with a good mix between tourists and locals."
Do not be fooled by all the tourists; this place keeps it´s atmosphere.
Ask for a table next to the window for a great view.
Good chinese food.
Good service.
Totally enjoyed the food.
Service was great.
The Peppers stuffed with crab were wonderful.
"I don't eat Veal, but had the chop (OK, it is a baby cow, but I figure that the Spanish may farm better than American's do)."
One word-YUM.
"The only bad point, all the rice dishes--Paella, etc--are for two people."
A glorified Burger King.
Not even propoer mince burgers.
Place looks great but food was a major disappointment.
Avoid!
El Olivo is a very large terrace located in Dalt Villa.
"Food is very good, mediterranenan style."
I usually recommend this place to my friends.
We had read some articles on Trip Advisor describing authentic Catalunian cuisine and were excited to find La Fonda because it has several of these dishes listed.
On top of offering authentic cuisine the service was excellent and the food tasted AWESOME.
"They had plenty for a vegetarian to eat, including an amazing Goat Cheese salad and a plate of grilled veggies."
"The house wine was 2,50 euros for a half liter, which is crazy cheap."
"We recommend the duck, lamb and John Dory fish."
"Don't bother with the bread, it's 85 cents each and hard and cold."
All of their desserts are excellent as well.
"We went twice and always ordered a liter of white wine, two appetizers, two entrees and split a dessert and after tip we never paid more than 45 Euros."
It is barely a block off of La Ramblas making it easy to find and very convienent
Just back from Barcelona.
"Ate twice in the Citrus,the reason being the really friendly waiter called ""PAPA ""who made our evening so enjoyable.Even although he had lots of tables to serve, he went out of his way to be cheery and friendly.That made all the difference to our dining experience!"
Please ask for him and tell him the Scottish couple are asking for him!!
That would make his day!
"The nicest place to sit in this restaurant is by the window,but it is not easy to get such a seat unless you go early or late.The restaurant is open until after midnight!"
"The views onto the street are lovely,especially towards the Battlo.The food is not gourmet but we really enjoyed it-especially the fish soup!!"
"A word of warning.In Barcelona,dont carry anything in your pockets of any value.We would have lost the contents of our pockets in the metro at least once,but luckily we were aware of the problem and only lost a used metro ticket!"
We had a meal here on 17th October 2008.
We were staying at the Matchroom Heritage resort so it is just a short walk away down the hill.
We were a party of 5 with a 4 month baby.
The staff couldn't have been nicer and the food was delicious.
A tip though - if you want Paella you need to order the day before.
Good traditional Spanish food!
We stopped at Gonzalez about 11:30pm based on a write up in Rick Steve's Spain 2008.
It was very nice and quaint.
Even though they closed at midnight they gladly let us in.
We had the five cheese plate and some chorizo picante.
It was wonderful and we had the staff pick out the cheeses for us.
The added membrillo which was a great pairing with cheese.
They also have a well stocked wine cellar and this alone makes it a fun place to go to.
They serve wine by the glass as well.
There is a bar and restaurant in back.
We sat right in the window off the sidewalk.
This restaurant was very clean.
We would go here again.
Once again we have visited Agapanto and what a pleasure!
"This year we not only went to the restaurant for dinner at night, but also at daytime."
From June this year Agapanto have had a wonderful offer; beach club.
The place was my “health resort” during my 4 weeks holiday.
Much more relaxing than the other crowded beaches in the port.
"On the sandy beach in front of the restaurant you will find comfortable sun loungers, small tables and sun shades."
Impressive view over the bay and relaxing music.
"If you want to, the restaurants friendly staffs will serves you lunch and refreshments on the beach throughout the day."
The Andalusian Gazpacho soup is delicious on heated days.
"This soup was very tasty and cheap (€4,50) at Agapanto."
You can of course also visit the restaurant for lunch.
Every Saturday and Sunday from 12:00 to 14:00 hrs.
a local fisherman make paella outdoor.
You can follow the preparation.
In the evening Restaurant Agapanto have a fantastic atmosphere.
The ambience of the setting is enhanced by the use of candles.
Every Tuesday and Saturday from July to September this year the singer Aaron Lordson perform and make the evenings magic.
I’m sure he will be back in 2009.
We’re never disappointed when dining at Agapanto.
The food are always delicious and beautifully presented.
Have a look at the restaurants website for more information.
What can I say.
I love it!!
GO!!
!
After some good but expensive meals in Valencia we came upon Babalu by chance.
The menu was interesting - specialising in Caribbean food – with good prices.
The restaurant calls itself as chill-out place and the décor and laid-back salsa music was very relaxing.
The waiter/barman/maitre de was very friendly and likeable.
"We would recommend the mixed tapas starter, which was one of the nicest starters I have had for a while."
The main courses were huge.
Two of us the mixed meat selection served with two types of rice which again I would recommend.
"We drank quite a few cocktails (well it was our last night) such as mojitos, and pina coladas but were pleased with the cost of the bill when it arrived."
For something a bit different (Valencia seems to have hundreds of pizza and pasta restaurants) give this a try.
"Old world style restaurant with all the trimmings - lots of black-tie waiters, linenwear, silver service etc - on the first floor."
This adds considerably to costs and reflected in prices that the food does not match up to.
"Tournedos Rossini only dish that reasonable and even then a thin sauce and small & poor pate, although steak itself excellent."
Service was speedily efficient but not a place that seems to like tourists to linger altho' a table of locals giving more welcoming vibes.
I explained but they charged 34 Euro anyway.
No refund or discount.
I would not recommend to book advance.
or even going there.
"Person who was in charge of reservation repeated "" WE CAN'T"" What a great experience."
"I have eaten at Mariposa many times, lunchtime menu del dia is the best in the area (the tapas is not bad either) and the evening menu is vast with great veggie options if you like that sort of thing which we do."
"The service is polite and quick, the wine available is good for a small restaurant."
The restaurant can be quiet at times due to the fact it is halfway up a mountain but well worth booking in advance as it is also frequently full.
I would recommend this restaurant to my best friends without a second thought.
John and Francesca McClintock.
This restaurant was beyond excellent.
It is NOT a tourist destination; be prepared to use your Spanish and you won't be disappointed.
The paella was absolutely incredibly good.
"A Mexican couple we met on our travels told us that their relatives, who live in Barcelona, took them to this same restaurant as it is 'the best.'"
"Based on our experience, I truly believe that."
We started our meal with chorizo and gaspacho - both excellent and then had paella which was transcendent.
My wife doesn't even particularly like seafood and she loved it.
The mussels were easily the best I've ever had.
"In fact, they were probably the only ones I've ever had that I really liked."
"We sat at a table that was outside on the patio, about 150 feet from the lovely beach, so we sat and ate and watched the windsurfers and the people strolling on the beach."
It was really quite enjoyable.
"At the end of the meal, the waiter produced a bottle of some kind of spirit and poured us generous shots, walking away leaving the bottle and an assortment of cookies on the table."
Quite a nice way to end the meal.
There is a second restaurant on the opposite side of the street.
I would suggest eating at the one that fronts the beach just for the view and the experience.
We ate here three times in a week and the standard was always excellent.
"They cook good ingredients simply but perfectly, especially the fish."
Deserts are home-made and very good
The food wasn't worth near the price.
The food was the quality of Mcdonald's food.
Soy enduced things not worth much.
Buger King tastes beeter for a better price.
If ever there was a place that survives on its convenient location close to the Alhambra ticket office this must be it.
I had a thoroughly indifferent and overpriced meal with rather surly service.
Much more interesting was watching another couple's experience.
He ordered a steak very well done making it very clear that he did not want any pink at all.
Well each to his own; his request may not be to my taste but he was crystal clear about it and the waiter showed every sign that he understood.
They waited even longer than I and when the steak arrived he checked it and found it bloody inside and so called the waiter who took it away - so far so good.
After a further interminable wait a second steak arrived.
The man checked it and found blood again.
He called over the waiter again - and rejected the steak.
The waiter's response was to argue with him and push the plate back at the customer.
"The man had had enough and told them to cancel the order, that they would pay for his partner's food and the wine they had had but he would not pay for a steak (some €20) when they couldn't or wouldn't cook it as he had asked."
"The waiter, and then a couple others were demanding the money and threatening to call the police."
"The man encouraged them to do so, they were physically prevented from leaving but it is very clear that the Police were not called."
"The couple waited at their table then, after a further interminable wait, they put down money to cover the wife's meal and the wine and went to leave."
The waiter pounced on the money and found that it did not cover the steak and shouted for the man to be stopped.
"Three waiters, including the manager, physically manhandled the man to try to stop him leaving, others had to intervene and the couple were able to walk away."
Normally I have every sympathy for restaurant staff who have to deal with all sorts of customers.
However in this case the staff behaved absolutely disgracefully under the guidance of the manager and the man and his wife with considerable patience.
Make a point of avoiding this place.
Even if you are hungry and thirsty after visiting the magnificent Alhambra you can catch one of the very regular Alhambra buses down into the centre of the city and have a choice of wonderful restauants with fabulous staff.
"A casual place for locals, moderately priced."
"Excellent peppers (pimientos), either grilled and salted or with that delicious ventresca (tuna)."
"Good boquerones al vinagre, too."
"My friend speaks for the croquetas, which I personally have never much cared for."
But she says they're good.
"House wines are reasonably priced and perfectly fine, and the gruff but welcoming patron and his staff will steer you right."
"If you want more festivity and action, head for la Cerveceria Cruz Blanca, in the same neighborhood."
"If you want an evening of lively talk with your friends, eating raciones and half-raciones in a sit-down atmosphere (a very informal sit-down atmosphere!"
"), try Mariano."
First day in Mogan and took the short walk to the harbour.
We stumbled upon this restaurant and were delighted we decided to pop in for some food.
The service was great with the waiter describing the fish of the day which was cut open and grilled with plenty of garlic served with Canarian Potatoes and Mojo Sauce (local delicacy which tastes a bit like cold chilli).
We discovered that the owner of the restaurant has his own boat which is used daily to go out and catch the fish.
We didn't need anymore persuading.
"The waiter brought the fish out before the cooking started to show us the freshness and also tell us the weight, you don't get that back home in Essex !!!"
"The food was a delight, yes there were a few bones and i'm not usually one for fuss but i loved sitting there with my girlfriend having a quiet chat and enjoying the meal and of course a few pints of Tropical (Canarian Local Beer)."
If you choose this place you'll have a great meal.
For many years Merlin has enjoyed the position of being popular with a mainly gay clientele and its owners have played to the audience with their delightful friendly banter.
However the prices seem to have risen in tandem with it's rise in popularity.
In truth the food is average for the resort.
Veg and fish are likely to come from the freezer rather than fresh from the market.
The decor and ambience is typical mish-match spanish.
"Located on the gound floor of an apartment block, central on Tirajana, helps keep a steady flow of customers."
"After all the years it's still here, and I will sometimes pay a visit, but not as frequently as in the past."
"When the same quality of food and service cost a lot less, I would have considered it good value, but with so many other options available nearby I think it has lost its catchet."
A little out of the way this place was easy to find.
The service was welcoming and continued to be good.
My hisband really enjoyed the ox tail croquettes which are their speciality.
I had a cheese and nut entree which was delciious but much too large for a starter.
For mains we both had fish which was served in a traditional manner and was again delicious.
They had limited wine by the glass.
It cost 120E for 2 entrees and mains and 4 glasses of wine.
We tried to book this through the internet but they obviously dont use it.
The website said they have degustation menus but none were on offer.
A nice night out but we were a bit disappointed as we were looking forward to more innovative cooking based on the website.
They also had a tapas bar which seemed really popular.
"We asked our concierge at the Alfonso where to go for a non-touristy dining experience, and he didn't even hesitate to recommend Casablanca."
We walked in and the experience immediately began.
"It is a small place, bustling with locals who looked like they were enjoying an evening with friends and famliar faces."
The menu was only in Spanish and our server didn't speak a word of English.
"So between his recommendations and whatever culinary menu-reading experiences we had encountered, we ordered about 6 plates."
"It felt like you were having a meal in someone's kitchen...it was the best example of ""comfort food"" we came across during our entire trip."
"The plate sizes were true to ""tapas"" size and the server was very excited to contribute his suggestions as well."
The final tab with two drinks was about $40 (with $1.45USD to the EUR).
It was a great local experience!
"We had a wonderful meal here, the best of our holiday."
My steak was melt-in-the-mouth.
"Plentiful bread, olives, drinks on the house etc made it feel very good value - in fact it was no more expensive than other less good places closer to the beach."
"Service was charming, especially with the children."
It made a welcome change from other places in Santa Ponsa where the menu seems to be geared to what they think tourists want.
"Here, the emphesis is very firmly on producing delicious meals."
"Must agree a fantastic place ,great food ,fantastic service plenty of choice , a must"
My husband and I visited here on Sunday afernoon 12th October 2008 as we had been several times to other restaurants beside.
We thought we would give El Camion a try.
We were lead to our table by nice waiter but as the meal progressed the main waiter after I asked for napkins went 'off on one' in Spanish!
I did not understand any of it!!
But the spanish families beside us seem to understand it!!!!!
I was surprised to see disgust and astonishment on their faces!
We did mention to the Manager we would not be back.
As I always say speak with the feet!
But beware of the bald waiter dont ask for napkins use the table cloth instead---- only joking!
"REVIEWER......Ferretedinburgh RESTRAUNT.....Vista Sur, Playa de las americas Am on holiday as i write this now as i am so pleased and impressed with the restraunt VISTA SUR....Absoultley nothing can be faulted from price to service to quality of the food, all fantastis.Being a chef myself i very rarely find anywhere where it all fits together so well but at Vista Sur it dose."
Head waiter is friendly and professional as is the rest of the staff.
You can choose from a reasonably priced main menu or there is a set 3 course menu for 8 Euros 95.
"I find in a lot of places the food from set menu to be of average or poorer quality and fails on presentation or portion size or both ,not here !!"
"Our party of 5 had a mix of starters ..soup chicken veg ..really nice,garlic bread, perfect..lovely fresh salad...... 2 huge very succulent and tender pork chops,with chips and salad..LOVELY..sirloin steak cooked as you like it ..same comment as the pork chops...Veal escallop .. again perfect..Ice cream to finish and a free shot to round off the meal...Cant say any more other than TRY IT !!!"
Will update this and add map and pics when i get back to edinburgh
La Oca is a busy restaurant which specialises in chicken dishes which you'll see from the well loaded rotisseries that greet you as you enter.
"Don't be put off if the welcome you get from the chickens as they roast, is warmer than the one you receive from the staff."
"You will find that La Oca is not the place to go for a long, meandering meal in an intimate setting."
"Instead you will see that it is a bustling, often noisy place with the ample number of waiters rushing around at pace."
The pace is such that your food will be delivered to you promptly and as soon as you are finished the plate whisked away and a desert menu presented in it's place.
"This speed of service may make you feel that you should rush your meal and leave as quickly as possible so the next customers can be seated, fed and so on and so forth."
"On the plus side the staff are friendly enough, although their business can mean they sometimes come over as aloof, and the food is good and reasonably priced."
"We normally use La Oca if we find ourselves looking for somewhere for a quick, inexpensive meal and normally visit at least once each time we stay."
Tartana is in the grounds of the neighboring hotel.
"Both are German owned and run, and so tends to attract a larger than normal proportion of German clients."
"However they are happy to serve you in Spanish, English or German!"
"The pizzas are pizzas, not gourmet pizzas but I don't think I have ever come across gourmet pizzas."
The ambiance is good and the service pleasant.
The owners are on hand to oversee everything.
"Oh, and it is quite cheap, as most local pizza places here are."
I guess it is the combination of value for money and caring service that makes us like this restaurant.
"We came out thinking we had had a nice evening out, which is as it should be when you go to a restaurant, but often is not."
"After 2-1/2 weeks touring Spain, we wanted to wrap up our journey with a memorable meal."
"We asked the hotel for a recommendation that would meet our requirements: within a 10-minute walking distance, quiet, not toooo expensive, with excellent food and good service."
We couldn't be more pleased.
"In contrast to several of our other Spanish dining experiences, the service was excellent."
The English/French menu was much appreciated and the server spoke English well enough to answer all our questions.
"From the olives and bread to the chef's special teaser-tasters to our salads to the entrees to the little dish of sweets at the end, every morsel was delicious."
My husband's cannelloni was melt-in-your-mouth perfect.
My fish couldn't have been more delicious.
"My husband, a connoisseur of apple tarts, said this was the best he had ever tasted."
"It's a small restaurant in a neighborhood, not part of the busy tourist scene."
A real gem to be discovered!
I'd really strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Jerez.
"We had a gone on a bit of a tapas crawl on the night we arrived and, to be honest, were very disappointed with poor selections and mediocre food."
We just happened upon Meson del Asador as we walked back to our hotel and popped in for a beer.
You can only get tapas at the bar and there was a little bit of a wait but it was well worth it.
"I was already full when we went in and I still put away black pudding, beans, bull's tail and anchovies."
It's lively; filled as much with locals (at least they all seemed to know the staff so I'm guessing they were) as much as with tourists.
The food was great and the staff friendly and chatty.
We headed back the following night for a full sit-down meal and weren't disappointed.
We had two great nights there and I'd say I'd actually put it higher than the sherry bodega tours as a place to go in Jerez.
As a business traveller I have been in fine restaurants in many countries and had worked in the industry in the USA for many years.
This is truly on par with the best in the world.
I was a guest of a local company at a small business dinner.
"Without being pretentious, the restaurant has an air of being a great destination."
The food and the menu choices were mouth watering.
This place may have been the nicest place in which I have dined.
The service and presentation of the food complemented the overall experience.
We walked through the square one night in mid September and saw the queue so went back the following day and tried to book a table.
The restaurant doesn't do pre-bookings so you have to queue for a table when they open for the evening at around 8:00 p.m.
The menu is quite varied and prices very reasonable and it seemed to attract both tourists and locals.
"Service is quite brisk; presumably to ensure a quick turnround of tables but we enjoyed the evening and thought the wine list offered particularly good value although, be warned, bread is delivered to your table and then charged for on the bill - something that we didn't expect but the overall cost is still excellent."
We found it lively and busy and thoroughly enjoyed our evening.
This restaurant always seems to have a queue outside so you are tempted to go in .... but don't .
Of all the restaurants we visited during our stay this was by far the worst.
You soon realise when you get in there are no spanish diners and the food although reasonably priced is of very poor quality.
In my opinion the only item that hadn't been previously frozen was salad .It is a shame as the restaurant itself is in a very beautiful square and actually looks very nice and inviting.... unfortunately if you are looking for decent food you have to look elsewhere .Pity
Amazing food here.
You know what a long line means!
Their food prices are reasonable and the tucked away location is very cozy...especially if you eat outside.
My husband and I spotted this while waiting for the mini bus across the street and decided to give it a try.
"We were both very impressed with the food, friendly waiter and menu."
We took the advise of our waiter and ordered the black ravioli with mushroom sauce with bleu cheese.
It was amazing.
We highly recommend this restaurant.
This restauant is at the end of the resort furthest from the Harbour.
Don't be confused as they serve Indian and Italian!
We found the food to be very good and plenty of it - we ordered far too much!
Service was good - if anything a little quick between our starters and main course.
Wouldn't say the staff were overly friendly but not rude either.
We enjoyed our meal here and would recommend it!
We asked at our hotel for a recommendation and we were not disappointed.
"A local house overlooking the harbour, you dine in one of a number of rooms."
We chose the 19E fixed evening meal which was good value and included a half bottle of good wine each.
Much more expensive menu selections are also available.
Friendly family service: the lady of the house was originally from San Fransisco USA.
I'd read about this on TA and couldn't wait to try it.
It's a lovely tapas bar with a great choice and attentive service.
"There are many wines, ports and tapas to chose from."
The free tapas we got were so lovely we just had to add to them and ended up staying in there the whole evening.
Somehow we both had a hangover the next day!!!
Recommended if you want to feel like a local.
Others rave about the cochinillo but for us it was a great disappointment.
"It was certainly very tender, but that is the only positive thing we have to say about it."
It was bland apart from being extremely salty to the point of becoming unpalatable half way through such a large portion of meat served by itself (to be fair this is not unusual in this part of Spain).
There did not seem to be any option to have anything with it other than bread.
"That said, of our starters and deserts 3 of the 4 were excellent, and the other good - as was the house red wine both in terms of quality and value for money."
There was a friendly atmosphere although the service was a bit rushed.
"If I was in Segovia again I would consider going here again, but would not have cochinillo."
The rating I give is a compromise between much less for the conchinillo and more for the rest of the meal.
"I live in Jerez, and work quite close to this place, however I only found out about it a couple of months ago, and finally got to try it the other day with some friends."
"It's not on a main street, but it is in the city centre sort of area, and you could walk pass it and not realize that there is a restaurant there, so you really have to go there looking for the place."
"The building is an old restored Bodega, and a little section of it has been turned into the dining area, it's normally not very full (mainly cause of it's location I imagine), and they open from 7:30 PM which is really early for Spanish restaurants, so if you are used to having an earlier dinner this is a good choice."
"We tried the ""Novillo Argentino"" (argentinian baby bull) and the Ostrich..."
Both of which were tender and juicy.
"The people who work there are Argentinian, so they know what they are doing."
The pancake dessert is also really nice.
"All in all, a full course meal only cost just under 30 Euros per head, so it is really good quality for money."
I know I'm going back there!
The best meal of my life.
Had the Joan Roca tasting menu with wines for every course.
it was OUT OF THIS WORLD.
Fantastic service.
Beautiful surrondings .Go there.
Quite busy when we were there but decent sized tables in the two rooms surrounded by a quirky collection of agricultural tools and other nicknacks.
"We had Goulash with rice ,and a chicken dish with the desert as ""Mato con Miel"" a Catalan speciality of dry crumbly cheese curd with honey - yummy."
"House wine at €7.50 ""Bodega Adrian"" Good food , well cooked and presented and good value at €35."
Looked busy every time we passed but I realise that must be it's location rather than food quality.
Service was incredibly quick - but not in a good way.
It felt like we were being rushed out so they could fill our table again.
My lamb was ok but overpriced for what it was.
Husband was very disappointed with his monkfish.
Childrens pasta fine but unexeptional.
There are better places and cheaper places to eat in Santa Ponsa
I went in March 2008 out of season and it wasnt very busy.
My friend and i had two very good experiences in this place.
I did feel it was slightly over priced but we had two good nights so we didn't care.
The food was good and so was the wine.
The waiters were very friendly and even wanted to pour my ketchup for me!
I would say to give it a try.
"iv'e been visiting santa ponsa for over 20+ years and every time i have been i have always paid a visit to jackies and never have been disapointed in service or food , the staff have always been freindly, i must say having watch santa ponsa change over the years and a lot more restraunts and english irish bars taking over the resort and a loss of places like the victoria which was next to jackies also pepe's that was in the resort have gone which is a shame."
But if you want to visit jackies go ahead and yes it does get busy so either go early or after the rush if your picky make a reservation .
I would reccomend the steak and roast chicken but all the food is good imop.
For a starter i personaly like the chicken pate what i would give for the recipie.
so be brave go spanish at this local and long running restruant.
I persuaded my partner to visit this restaurant this holiday despite him having a bad meal there last year.
Unfortunately we won't be returning to Tio Bernabe next year.
Both meals well below the standards we expect in Corralejo.
If you do one thing in Santiago (apart from visiting the cathedral!)
then eat at this restaurant.
However make sure it is open as it has strange opening times and pre-book as I have no doubt its reputation will grow and grow.
"The menu is fixed and there are no choices, so you get what you get, therefore it may not be to everyones taste."
The kitchen is completely open and it is more like a The Chefs Table experience.
Now to the star...the food.
The menu is an 8 course tasting menu.
"The day we were there the menu was:- - Mousse of advocado, salmon and anchovies with Rosemary crisps - Mushroom foam with mushroom broth - Carpaccio of Tuna with tomato jelly - Rice noodles with mashed potato enfused with squid ink and sesame seeds - Steamed vegetables on a steamed egg yolk with cheese sauce - Steamed hake with clear green pepper broth - Pina Colada (coconut snow with pineapple ice cream) - Deep fried milk with palm sugar crust Believe me when I say that these descriptions do not do the food justice!"
This menu was 60 euro.
In addition the wine list was superb and very reasonably priced and the serving staff of the highest calibre.
What more can I say!!!!
!
"Delicious food, excellent service, reasonably priced."
Pleasant terrace with a view in the summertime.
Do not miss it when in Besalú!
If you go to Puerto Calero you have to eat here at least once!
We where staying all inclusive near by and went here for a change!
What can I say!
The food is out of this world!
The service is amazing!
And the location!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is not cheap but its not overpriced!
As a guide expect to pay 120 euros for 2.
"This includes a drink before, 3 courses and a bottle of wine!"
And of course the fantastic view!
Go and try it!
If you like good food you will love it!
We went twice!
!
On first impressions the All White (and i mean everything is white) decor looked like a case of style winning out over substance.
I am glad to say that this was not to be the case.
The menu allthough a little bit on the fruity side was well balanced.
Food was superbly presented and the service top notch.
So full marks to the chefs who are producing food of such high quality and the front of house team who were friendly and efficient.
At 100 euros + gratuities for two starter's two mains 1 dessert wine & coffee we thought it was value for money It is worth a look inside as there are several dining areas (again all in white) which could be a backdrop for a Ralph Lauren photo shoot.
All in all a very pleasent experience.
George Bartov
Went here with friends (a party of 6).
Nothing was too much trouble.
Everything about this restaurant was excellent.
The service was very quick and efficient.
All our needs were catered for.
The food was superb.
It has a reputation for the best Dover Sole and we were not disappointed.
We would happily go back there again and again.
Minotauro is on the Carrera as you walk up to the Albaicin alongside the Darro River gazing up at the Alhambra.
It is just an ordinary bar but order a beer and along comes some tapas - traditional style.
"First beer brought a mini kebab with olives and crisps, second beer brought a mini roll with a slice of steak and the third brought a mini hamburger that would make a London hostess looking for new canapes weep."
Each beer was under €2.
Staff charming.
"Actually some of the best, and most freshly cooked, food I have had in Spain"
"This bright, buzzy tapas bar served simply the best tapas I had ever had."
From my bar stool I watched the staff carefully slice thin jamon and joined in with the locals to partake in price colour-coded plates of cold tapas.
"My meal consisted of a juicy langoustine, really good patatas bravas, a piping hot casserole of spicy octopus and anchovies with peppers on bread."
A really happy dining experience for about 25 euros.
"The food is fresh, very good quality and a nice alternative to spanish tapas."
Very Spanish clientele and therefore very noisy !!
"We shared a variety of starters, grilled green asparagus and a mixture of small canapes and some scrambled egg with blood sausage..all delicious."
The main course we ordered a T-Bone steak which came on a hot sizzling plate with course salt.
"The desserts are nice small portions which they bring past on a tray, so you can select... a very good meal and also a great place to stop by when you are peckish and just have a snack at the bar !"
!
It's okay I suppose.
The building and decor are sublime but I don't agree with the caged birds in the garden.
The thing that spoilt it for me was the rude waiter who had to drag himself to our table and who then looked aghast when we only ordered wine and not cocktails.
He wasn't having an 'off-day' as he had been just as obnoxious two years ago.
As we left he practically sprinted to the table to see what size tip we had left.
I suspect he is still looking.
JTH GB
excellent!
not as noisy as the other Kibuka.
"La Balsa came highly recommended so perhaps our sights were a bit high, however it was ""just okay""."
"As a caterer and restauranteur for my entire adult life, I expect a certain level of quality at specific price ranges."
"The food was acceptably good, but the presentation was severely lacking."
"At $19 euros for an appetizer course of four grilled shrimp that would be considered 26-30 count in the U.S., I would expect more than just four shrimp on the plate and a small sprig of parsley."
Really now.
Perhaps a sauce or condiment?
Perhaps a bit of insiration?
"While the food was fine and the service decent, there was absolutely no inspiration or excitement present."
"The ingredients were all fresh and the flavors fine, but the meal was simply unimpressive."
This kitchen and restaurant are just tired at this point I think.
we had a great welcome here while staying at hotel vistamar next time we will stay here in apartments meals excellent service first class friendly and attentive staff we came to regard as friends our family was welcome here at any time and encouraged to use swimming pool free owner suggested wines and also served liqueurs free after every meal menu varied and always to a high standard
Just got back from a fortnights break in Alcudia.
"This restaurant was great, our party of 4 ate here for eight nights and all had different dishes, not one of those 32 different dishes were unacceptable and the service was spot on."
I personally had one of the best steaks I have ever eaten and a perfect paella.
Can't wait to go back.
Bodega Es Port is a fairly authentic Spanish restaurant near the marina.
The sefvice is good and the food is excellent - I'd especially reccommend the seafood paella.
We found 3 other restaurants locally much better and a lot cheaper.
This place is always busy Why we never discovered but we would not go there again.
The service is fussy and of the 3 dishes we had we could not describe any as acceptable.
This is one of my favourite restaurants in this area.
"Quite expensive but very exclusive as is the name its a country club nestled behind all the villas of bena vista, etc."
Is quite difficult to find if you don't know where to go.
The setting is lovely overlooking a swimming pool.
The steak on a stone is to die for.
Booking is usually essential.
We were in Seville the first week of September and this place was recommended to us by someone in our hotel.
"It was perfect weather to sit at the restaurant's outside tables for lunch, but that was about it."
"The menus were dingy and gross, there were flies all over th place and the menu options were purely for big eating."
"It's probably okay if you want paella, but almost every non-paella option was something fried, which is what we weren't looking for."
Portions were a bit too big and it was just way overpriced.
"The only thing I would recommend is the cinnamon ice cream, which is why I gave it more than a rating of 1."
I'd skip it...
This is on most of the travel guides as one of the better restaurants but dosent deserve to be.
The service was poor.
"it took a long time for initial service and then the food arrived in less than 5 minutes, almost like it was prepared on a production line."
I had a thin steak with lots of fat and gristle.
The waiter didnt wait to ask how I wanted it cooked.
"It came medium, which is overcooked as far as I am concerned."
It came with a bit of salad on the plate and chips.
Its what I expect from a pub or a cafe which is not how this restaurant presents itself.
"They do specialise in fish, so perhaps we odered the wrong thing."
We wouldl not go back.
"This place seems to be busy most of the time although I can't see why, the worst meal of the holiday."
Won't be bothering to go here again.
I had a very tough steak my partner had a mixed grill.
Service was pleasant enough.
"My friends and I found the restaurant accidentally, but it was one of the best experiences for our vacation in Spain."
The 1st impression was the lovely decoration!
You can see the chef's cooking your order neatly in the open kitchen which I never saw this style for Thai restaurants in the US before.
"Of course, their homemade-like food that gave us very fresh- yummy-authentic dishes was the second impression."
"We started with ""Sa-tay Gai,"" and ""Larb Gai"" following by main dishes ""Pad-Thai"" ""Panang Nua"" and ""Sweet and Sour Prawn."""
"Moreover, when they say spicy, they mean it!"
"But they can fix any level of spicyness for your taste buds...If you love Thai food..""Bangkok Cafe"" is a must!!!!"
I guarantee!
We wanted a change from the Spanish restaurants in Segovia all of which seemed to offer very similar menus with main courses consisting of large portions of meat - or fish - sitting on the plate by themselves.
This was the only alternative we found that was a true restaurant rather than a cafe.
Without very high expectations we went to an American restaurant to have less meat!!!!
"All three courses we had lived up to the standards of, say, a Hard Rock Cafe and the hamburger one of us had (OK it was meat, but not only meat) was of good quality."
I would consider going here again if it was in my home town - and not only as a last resort in Segovia.
"Whilst staying in Moraira in March '08, we visited The Olive Tree restaurant 3 times and loved every minute of it."
"The owner-staff were pleasant, courteous and eager to please."
"I can appreciate the viewpoint of the previous reviewer - the staff were very chatty with their regulars, which can lead to newcomers developing a sense of feeling unwanted - however, we made an affort to chat with the owner-staff and found them to be friendly once the ice was broken."
I guess after our second visit we too became regulars!
The menu was simple but the food was first class.
"A little pricey for some, perhaps - but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
"I can cheerfully recommend the Green Tai Curry, which was simply the best of its kind I have ever tasted."
"I celebrated my 42nd Birthday in the restaurant and had no complaints about the charming ambience, delightful staff or splendid grub."
"Rest assured, if we ever return to Moraira, the Olive Tree will be our first port of call once hunger strikes!"
"Big chairs, lots of space between guests & other tables, even when they are packed, which is often."
"Very kind, funny and helpful staff."
The owner is very welcoming.
"Comfortable, very authentic Italian style, good customer service."
The food is very good but a little bit overpriced in my opinion.
"For example, a dish of pasta is around 15€ and the amount is just OK."
"Absolutely fantastic tapas, good service, good location - what more can i say?"
"We only went there for lunch on our last day, mainly because every time we passed it in the evening there was a queue spilled out onto the street of waiting diners - both early and late evening - which i always take to be a sure sign of good food (rather than slow service)."
"buenas tapas, quizá un pelín caras, pero es lógico porque está en un sitio turístico."
Excellent resturant - quality food at an affordable price - not horribly cheap but very nice.
Bad Service but cheap price.
"Wonderful food, service and surroundings."
What more can you ask.
I would recomend this resturant to anyone who did want really good food while on holiday.
Courtyard inside is lovely.
Ate at this resturant twice while in Puerto de la Cruz and only wish it had been more often.
We recently had lunch at this stunning restaurant in Deia.
The food was amazing and the service friendly and relaxed.
We sat on the terrace looking out over the village.
It was one of the best meals we have ever had with great quality products.
"The chef, Josef, came out after our meal to have his photo taken for a magazine."
"He was very friendly and, although an amazing chef, not a big head like some others we could mention."
Having read a forum post recommending this restaurant it sounded just what we were looking for - we were not disappointed.
The ambiance/decor/staff and food was excellent value for money.
We had Lunch - which is prepared and served by the students of the catering college.
For €12.90 you get a choice from a selection of 5 starters/ 10 mains ( 5 fish/5 meat dishes) and 5 desserts.
All wonderfully presented and just the perfect portion size for lunch.
We were a party of 7 - we had two bottles of wine/soft drinks and water and the total bill was €130 - excellent value.
We will be back.
This restaurant was just what we were looking for.
We wanted to take some locals out for a meal to thank them for their hospitality while we stayed with them in Barcelona.
We had seen this restaurant recommended in a travel guide and it stated that it was frequented by locals.
This appealed to us as we did not want to take our guests to a place filled with tourists for our thank you meal.
It was everything we could have expected.
The restaurant is famous for its Catalan based rice dishes and they did not disappoint.
It has about 20 tables and opens a 9PM so they usually only get one setting per table per night as the social pace means that a meal may take up to 3 hours.
We had a selection of tapas including grilled squid which was divine.
"The Paella with squid ink was the best I have had and the rice Milanese dish with the pork, chicken and cheese with rice was fantastic."
"The whole meal of 5 tapas, 6 main courses, 6 deserts, coffee, wine and cava came to a total of 230 Euros which we thought was very reasonable."
Our hosts were surprised they had not heard of it as they would definitely go back again and take their friends with them.
Great service... good food... good wine... good company... what more could you ask for :)
It's always challenging to travel as a vegetarian.
Especially in a country like Spain where every dish contains Jamon.
However Vegetalia was a life saver for me.
"After a week of eating pasta or tomatoe salads, this restaurant provided me with a place to get pita and hummus, black beans and rice, veggie spring rolls, tempeh kababs and more."
The great part is that their menu contains enough normal sounding dishes that my non-veggie husband was comfortable eating there as well.
"They had delicious vegan brownies, vegan wheat beer and fantasitc organic tea collection."
They even had honey!
I highly recommend this place for Vegetarians and Organic lovers while in Barcelona.
"From Las Rambla, walk uphill from the Drassanes Metro stop."
Take a right onto Escudellers into the Gothic Quarter.
"Wen you come to Placa Orwell, Vegetalia will be in the right hand corner of the placa on the right."
"The placa is full of Bohemian sorts at night, they look intimidating but they're harmless and quite nice, don't let them scare you away."
"La Boveda is well-known and well-attended by tourists, but its wood and tile interior and obvious care with the food doesn't make this a menu turistico trap."
"You must try the baby squid - simply the most tender, juicy squid I've ever had."
"The cod croquettes were so good that I couldn't bear to leave them uneaten, so took them on the plane with me."
"The bill also included chorizo al vino (great with bread) and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, and came to 24.50 euros."
"Booked a table for friday, it was so good we came back on sunday to try something different - and get some more tuna nigiri."
"It is a great place, great food and good service!"
We went here on a Monday night after reading about Casa Lucio in Loui Vuitton's travel guide of Spain.
We did not need a reservation but it did get busy.
We showed up at 8:30 and nobody was at the bar and we were the third table to be seated and by 9:15 it was packed.
The food was very good.
It's a very cozy place and we sat on the main floor at the tables in the middle of the room on the same level as the bar and the kitchen.
The service was fine.
Do not go there expecting to be pampered.
Won't happen.
Not that kind of restaurant.
"However, the food was cooked most excellently."
We had huevos con papas fritas with red sausage (Chistorria).
Very tasty and leave the ketchup at home.
Don't need it!
We acknowledged the kitchen staff on the way out and they seemed genuinely pleased that we told them in Spanish that we loved the food.
We would go there again.
Sample prices from our meal.
S. Iberico Ham and chorizo plate 20 euros Huevos with fries and red sausage chistorria 9.50 euros Campillo reserva rioja wine 2001 20 euros
i and my family have been many times to china garden excellent food the service is second to none the best place in benidorm to eat is china garden from tony fisher and all is family
Situated in the Bena vista complex.
Food is ok.
"Geared towards the tourists, but quite spanish."
Unfortunately the table are situated either side of a busy pathway so you tend to get a lot of people walking along having a good look at what you are eating.
A real gem of a restaurant.
Food is excellent and has many original twists.
Informal dining in a relaxed setting.
Service is attentive and friendly.
I didn't like this place one bit.
There was only 1 family of locals when I went - otherwise it was packed with tourists.
The food (spinach/chickpea dish and chewy!
cod with tomato sauce) was over salty and almost inedible because of it.
Pleasant enough ambience wise but I don't recommend going to this establishment.
I have eaten in Con Gracia on several occasions and found the food and service excellent every time.
"The menu layout is great, especially the tasting menu."
The chef's suprise menu is also spot on.
I would recomend this restaurant to anyone.
Came here on my school's Barcelona trip as it was in a nice and quiet location.
The food was superb and I paticually enjoyed the chef's suprise menu.
The wine was good (even though I only had half a glass.
I am recommeding this resturant to others coming to Barcelona.
It is superb!!
!
"This is a quality place so don't expect much change out of 200 euros for a 3 course meal with 2 bottles of wine, the service is 5*, food and atmosphere is great, the head chef came and asked us how the food was and had a quck chat, great view ovevrlooking the habour,   If you want quality and are prepared to pay for it  it is well worth it."
Restaurant Sa Capella is one of the most highly regarded and admired restaurants on the Island of Ibiza.
"Highly professional service, from staff that have worked there for decades."
"Its kitchen is renowned for producing top quality mediterranean ,Ibicenco food."
"Fresh, imaginative and indulgent."
"The ambiance reeks of character, in a traditional and rustic style, that stays loyal to the non-consecrated 16th century church ,that houses the restaurant."
"Its wine cellars are new, and filled with the fresh and vibrant wines of ""new spain""."
"They also stock the old favourites but its new owner has introduced a fresh ,expert, taste for excellent wines, that you wont read about in the fashionable magazines."
"Marriage proposals are regular occurrences here, in the belfry area of the restaurant, such is its romantic appeal."
"The staff and management work really hard, to ensure that your experience is special, this is why Sa Capellas reputation is so good."
"The menu is not overly expensive, but not cheap either, expect to pay €150 for two, sampling the best from the menu with wine."
"Sa Capella also serves the best Heirbas on the Island, complimentary to your table as a digestife, after your meal."
"If you want to experience a special meal in a wonderful ambiance, with professional service, then Sa Capella is the place for you."
Dress code is casual but neat (no shorts or t-shirts!)
"Just come back from a weekend in Barcelona with my wife and 4 friends and we were lucky to have stumbled across this little gem on Saturday night and we managed to nab the last table available which was at 8.30 but had to give it back by 10.45 - (this was managed well by everyone without us feeling we were hurried) Service - informal, attentive, friendly and extremely efficient."
Our waiter was from France although his accent wasn't identifiable and his English was great.
Taking orders and delivering food without having to ask ' who ordered the .....' is normally a good sign of a restauranteur knowing what should happen front of house and meals were despatched efficiently and with a smile.
The maitre d' from Catalan although again we would never have guessed and his wine recommendations for both white and red were met very enthusiastically by everyone and were really exceptional for the money 18e & 21e per bottle.
Food - Everyone had something different and to a man we could not find fault with anything.
Stand out dishes were the days special - mushroom risotto with truffle and the excellent executed fillet beef.
Desserts and cheeses were equally good and the glass of martini with a fruit foam and vodka and basil jelly was reminiscent of the Fat Duck!
"Ambience - eclectically decorated, low lit with a variety of lighting types - candles, spots, fairy lights etc, without being too dim."
Lots to look at and spread over 2 floors but everyone was in view.
It really makes you feel comfortable straight away.
"All in all, we walked out feeling extremely pleased with ourselves and the chefs ability to fuse a lot of flavours together is testament to his ability."
Cost 360e for 6 of us for 4 courses and 4 bottles of wine - extraordinary value for money.
There may be some 'finer dining' experiences on offer in the city but you will be hard pushed to find a restaurant that can deliver the quality of cooking on offer at Pla for the money.
Go see asap.
"This report is based on a stay at the hotel in October 2008, involving dinner at El Jardin del Califa three times in the evening, and seven breakfasts too."
"The restaurant has some cellar rooms deep under the main hotel, and two garden areas."
The garden areas are used for breakfast.
"One is open air, in a leafy courtyard."
"The other is an enclosed area, which has a long glass wall facing the courtyard."
The glass panels can be folded back in warmer weather.
The food is mostly Moroccan.
"The wine list is mostly Spanish, with some Lebanese choices."
"The athmosphere is romantic in the evening, with oil lamps and torches providing much of the light."
"Wet days were a problem, as there is not enogh space if the outdoor area can't be used."
Sharing tables for breakfast might be required.
"Breakfast includes yogurt, cheese, cold meat, bread (with self-service toast), fruit, and even cereals."
"Service was generaly good, but it is a bit annoying to be asked for a room number by the same lady every single day."
Surely after six days she might recognise a guest?
"An unassuming restaurant on the corner of Pl George Orwell, with hams adorning the window."
"Staff friendly and helpful, and the food and wine, although basic, were wholesome and well prepared."
"Most of the customers seemed to be Spanish, which we took to be a good sign."
The bill also came as a pleasant surprise.
Definitely worth a try for good casual dining.
Tapas with flair and orginality in this charming bar.
"Swedish, Thai and middle eastern influences are amongst the many touches that were brought to our meal."
The artistry on the plate was also something that pleased the eye!
Stunning salads that are very good value for money and good for sharing.
Deserts are also excellent here on the basis of our visit.
The service was very attentive and friendly.
Would highly reccomend it.
"Great food, and most of the time great service"
I'm a regular visitor to Puerto Del Carmen and have been to this restaurant a few times over the years.
"I went initially as it was recommended by our holiday rep. That time the food was good (albeit expensive) and although we thought the staff were a bit rude, we gave them the benefit of the doubt...e.g."
maybe they were having a bad night!
However having gone back 2 or 3 more times the manners of the staff has now gone from bad to worse.
They really treat customers badly and don't deserve any custom.
"As such, my wife and I will never return."
"Interestingly, I have have spoken to several other other Lnzarote regulars who say the same about this restaurant."
Do yourself a favour and avoid!
Got married in the nearby Santa Maria del mar church and truly loved this city.
The night before we had a family dinner in La Luna for about 25 people and it worked out very well.
The food was great.
"I had the Fillet steak with a gorgonzola sauce, asparagus and potato gratin."
"The atmosphere to this place is very special, it used to be the old stables of the nearby Basilica and it has a great atmosphere with suttle lightening and good staff."
The night we were there a chello player accompanided by a flute and madeline came in about 11.00 and it was extra special.
All in all a great place to dine in Barcelona.
After 12.00 the front of the bar was busy and a good place to drink a few cocktails that this city is famous for..
"Salamanca is a wine city, no doubt about it, and there are a number of terrific wine bars to stop into before heading up to the Plaza Mayor or where ever your luncheon destination may be."
"Casa de vinos doctrinos is a welcoming spot where you can sample a range of wines by the glass, keeping yourself steady with pinchitos (canapes) of some excellent meats and cheeses."
Glasses are quite reasonably priced --between 2-3 euros.
The staff and the patrons may have some cheerful debate regarding which wines you should try.
"Put yourselves in their hands, and try to remember to take notes!"
These are varietals we don't run into much --if ever-- outside of Spain.
So it's nice to experiment.
This is definitly a good restaurant - no question about that.
Still we found it to be overpriced by a far margin and service to be average at best.
All dishes were ranging between good and superb.
In terms of quality of food this is still a very good place.
However the good reviews in sites like this seems to have driven the price even higher and the service a bit lower.
"We were very surprised to find that our waiter would/could not explain the cost of our meal (""this is a tasting*)."
Even when asked multible times we were not given an answer.
Vaule for money is not found here.
Excellent food still is - but then again there are a lot of excellent restaurants in Barcelona.
My husband and I have been to Puerto Pollensa for many holidays and like to try different apartments and hotels.
The same goes for restaurants.
"We found this litte gem near the harbour, on the pedestrian street behind the Tabac shop."
We first found it on the Monday and just looked at the menu.
"It was filled with both home-comfort food, such as Steak and Ale Pie and fresh fish."
But also had an asian influence on some dishes.
We went back on the Tuesday evening and was amazed at the comfortable seating and ambience the restauarant had.
Proper chairs with cushioned seats was a definate plus after the rickety wood or garden type furniture you normally see.
Also the tables were well spaced.
This restaurant is not the biggest we have been to but with seating for 30 inside and about 12-14 outside was reasonable sized with sufficient space to move between.
The toilets were also extremely clean and had nice little touches like hand cream and facial tissues.
"The staff were friendly and not pushy, giving you enough time to look at the menu and make your choice."
The food was amazing my husband had the Steak and Ale pie and I had the fresh Fish of the day (Seabass).
"The food was cooked to perfection and I honestly can find a fault, except maybe the size of the fish, it was huge!"
"A no time did we feel rushed, in fact, they were more than happy for me to sit there for a good 40mins before I had room for desert."
I had the banana bread and butter pudding which was again homemade and was delicious.
Overall we enjoyed our visit so much that we went back on the Thursday.
I cannot recommend this little gem highly enough.
"First of all, there is a 20% surcharge for sitting outside...how dumb is that?"
"We ordered paella to share amongst two people, which was okay, but not worth the highway robbery incurred."
"The server was pretty friendly, but it was just so disappointing in terms of what you get for your money."
There are plenty of other places to go that probably have food that is just as good (or better) for 1/3 of the price and don't ding you for sitting outside.
Did I mention how much you get ripped off???
I would not go here again or recommend this place to anyone.
I had lunch here with a colleague while in Madrid for work.
"One of our colleagues from Madrid recommended the restaurant, and we were not disappointed."
"Everything we had was fantastic, especially the jamon."
"I would definitely recommend eating here, but it was a bit expensive for lunch."
They didn't have a lunch menu so it was the same as dinner prices.
"fantastic food, well and simply cooked, very very big portion and good price."
I advice you to eat to Fado!!!!!!!!
!
During our stay in Fuertenentura we dined at the famed and ´raved about´Fado Rock.
What a dissapointment - the meal was disgusting - nothing had any flavour at all.
My husband selected a starter of smoked salmon - it was like eating plastic - I had the mussels - they appeared to have come out of a packet and the sauce to accompany had no taste.
On to mains - we both chose the Fado Rock mixed Grill on hot rocks - the meat all tasted the same - and the amount of grissle was laughable - I´ve had better meals in Little Chefs.
Overall we went there expecting a really good night - and left very dissapointed - I would certainly miss this one unless Gordon Ramsay visits them for a Restaurants From Hell Series.
Certainly in a town with many steak houses I would miss this out... And to add insult to injury this heap of rubbish cost us more than many other restaurants we´ve dined at.....
we have a house in caleta and we visit Fado s at least three times when we go out there.
always go early as it gets very busy.
portions are huge .
"My fave is the leg of lamb ,and that is exactly what you get A WHOLE LEG OF LAMB."
"they even bring you mint sauce.with it, give the place a try im sure you will enjoy , staff and service good too .i will say there are a number of very good restuarants in Caleta ,but i would say this probably is the best."
We have been to Fortuna a number of times and have never been disappointed.
"I understand that the restaurant has been around for over 20 years, Marion and his team are so welcoming and very friendly."
I was surprised to see there have been no previous reviews posted given that you do sometimes need to queue - generally this happens on a saturday (think ex-pats joining in the treat)  The starter menu isn't particularly extensive but there something for everyone.
There is a lot more choice on main menu and I can't recommend the lamb enough.
I think it's most peoples choice as it just mouthwatering.
There is a choice for a smaller portion but we always go for the large.
Served with either red cabbage or mixed veg plus canarian potatoes it's spot on.
I do like my fish and the fish of the day is normally sea bass - the fish comes whole and there's not much space left on your plate for anything else - it's excellent.
"I have seen a couple of people not happy as they left and cant imagine how or why, the only thing i can think is that it is not particulary big restaurant, and with only a couple of very hard work staff it may be the spinning plate syndrome."
In my mind that adds to the atmosphere in the restaurant.
We wouldnt go to tenerife now without making a point of going to Fortuna.
Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
Ps Fortuna 2 has opened about a 5min walk (if you follow the one way system from the taxi rank down the hill & turn left it's on the left) this seems to be more of a set menu and i think a bit cheaper - didnt go this time maybe next time
"Located on a typical street in Dalt Villa, la Oliva has a bit of a Greek taste."
Cuisine is mediterranean and prices are reasonable.
Service is kind and friendly.
Worth the visit but you have to book as it's generally crowded.
The best food we had while staying in Puerto de la Cruz.. We were staying in the Casablanka Appartments and for a change went up accross the main road round the sharpest turn and found the hidden gem.
Fresh food freshly cooked to your liking and it was the best I have tasted for a long time.
Small resturant best to book as we were lucky to get in and after us most were turned away.
Cannot praise this place enough fresh well cooked food takes time and is well worth the wait.
This place is correct but not magic or special.
A perfect tapas experience.
"Busy, bustling, light and airy."
Waiters scurrying bearing plates of fragrant food.
"Full of locals and tourists, all enjoying a long lunch."
About 50 varieties of tapas up on the blackboard.
"Their speciality is calamares alla romana - and I've never tasted better, fresher squid."
Other highlights were the albodingas (meatballs) and the garlic prawns.
"The beer's cold, they serve cava by the glass, and the prices are excellent."
Could not recommend more highly.
This used to be a fine restaurant but disappointing both last year and this year.
"Stale bread, average service, mediocre food."
Could be that two fine restaurants nearby (La Esentzia and Taberna Bacco) will push them into making some much needed improvements.
La Fonda is situated in Plaza de la Reina.
It looks a very nice restaurant with outside seating that is secluded from the road and street by screens.
My husband and I ate there one night whilst on holiday in Valencia I wish we hadn't bothered and had gone to the sandwich shop a few doors down.
Upon opening the menu both of us nearly fainted.
The menu looked very appetising but the prices were extortionate.
I was even contemplating running out of the restaurant or maybe pretending to faint.
Our meal which consisted of a main course with a shared dessert and one glass of wine each came to 87 Euros.
The waitress whilst very charming with excellent English pushed very hard trying to sell us absolutley everything.
The food wasn't even that good definately not worth what we paid.
I would not recommend this restaurant there are plenty others on this square especially Pepe Pica across the road.
"If you come to Mérida, you are most likely in town to see the archaeological remains."
"You're in luck, because the Despensa del Castúo is located about 50 meters from the entrance to the Museo Nacional de Arte Romano, and perhaps 50 more from the entrance to the Theater/Amphitheater complex."
"So the location is perfect, but is the food good?"
The short answer to this question is a resounding YES!
"La Despensa del Castúo offers a complete array of tapas, Spain-style, and at Spain prices."
"This means that you can expect to pay no more than 1.50 eu/tapa, and most of them are substantially less than this, especially if you opt for the sampler, which currently (October 2008) offers 6 tapas for 5 eu."
"Tapas in this part of Spain are generally pork-based (whether chorizo, jamón, lomo, salchichón, prueba de cerdo, patatera, morcilla etc."
"), but there is also a decent selection of cheeses, along with some seafood options."
"At el Castúo these are served on 3 or 4 inch bread rolls, sometimes as a sandwich with the whole roll and sometimes open-faced on just half of the roll."
"In addition, they have the very best olives in town, and like every bar, café, or restaurant, they'll give you a small dish of olives or some other munchie free with any beer or wine you order."
"Like the food, drinks here are very reasonably priced (wine for 1 eu, e.g.)."
"La Despensa del Castúo does have one drawback: it is too small for its popularity--they have 12 tables, all outside, and these are nearly always full, especially from 8pm to 11pm or so."
"There are tall tables inside for those willing to stand and eat, but table service is only offered to those sitting outside."
"Note: here, as elsewhere in Mérida, the staff are friendly and helpful, but not particularly comfortable speaking (or understanding) English."
Fantastic food.
The menu del dia at the bar is especially good value.
I tried as much as I could and everything was excellent.
This is a little gem.Position is almost opposite Wigan Pier Bar in Adeje.
Have been going to Tenerife for 10 years and it never disapoints.
A family run business serving excellant Chinese food with the service to match .
Prices are very reasonable.
Excellent food in a homey restaurant.
Run by a Danish family who are expatriated to Andalucia.
Friends have taken me there several times and the food has been consistently good.
A relaxing place with friendly service
Great restaurant!
"Excellent service...very discreet, but friendly."
The food is exceptional.
All desserts are home made and be sure to try the Blueberry Sorbet with Greek Joghurt.
"Decided to push the boat out and try this place,having been recommended it by some friends."
Classy table ware and glass's set the scene and the service was excellent.
"From the al a carte we had two starters ,including a delicious dish of roasted vegetables, two main courses and some lovely home made ice cream to finish."
"With the wine the bill came to €62,our most expensive dinner but well worth it for the fine food and service as the price was similar to what you would pay for an ordinary meal at home."
The only negative was when we paid the bill by CC it was converted to £'s without giving my husband the option of €'s-bit naughty.
In this area of Costa Del Sol- it's hard to find a place that stays true to it's roots and is authentic Spanish home-style cooking.
"Stumbling in from a rain storm, we were immediately warmly welcomed and seated in a small cosy restaurant smelling heavenly of freshly baked fish, porc simmering in tomato sauce and oversized full legsof smoked ham hanging from the ceiling."
"Having run out of their ""house wine"" a delicious bottle of regional good quality red wine was offered at the same (inexpensive) price."
"The meals were delicious and VERY generous- especially the ""Malaga"" fish platter."
"The owner was more than happy to explain that his place wasn't ""tourist type food"" but made with only the freshest, produce directly from the area."
This was evident as many locals had their meals here.
If you want to Guarantee Good Food then you need to eat here.
We have been to this Restaurant on every trip we have made to Maspalomas in the last Ten years.
We have never been let down by the service or the food and the staff are always good humoured and entertaining.
See our photos.
The choice of food is always good and well prepared with good sized portions.
"We have never had need to complain about the food , sometimes it is busy but we never had to wait for a table more than ten minutes."
We will be returning in Seven days and will proabbly eat there every other day for our two week stay.
The prices are generally lower than other similar type of restaurants.
It does look a little cheap but do not be put off....it is not and we are always impressed with the staff they employ aswell...Excellent and well done to the owners
"They seem to think themselves better, than they really are"
"Interesting for a drink, but a bit of too much decoration."
"Went here for an afternoon break, not a full meal."
We ordered grilled calamari and white wine.
"The waiter was ok, but not the most friendly in the world."
I think he did not like tourists much and was paying much more attention to his local customers.
"The calamari arrived, the portion I must say was generous enough, but they were not properly cleaned."
"There were still some of the ""plastic type"" bones in them and sandy inky residue we had to scape off before eating."
"If we go again, I think I would order the paella that looked really nice or the mixed grill."
"The calamari was tasty, but we were a little turned off by the lack of proper preparation of the dish."
"This restaurant is easy to find and provides a quaint, old timey atmosphere."
It does get a bit loud a times due to the piano player upstairs.
The food is of a gourmet quality (based on our American oppinions) and tastes EXCELLENT.
"The prices are high, but considering the quality of food, they are fair."
"We ordered water, wine, two appetizers and two entrees, no bread and our total was right around 50 Euros."
I am vegetarian and the waiter recommended the Vegetable and Parmesean Risotto - AMAZING!
"My husband has the duck with grapefruit sauce (this is a typical Catalunian dish, the sweet and sour combo) and thoroughly enjoyed it."
The service was outstanding.
"We didn't have a reservation on a Friday night and they sat us right away, however we got the impression that most made resevations."
On our last night in Sitges we visited the above restaurant for our anniversary dinner.
"Since the chef or the owner is a member of the Chaine de Rotisseurs of which I am also a member, my wife and I were looking forward to a nice dinner."
We ordered a Paella and a bottle of nice wine.
"The wine was very nice, but that was the end of our pleasant evening."
"As a professional chef and restaurant owner who has been in business for over 45 years, I notice things."
"The service was very unfriendly, the waiters did not come and pour any wine."
I got the impression that they did as a favour serving us.
"As far as the paella goes, I have never seen anything like it."
"The price was about $50.00 for two, which included -.50c worth of rice, a few mussels, 2 unpeeled shrimps and a few small pieces of some unrecognisable seafood."
I would never go back and also would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"This was supposed to be a special event for my wife and myself, instead it was a disaster."
"Since I was the one who picked the restaurant, I will have to make it up in a place that actually care's for its customers."
September 2008 We wanted a restaurant within walking distance of the Hotel Fuerte Miramar and tried various places in Marbella and hated all of those that we tried.
"Despite being almost next door the Messina, we hadn't ""seen"" it."
"So we tried it one night, we were rather tired and thought we would give it a go."
"We ate there 3 times in all, and on our last night, the Chef came out to see who this odd English couple were who kept coming back."
He shook our hand and thanked us for our obvious appreciation of his efforts.
"The food is beyond words, well, ours was, every night."
"If you want loads of it, with chips and frozen veg, then don't bother."
"But if you want out of this world mouthfuls, then please do go."
"Yes, the metal menu cases, and the water list, is a bit pretentious, but don't worry, the young women who serve are so friendly and efficient."
"Compared to the prices and quality of food that we had before, these prices are good value."
But it is the food.
It looks beautiful and tastes wonderful.
"We can say that it is probably the best we have eaten in a long time, and that certainly includes some top London restaurants."
a different restaurant with one of teh bests options of japonease food in barcelona
For a bite to eat in the evening.
Don't count calories there!
great option for a nice lunch at fair price in the raval's area
They have the best pintxo of tortilla de patatas ever!
"Rico, rico!"
"Best known in Barcelona, Galician cuisine, fantastic seafood"
Sitio inmejorable
"A modern way for a market bistro-restaurant, the food is really good."
Expensive but low quality.
The only option left for 80 people celebrations.
best indian cuisine restaurant in barcelona
Very very good.
You can eat as much as you want.
"The sushi is very tasty, but if you don't like Japanese food, there are other types of food."
Very god woks with diferent sauces.
Diferent kinds of sushi(NoHigh quality but good enought for the price) They cook it in front of you and seems higenic.
"Big place, perfect for large groups without reservation."
If u like eating Italian food... this is the answer!
XDD
good catalan food in down town area.
"decent Mexican, trendy but cosy, great margaritas"
for chocolate lovers
I loved their desserts and decoration.
"I am afraid it´s almost the only sushi place in San Sebastian, that may be the reason why it´s so expensive."
"However, it is a romantic spot for special occasions."
great place in hotel arts.
"If teh weather is good, also go for a drink at the lounge area"
Good home-made food at good prices.
There's a menu even at weekends.
Bad quality food.
Never again.
Great place to have a cocktail and not very fullfilling dinner.
Nice ambience.
Rather expensive.
Dress code.
"Great pizza with buffalo mozzarella, cooked in a stone oven."
"Very good ""lechona"" and arroz brut"
Good mexican food but you have to queue for a long time and they don't accept reservations.
Located in a posh neighbourhood.
great restaurant!!!
"and now they have their first michelin star... congratulations to jordi herrera, roger and all their team"
AMAZING RESTAURANT!!!
AND FINALLY AWARDED WITH THEIR FIRST MICHELIN STAR!!!
EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!!
!
Great food and real cheap!
Typical Spanish and the best solomillo of Salamanca!
to posh!
do not worth it..
Likhe the car on the seiling
"Historical Valencia restaurant, very good paellas and seafood."
Very nice and special place!!!
Also very good food!!
!
"Such a nice place, a little bit noisy indeed."
Traditional/creative food.
They serve coffee or a cocktails earlier or late at night.
"Tragaluz Group created different restaurants in Barcelona, each one with a different philosophy, this is one of the best."
Amazing food and good wines!
"Best ""murcilla"" in town!"
"nice atmosphere,  rather good food"
What a great restaurant..theatre and food all at once...The floor show from the Japanese Chefs was fabulous to watch...your dinner cooked in front of your eyes.
"Each individual dish beautifully prepared to our individual wants, yum."
The staff were courteous and more than helpful.
This was a real treat for our last night in La Cala.
The restaurant stood out leaps and bounds above the other local restaurants.
I recommend to all and it wont break the bank.
We have been visiting Calahonda for many years & always visit Villa Paradiso.
"Although the character of this restaurant has changed over the years & it is less exclusive now than it was, the food is still excellent with a very varied price range & menu."
The 'Specials' are usually very special if a little more expensive.
The pasta dishes are very good too.
"My wife and I recently stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a glass of wine, and ended up each having a Picasso pizza."
"We thought they were quite good, and priced reasonably compared to other area restaraunts."
We would certainly return
"small place, but what a charming, colourful and comfortable holiday!"
"recommend it to anyone that fancies a relaxing, but trendy break!"
check out the sinks in the rooms - huge.
"We ate here as a family of three in August and while the food was excellent, it was easily the most expensive meal of our holiday (91 euros, including drinks) and it wasn't the most memorable, either."
It is run by an Irish woman and her husband and I found her attitude at front of house rather stand-offish and his service rather patronising.
Worst of all was the slowness of the service all round.
We turned up at 7pm and were told we could have a table outside but it had to be free by 9pm.
"“Fine by us”, we thought as our six-year old would be restless by then anyway."
"We perused the (set) menu and knew within two minutes what we wanted, but it then took at least 20 minutes for them to take the order and the service of later courses was similarly slow, so much so that the meal stretched on and on and it was two minutes to nine before we left the table."
"We had a much more enjoyable time, for about two thirds of the price, a couple of blocks further back in the old town, at a restaurant called The Balcony of the Virgin, where the food was just as good and the service was impeccable."
Like other reviewers we were surprised to discover this in the Palau Nacional.. Great food - bargain prices - like so many great restaurants in Barcelona (or maybe I just always compare to the overly inflated prices we pay here in the UK!).
Also stunning views of Barcelona - well worth the trip and a good stop gap on your way further up Montjuic
"Beautiful steak, large portion."
Normal price.
This restaurant did not disappoint.
Food like at home!
"An old 'rustic' beach restaurant/bar, not much to look at but it's right on the beach."
You just have to try their mussels in cream sauce !
!
"A lovely wine bar, snuggled a street back from the castle in Moraira."
We go to Spanish class on a Tuesday night for 10E and a free glass of wine or a coffee.
The owners are so friendly and extremely knowledgeable about wine.
I would highly recommend that you pay them a visit.
"I am a local, so I know my restaurants and bars!"
This is one of the best!
hands down the least pretentious most amazing authentic innovative could not get enough!
and reasonable to boot  trobertthorogood@gmail.com
Very original decoration.
Food is average
Still can't believe that I'm the first person to write about this restaurant.. We have been here 3 times in the last 2 years - twice in one week back in September.
A true hidden gem in what i still the best part of town.
Great food - great wine and great service HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you can find it!!
It's just off Princessa..
Samsara is right next to the local beauty spot – the Maspalomas dunes and oasis – which is rather appropriate because the restaurant itself is an oasis of class in a desert for good eating..
"This is THE stylish restaurant, both in the food and surroundings."
The décor is oriental with lavish money spent to give real atmosphere (expect huge Buddhas and couches with endless cushions)…a place for a civilised and romantic night out.
Smart casual is the preferred dress but on the night we went some people were in shorts which is an insult for all the care which has been taken in the planning.
You can sit outside and see the lights of the surrounding hills but that can be a bit chilly.
Or you can sit in a glass enclosed area inside.
The food is superb…with a far east fusion on western dishes such as steak and duck and fish.
"There are two Juans here: the chef, who presents the food with decoration worthy of a top restaurant and the Maitre d’ who actually seems to care that you have a relaxed time."
Order one starter between two; the portions are large.
The wine list is short and reasonable.
Downsides: You can sometime wait too long for your order to be taken.
And if you have put on weight during the holiday you might have trouble squeezing through the toilet door.
"Exquisite, imaginative food served in impecable style."
The upstairs restaurant may require a reservation - the tapas bar also had excellent tidbits on show.
Very convenient while touring the Casco Viejo (Old City).
"We had a terrble meal here, cold soup- maybe they like it that way in warm countries."
Fish dry and tasteless - charmless staff.
"The Malvaysia wine was nice, but all they had to do with that was chill it"
This is the second time i have visited Lanzarote and i had to go back to my favorite restaurant on the island.
I hadent been back in 3 years and was shocked to find the place under new managment.
"To my delight the new owners have managed to keep the same classic spanish feel which most of the island seems to lack, and also improve the menu and wine selction!"
"The service is always with a smile, prompt but just the right amount a time for a glass of wine and to let your courses settle."
The food is superb!!
All fresh produce and you can taste the difference.
The prices are very good for the area and there is a good selection of wines and beers.
locals frequent this restaurant to... Says it all to me if the residents recommend it!!
Very impressed!!
and cant wait to return to this lanzarote gem!
Big thanks to Big Tony and Karen who make the experience unforgetable!
The Casa Roja occupies a unique spot overlooking the harbour in the Old Town.
The food is excellent with a distinct fish bias.
Try the Paella and the fish baked in salt.
We are not keen on the Canary potatoes but there is no problem getting alternative vegetables.
We have always eaten on the terrace and there is always something going on below either on or at the edge of the water.
The service is well above average and unhurried.
There is no pressure to leave once one has finished the meal.
Great choice of wines but we have found the house red and white as good as any.
Give it a try
Paseig de Gracia and Arago.
(El Paseo de Gracia y Aragon) The cuisine is fusion - French/Catalan.
The price is excellent.
The staff is friendly and English menus are available when asked for.
The atmosphere is casual elegant.
The fish and seafood dishes are exceptional.
"Must save some room for the desert - my favourite is called the ""Tim Boan Special""."
Arround 20 Euros for the for a 3 course dinner including a glass of house wine.
"Note that line-ups in the weekends may start as early as 8:00 pm, although the doors are open only at 8:30 for dinner."
A good place to meet old friends at the heart of Cercedilla
The shrims are delicious!!
"The place is like big, new and has little charm."
This restaurant was tipped as the best Indian Restaurant in Madrid and I wholeheartedly agree.
"Food and service were excellent, vegetarians are very well catered for and the staff are charming."
It is absolutely essential to book even out of season.
Nearest Metro station is Lista.
I was taken to this unlike spot by a local and had terrific food.
"Service was fine, if un exceptional, and everyone seemed to know my friend."
"The appetizers were great, and the Venison Steraqk was terrific"
Overall very good food.
"We shared a few appetizers such as jambon, some type of cheese (possibly manchego), and croquettes."
These were all excellent.
"My main course was bacalao, which had a sauce that was a little too heavy and dull."
A few of my companions had the steak which got very positive reviews (indeed one in our group had eaten there two nights in a row).
"The interior is warm and inviting, not too loud."
According to the outside there is a La Parra in Seville and London as well.
Situated on the edge of the beach gives this place a great setting for lunchtime or evening meals.
Try the special salad bowls at lunch with a jug of the sangria.
Evening meals display a great variety with large portions of excellent fresh ingredients.
No more expensive than any other restaurants in Corralejo.
Decent house wines - try the sangria champagne with your evening meal for a unique experience.
While staying in Corralejo we spent some time wandering around the town in search for some good places for dinner.
We always try to stick to the local places rather than tourist trap which is not an easy thing to do Corralejo beijng to great distinct tourist place.
"After leaving all the noisy places with dodgy and cheesy ""singers"" behind we came across ""El Pescador""."
"It is situated in a slightly quieter side of the harbor (bear in mind that the town is small hence distances tend to be pretty short :-)), surrounded by other similarly looking places."
After glancing through the menu and seeing many people inside (many of who were Spanish) we have decided to give it a try.
It proved to be a very good decision and we found ourselves coming back for the number of consecutive evenings.
The place serves fresh fruit de mer every day.
In fact if you are into fishing you may even go for fishing with them in the (early) morning- at an extra cost (obviously).
The service is pretty laid back (as you would expect in Spanish culture) but at the same time why would you be in the rush if you are on holidays?
The prices are reasonable (slightly below their neighbors restaurant) but the key point is that the quality of food was unrivaled when compared to other restaurants in town.
Truly recommend it- both my wife and I have enjoyed it very much.
"Definately the best restaurant on the island,run by an Irish man and his polish wife off the beaten track and you just feel like your actually 'out' for dinner fabulous food,desserts to die for great service and ambiance,would reccommend this place highly."
I went here soon after they opened earlier this year and although it was very busy I was disappointed.
The buffet food was luke warm at the best and generally tasteless.
Why cannot they fit a plate warmer?
When the food is luke warm and put on a cold plate it ends up cold.
"The whole Wok concept doesn't really do it for me, I always end up with a main dish that tastes disappointing despite following their suggestions I have subsequently been there twice more with friends who wanted to try it and each time I have left disappointed."
"I did notice that by the bar area they have tea towels laid out to dry, maybe they don't have a dishwasher for glasses but tea towels in a restaurant are hardly hygienic!"
We went here for a meal on our recent trip..Only 3 diners and us.
"We had to send the food back..reheated, microwaved chicken..yuk."
The place was freezing too.
Much nicer places to eat in Ronda
Still smarting after being ripped off in this Tapas bar last week.
My fault that I believed the waiter when he recommended the CHEAP house wine and didn't check the price.
"When the bill arrived the restaurant had stuffed it with one of the most expensive wines on their list and claimed this was their standard house wine, though now he was no longer claiming it was cheap."
"Food so so, service poor, waiters and general policy towards tourists is terrible, if you want good CHEAP tapas without the ripoffs there are several good local alternatives"
Very disappointing after Can Majo the night before.
Don't waste your time or money.
Wish I had done Can Majo again.
I ate in Botafumeiro last week.
"The restaurant is very good, maybe the style is old-fashioned."
By the way the paella was gougeous and also the polpo alla gallega.
I spent 60 € for 2 dishes plus a mini bottle of wine.
They offered me the dessert (amazing cakes) and the passito wine.
Very good service.
The food here is outstanding.
Top class restaurant.. You won't dissapointed...
I have been to Malage on numerous occasions and always go to this restaurant!
"The menu has simple foods such as salads, meat free lasagnes, veggie burgers etc but the food is amazing!"
I have not found another veggie restaurant that is in the same league.
The restaurant is simply decorated but is always busy with locals - a very good sign.
Would recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Malaga as the food quality is good and so are the prices!
i must agree this place is perhaps the best place i've ever eaten just fantastic food with wonderful staff a must for anybody who is visiting the island
We had a fabulous meal here during our recent trip to to Spain.
I would highly recommend the degustation menu.
It has just the perfect amount of food - we left very full but not stuffed.
The chef takes risk with the food however it isn't too experimental - it's just plain tasty!
One of my favourite restaurants.
"Ideal for those who like eating ""tapas vascas""!"
"It's a very touristic restaurant, aimed to get profit from the people who come to visit Baeza."
"If you see it from outside, its like a tapas bar but if you step in and tell the patrons you want to eat, they'll guide you in a inner room."
"The food is just basic, even the local specialties, and the price is ridiculously high, considering also the place and the average prices of the area."
"excellent little bar inside the malibu park complex, good range of food something for both kids and adults, all reasonable prices, owners cat and steve are very friendly, make you feel welcome."
also pool tables and ping pong which our kids loved.
most reccommened.
went to wok wok in september 2008 best food good prices all cooked in front of you we were well impressed.
Love this place.
"Atmosphere is great, good tapas, friendly staff and great locality."
A visit to BCN wouldn't be the same without a visit to Alt Heidelberg!!
Yeah
"Came here a couple of times over our time in Marid, the food is what can be expected of a Hard Rock Cafe which is of a good standard."
"Large portions, nachos are well recomended as a sharing starter."
"The highlight however is the very friendly staff, the great cocktails and the outside eating area."
A great place just to come for a drink even if your not eating.
The decor of Flamant instantly evokes a warm clubby feel with its lamps and wood trim.
Too bad the interior designer may well know more about food and service than the staff.
"All the dishes we ordered must have been ""plated"" hours if not the day before, so that either the food was too bland, too jelled, or not microwaved enough."
The leek pie was the only thing passable; the fish was dry and the stroganoff tasted like sandpaper.
"Perhaps, being there on a Sunday evening did not help as the staff must have been pulled in off the street - they had little knowledge of the food and lacked any passion."
"Also, they had a wine list of perhaps 8-10 choices, of which 3 were out."
"Avoid, avoid and avoid - spend your hard earned euros on a more authentic stablishment."
When I came to Spain we were desperately looking for some Mexican food!
We found this one and fell in love!
We go back often and the staff is SUPER sweet!
The food is really good.
Its not like in the States where you have chips and salsa--but the atmosphere is nice.
Be sure to try the Queso Fundido (appetizer) AMAZING!
and so are the tacos al pastor w/ pineapple.
really good.
Havent had any other mexican rest.
so i dont know if its the BEST--but its good and does the trick when we have a craving
"Travelling home thru' Palma airport, we decided to dine in Palma before our late night flight."
It was our first time to visit Palma city and we stumbled upon this restaurant by chance- it was one of very few open before 7pm.
We had a super meal- everyone raved about their choices and this restaurant had a high standard to maintain as we had eaten well all week.
Alex's dessert was an experience!
- my 15 year old also raves about her tuna tartare!
I could not fault this restaurant and it was a super end to a great holiday.
What a delightful local restaurant!
"Our precruise group of 18 cruise critic folks wanted a ""fun"" place to get together for dinner and meet for the first time before boarding our Transatlantic cruise ship."
This certainly met our requirements.
Not a fancy tourist restaurant but a very casual local tavern and restaurant.
We spent an hour enjoying the FREE wine from 4 kegs in the foyer then went in to dinner for a great meal.
"Even though the servers did not speak much English we had a great time communicating in broken Spanish, French and sign language."
We would definitely recommend Taverna cam Margarit for anyone looking for something different.
We did some research before out stay in Alicante and saw Darsena recommended on a number of occassions.
Our hotel too said it was one of the best restaurants in Alicante so we arrived with high expectatons.
The views over the harbour were great so things were on course.
It was downhil though from the moment we walked in.
"Service without a smile, brusk and ill mannered, slamming plates down and no eye contact."
.Everything seemed too much trouble.
(Maybe its because we are not Spanish which most of the clientel seemed to be - or was it just snobbery?)
.
'Pythonesque' was a description that sprang to mind .
"As for the food, the most boring salad ( underessed) was followed by the 'house speciality' Lobster with rice."
Honestly - for 32 euros each for the main course we had to play hunt the crustacean!
We found ourseves poking around our plates to find tiny morsels .
"The rice, which tasted like it had been made using OXO cubes, was gloopy and bland."
"As for the sweets , they were clearly not made to order and were sickly sweet ,dry offerings that just didnt match the price tag."
"The worst was he waiter at the end who, on suspecting we might be reluctant to leave a tip ( we had left much of our food) hovered around trying ot embarass us into making a contribution."
The wine was OK and luckily my wife and I have a sense of humour and had a great evening privately laughing at the Fawlty Towers service and grotty food.
Dont go there!
!
pleasant enough bistro food but 80 euros for two courses was a lot for what it was- nice atmosphere and pleasant waiters
"On a recent stay at the Kempinski Hotel, we took a taxi into Estepona to have a dinner and see the port."
"Having read a glowing report on Tripadvisor about Rosatti, and not knowing the town well, we decided to try Rosatti."
Despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty we found our initial welcome to be less than warm.
"We were given menus but not asked if we wanted a drink and eventually had to call the waitress to take our order, The starter was just average but the main course was one of the worst we have had anywhere in Spain."
My main course of pork was dangerously undercooked and the saute potatoes were oozing with the taste of old cheap oil.
My husband's veal was tough and swimming in grease.
It was quiet evident that there was a problem as we both pushed our plates away after two bites.
The 2 full plates of food were taken away without question or comment.
"It was quiet clear that neither of us had enjoyed our food, of which the staff were fully aware, but they only seemed interested in taking a not inconsiderable sum of money from us."
Their attitude was so poor that we didn't feel we would get anywhere by complaining.
We will steer well clear of Rosatti on future trips and advise others to do the same.
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Set Portes!
"We went very early by Barcelona standards (7:30pm) and there was no wait, but there was a line when we left."
"The paella wasn't spectacular, but the other entrees for our group were very nice."
The first courses were all terrific - we almost went back another night just to dine on the starters.
"The ambience is lovely, and the waiters are worth the trip!"
Have been to this restaurant many times over the years and thanks to Israel and his staff we have always had an excellent meal.
Service is superb and everybody is friendly.
Can recommend the game dishes when in season.
"I'm new to Fuengirola, and today I used the web to look for a good restaurant."
I found Don Pe.
"The place gives a very good impression, nice and clean."
Friendly staff.
"Out of 7 meals, 3 were very good, 1 acceptable, 2 poor, and 1 lousy."
"The duck tasted like it died last year, the rice was next to uncooked, and the asian dish was left untouched after the first bite."
Not a place I will return to.
My wife and I have been going to Rufino for many years.
Quite simply it can't be faulted.
"Location, service, ambience and food all get 5*****."
We will be there again on 9th November 2008 and can't wait to savour once again their wonderful shoulder of lamb!!
Sue & Peter Greeson Holyport Berkshire UK
"Walking into this place sets you up to expect bland fast food, but the food is actually quite tasty and inventive."
"It's all vegetarian, with a lot of options for vegans and celiacs (gluten allergy)."
The mint yogurt drink is a must!
Portions are large.
"The breaded jalapeno peppers, and the avocado salad were really good."
The vegetarian paella was a little bland.
Restaurante La Mezquida is the place to go to avoid the tourists (the waiters do not speak English) & eat typical Spanish cuisine.
"They have a full range of rice dishes, fidues (noodle dishes) together with beautiful lamb chops & fish."
It is an un-pretentious Spanish restaurant serving authentic Spanish cuisine.
As it is mainly frequented by Spanish guests it is better to eat late here (10:00 or later) if you want to savour the atmosphere.
Although it is not in the prettiest of locations the terrace at Sunday lunchtime (2:30 onwards) or on a warm evening is really atmospheric.
The good news is that they have yet to discover tourist prices.
"If you want to stay at home but and eat one of the best paellas that you can find, then why not try La Mezquida?"
They do “paella para llevar” (to take away).
Enjoy!
A very popular (and noisy) restaurant
"The food and service in this restaurant are excellent, The Paella is the best in Benidorm, The breakfast's are great and reasonably priced with an extensive menu from morning till late, the location is fantastic with views of Levante Beach and fantastic sunsets over the mediterranean from October through to January, summer months open til very late and about 8pm in winter"
I went to this restaurant because the hotel recommended it.
"The menu seemed to be OK, but the troubles started when my husband ordered the wine: we had to order three different ones until finally we asked the waiter to bring ""whatever they had"", since they didn´t have the ones we liked."
We ordered the food and the starters were nothing out of this world.
"The main dish was the worst problem, because they brought my husband´s meat (sirloin steak, rare), but not mine (grilled sole with vegetables)."
My husband said we both wanted to eat together and so he said we wanted both dishes at the same time.
"When they finally arrived, the fish was burnt outside and quite raw inside, while my husband´s meat was overcooked."
We told this to the waiter who told us it was our fault because the meat had to be reheated while waiting for my fish.
"My husband said he didn´t like the meat that way and asked for another, which arrived... 20 minutes later!!!"
"After that, we decided to skip dessert and have an icecream somewhere else."
They didn´t even apologize for all the inconveniences we had suffered.
"Yes, this is a touristy restaurant but with a history dating back many years it is not surprising, it is not gimmicky as the photos from its past clearly show, it has hardly changed."
"Yes, it's not cheap but the food - even on a Monday - was very good."
"The atmosphere, ambience, service were all excellent!"
"We had booked a table, which is a good idea, and were seated near to the open plan kitchen and could actually watch the chefs - unusual and interesting (for anyone who likes to cook anyway)."
It didn't detract from the atmosphere not being in one of their 'main rooms' - in fact it was rather fun being in the thick of things!
"And, even though there were a lot of tourists, there were some Spanish people too."
Definitely worth a visit.
We organized a dinner in Mestizo very recently.
We were two tables of 14 people.
"We organized with the owner/manager a fixed menu for 25 euros, including two dishes, one complimentary margarita and cafe."
"The margarita was closer to water than anything else but, you know, this can happen also in the best places."
"What has been very bad is that the manager charged us three additional menus, never ordered/eaten by anybody (we were 28 and not 31 as he claimed, crazy) and with a very unpolite behaviour pretended (let me say with a metaphora ""robbed"") the money we didn't have to really pay."
"After half-an-hour discussion, we've been forced to pay (I mean, what else you can do if the police doesn't come to the place?)"
"and, by the way, he didn't issue any check in paper...just got the money, no taxes paid on that bill."
Do you have questions on the food?
Whatever you can buy frozen in a supermarket and then cook poorly at home would be better.
"Believe me, madrid is such a beautiful city and Mestizo - if I can give you an advice - is not a place to visit."
"Ca'n Punyetes is in C/ Barques, a small street running parallel to the seafront."
Walk up Cala Mariners opposite the taxi rank and turn right into Carrer Barques.
Authentic Spanish food.
"Try the tapas, especially the green peppers."
Any of the main course fish dishes can be recommended but we particularly like the monkfish.
We have been visiting Alcudia for years and eat here at least once on every visit.
"The food is always good and excellent value, served by the same friendly staff year after year."
It must be good because the locals use it.
"Fancy decoration in the heart of Chueca, but very bad service and too expensive for the mediocre food."
"We had been there twice, and we cannot stop praising this restaurant."
The food is aboslutely delicious.
"My husband had the Crepe de Morcilla (black pudding crepe), and he says is the most delicious thing he has tried."
"I order the Entrecote, and you could literally cut the entrecote with the fork!!!"
"the quality of the food is outstanding, but most of all, is the owner himself and the restaurant's staff that makes the place very lively."
10 points out of 5!!
!
"We are ""foodies"" and very hard to please."
La Escalera was just plain terrific in every way.
We were in Spain for 12 days with another couple.
"We ate in Barcelona, Madrid, Granda, Ronda, etc."
and this was the best food and experience we had.
We went twice!
"Not only was the food great, the restaurant was authentic and FUN!"
"Grandma's Pork was absolutely fabulous, with wonderful rich flavor."
Lamb was also delicious.
The waiters and owners were full of fun and put little side skits on while you eat.
If you go on the weekends you will have the pleasure of listening to Nicola Giovanni - an Italian guitarist and singer - wonderfully talented and also full of fun.
"If you want great, home-cooked, food, friendly service, and some laughs, don't miss La Escalera."
"Note - Park as you enter the town, it is much easier than navigating the very narrow roads."
ENJOY!
Good pizzas
We are not normally driven to write reviews but I didn't want another unsuspecting family group to have the same experience as we did.
We were a group of two families booking through Mallorca Farmhouses.
"The villa was in the 'essential' collection, on booking we asked why this villa was considered to be within this category, answers varied from 'distance from beach' to 'well we often don't know how to categorise villas and some have to be in the essential category'."
The photos and description seemed excellent which is why we asked the question before booking.
"Once we arrived we had a quick look around and couldn't find the 5th bedroom - oh that's because it's hidden behind the utility room, smells awful and damp - quite claustrophobic."
"Went to kitchen to make a cup of tea to find all cutlery needed a wash and was in the main rusty, kitchen sink filthy dirty, floors throughout hadn't been mopped and our feet were black within minute."
Hair and dirt in shower - never heard of bleach obviously!
"Beds hard as nails, one small towel each which was threadbare, pool lights not on at night, garden furniture thrown around pool area, lights and some sockets not working, advertised as having air conditioning in all bedrooms, one small old electric fan was in evidence instead!"
"TV in bedroom not working and only half a screen working in lounge, dishwasher needing a full service as all crockery and glasses were 'white' when we arrived."
Washing machine broken and leaking.
Large gas oven and hob very dangerous and not useable - sign on it saying cannot use grill!
Only positive about this poor old neglected villa was the large American fridge!
"When the rep arrived the following day we read our list of complaints, she was obviously untrained in customer service as just kept making excuses and speaking over us when we were explaining the problems we had experienced."
"The following two weeks were a nightmare as one maintenance man after another visited the property, took away TV's but not replaced, turned on pool lights, left additional towels only to take them away again the next day!"
We couldn't wait to get home.
What an absolute waste of money - our two complaint letters were replied to but were full of excuses and false justifications.
We did receive £250 refund because of the false claim to have air conditioning but this was not proportionate bearing in mind the cost of the villa was in the region of £6000!!!!
"The area is beautiful though and the sandy cove at Cala Sanau is stunning, just avoid booking through Mallorca Farmhouses!"
!
Simple but excellent seafood with no frills.
Had eaten in the highly rated Lhardy the prevous evening and paid more than twice as much per head for lesser food.
Service is efficient but friendly.
Its two months since I ate here - could not remember the name of the restaurant but recently found it - and cannot remember the exact dishes but the highlight was a medley of seafood served on a tiered display that was replenished twice.
FIve of our party of six shared thisand the other had an excellent sole.
For starters the tuna and sweet peppers was excellent.
Highly recommended and not sore on the pocket.
We visited Zozoi on a very wet evening in Oct.
The staff were welcoming and friendly.
Service was pleasant and not too formal.
The food was excellent- tasty and very generous portions.
Main dishes were served with delicious vegetables.
We had fillet steak and the rack of lamb .Overall we thought it was by far the best we'd experienced in Marabella in this price range.
Not to be missed I'd say .
"Excellent, tasty, well prepared and presented food."
...and they are open all day.
Salad consisted of mango and arugula with grilled goat cheese and roasted peppers.
Wow!!!
it was the highlight.
My wife had a grille artichoke that was to die for.
"Fresh, crispy, perfectly cooked."
"For the entree, I had a Turban of sea-bass and courgette with light sauce of yogurt."
You can't imagine the presentation.
"My wife had a Moroccan ""surpirse"" pastilla, that consisted on chicken in a wrap."
Dessert was an Orange blossom sorbet with mint and ice tea orange.
Yummy.
Great views of the Alhambra.
"Overall a great find, a wonderful restaurant."
The best steaks in Playa del Ingles
"When we were in Sergovia for the day, we went around the town and found either the prices of the restaurants were expensive or the menu were not really that inspiring (you know, the usual main course which is usually a fried piece of meat and some soggy chips)."
"Then, we came just by accident , onto the RESTAURANT NARIZOTA (check it on www.narizotas.net)."
"It has a menu del dia which offers 5-star restaurant type selections for about $15, so it is a real steal !."
(A la carte dishes are substantially more expensive though.
)The portions were not large but they were ample.
The restaurant was also very tastefully decorated and clean without being garish.
"The restaurant also accepts credit cards and the waiters were very, very attentive and pleasant.."
"There were not many , if any tourists eating there except us, and most others were locals.We feel we MUST inform other members of TripAdvisor about this incredible find....unfortunately, we do not know how to add this restaurant name to the Sergovia restaurant list."
So we had to piggyback it on the comments for this Meson de Candido restaurant.
I was in Kabuki Wellington this mounth (Novenber 2008)and i had a really bad experience.
"If you going to a Japonese Restaurant you expect fresh fish, perfect and traditional cuts on vegetables and fish f.e., traditional dishes traditionally made (and not creations),..."
"The restaurants is very good looking and very fashion, but my disappointment with the food brings this critic voice."
"I can't eat something that they name Usuzukuri (Thinly sliced fish) and they bring pieces of fish, not thin at all, and everything that they add with it, was so strong in flavour that you didn't feel any fish at all."
"f.e.. Nigiri with the fish dried on the edges, showing that the fish wasn't fresh at all."
"Tuna Teriyaki, even over cooked the fish had smell and flavour of not being fresh :( (Very Bad) Age mono in the Kabuki Salad too fried no flavour."
"Tuna Tartare with 2 or 3 pieces of rice that i don't know were they came from, but not from the tartare i suppose."
No Uramaki on the Classic or Kabuki Menu.
"To many truffle in everything, cuts all flavour of fish, they want to cover the freshness of the fish???"
In Sushi Bar you can't see them working or see the fish.
What is churros with chocolate in Japan??
?Do they have this Desato.???
"Took 30 minutes from Tempura to main course, 20 minutes dessert, 20 minutes to coffee, and not at any moment someone asked us if was everything ok!!"
Very Strange for the best Japonese in Town.
Is Madrid that small or the cooking is just as bad as this one???
Or probably to expensive for the people that know what is what to go and eat there.
Wont go Back.

"On the 23rd of November i wet to the kabuki Wellington, and i must say that was one of my worst experiences in Japanese cuisine."
"Everything was bad,the was not fresh,the cuts was not perfect at all,sukiyaki really bad made and without white rice,truffle in everything taste to it."
"Desserts was really estrange and take to long to came to the table,and we stay there for almost 3 hours and nobody asks if was everything ok."
"The restaurant was very nice very fashion,and china very beautiful, but all the rest very bad."
NEVER AGAIN.

"My personal review from Foster's Hollywood, the one closest to expo hotel."
"We were the first people in the restaurant that night, and it took about 5 mins for us just to find a waiter and then to be sitted."
"After that, they took our order quite fast, but then the good things stopped."
45 mins from we sat down to our food was served.
Thats not acceptable when there were only 3 people (us) in the restaurant.
"When the food was served, all of our 3 beef's were cold, raw and tasted old."
Sideorders where cold to.
"50 mins did we spend in the restaurant, and we leaved without eating or paying."
"Terrible place, DONT eat there."
The restaurant is in the Marina at Moraira.
"So no roads or traffic to contend with, just sit back and enjoy the surroundings."
"They only run their lunch menu Monday to Friday, so if you want the benefit of that plan accordingly (I think that is 20€ during the week)."
At the weekend it is all a la carte.
The food it top quality.
"I had a well cooked calimar as a starter, followed by Arroz con gambas and a hot chocolate souffle to round it all off."
"All in an unhurried atmosphere, watching the world go by in the marina."
It is certainly a lot cheaper than the Dauphin (owned by the same chap) but perhaps a shade more expensive than most Moraira restaurants.
"My conclusion is that it offers good food, well cooked and in pleasant surroundings."
"All in all, though not cheap, offers great value for money"
Sit in the soft glow of the deep red light and enjoy cocktails mixed by real experts.
Still the best Mojitos we have ever tasted.
Cava cocktails are a little less expensive.
"If you want to enjoy a bar that feels authentically different to anything you have ever experienced at home, this is one not to miss."
I have an apartment in Villaricos and have now eaten 3 times at this restaurant.
"It is always very full at lunchtime and with locals, which says a lot."
"On just about every occasion we have been the only English people, which we like, but may intimidate others."
It helps to be able to get by in Spanish.
I would recommend booking a table for lunch.
There is a wonderful set lunch for about 18 euros which includes a very drinkable bottle of Rioja.
"There is a choice of about 3/4 per course, but the paella starter is always good and the bread with garlic butter spread is to die for."
This is a good authentic Spanish dining experience
We stummbled upon this tapas bar after a long day of sighseeing.
"We just wanted a little bite to eat, some beer, some sangria.... More then we could have ever hoped for."
"We visited this tapas bar 3 more times before we left BCN, each time bringing a new friend with us so they could experience the delight."
"The tapas is so fresh, i highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch them prepare your food."
"It seemed to have an emphasis on seafood, so don't leave without trying the cuttlefish!!"
Everything was amazing...you can't go wrong here.
The selection of beer is good...i mostly drank sangria here though.
Don't go to Barcelona and miss this place.
You'll be sad you did.
"As far as having to wait, as long as you are there on a weekday or during the day, you should have no problem."
"If you do have to wait, its worth it."
Went to the India Gate for a meal during our last stay in Benidorm October 2008.
"Have to say that neither my husband or myself are great fans of Indian food, we enjoy it three or four times a year and that's enough."
"However, the India Gate was absolutely excellent."
"The service was second to none, and the food was absolutely beautiful - on a par with the local up market Indian Restaurant which usually costs us around £60 for a meal for two of us with a couple of drinks."
"We had poppadoms with assorted chutneys, a starter each, and a main course each."
The bill with drinks came to 43 euros.
"I can highly recommend the India Gate, we'll be dining there again on our next visit to Benidorm without a doubt."
"Having sat down 6 people, we were greeted by the friendly staff and chatting away."
"When the food came, consisting of 5 different dishes we were all quiet until the very last bite was consumed!"
"No time for words, only sighs and smiling in between chewing!"
"I had the goat cheese with pork filet and I have never tasted something so good, coming from pork!"
"The setting was really nice, very standard Ibiza style, nothing spectacular but placed in the heart of D´alt Vila makes it a perfect spot to sit and suck up the atmosphere of Ibiza town by night before heading off to the super clubs."
"Mamabels should be accoladed as one of the most special places to stay - firstly, the location - superb mountain and sea views - then the rooms - all indiviaually decorated and tastefully furnished with antique furniture and original paintings - all of course enjoying superb views."
Our room had a terrace which was a wonderful place to sit and and chill.
Breakfast is served on the terrace and is simply magical!
"Superb fresh bakery produce, wonderful coffee and freshly squessed juices - we even had freshly squeezed melon with grape!"
The best part of Mamabels however are the family themselves - Mamabel is a wonderful character and a superb cook!!
"Carlos, her son, is very friendly and informative of the area and his wife, Mar who greets us at Breakfast is equally friendly - we alsmost felt part of the family."
"If you want superb service, wonderful food in a wonderful environment, Mamabels is the placve to go - a very special place!!"
!
Recently returned from Nerja (Nov. 08) - we tried the Flamenco evening at El Colonio.
Not cheap - 36 euro's a head (2 adults plus 2 teenagers) plus drinks for a three course meal with entertainment.
"Excellent evening, food was very good as was the entertainment - dancers and spanish guitarist."
The restaurant is now owned by a chap from Edinburgh and his spanish wife.
He explained that El Colonio has a long standing reputation (30 years plus) of Flamenco and that they try to keep the tradition alive by employing professionals.
"Even in November the place was nearly full, including a lot of locals."
V Ryan Wilts
"Although this restaurant is in the main tourist area, it is used by locals and tourists alike."
The outside looks on to the Santa Llucia cathedral.
"The tapa on the bar is great, but if you want a better experience go downstairs."
All the tapas are set out and you just help yourself and save the sticks.
"We found that it was about 1.30pm before the hot tapas came out, try the prawns they are fabulous."
"As we were a group of Japanese tourists with very little Spanish speaking skills, we thought this pinxtos buffet-style restaurant will be perfect for us."
"Nonetheless, the restaurant was very trendy, and of course very easy to order."
You just walk up to the pinxtos buffet table with your plate and pick whatever you want to eat.
All were very tasty and delicious!
I wish they had this type of restaurant in the States!
"Excellent value, nice surroundings and staff, 7 Euro wine very nice, 6.50 Paella etc, food OK but basic - you get what you pay for."
As long as you are not expecting gourmet its great.
You can pay much more for much less.
You won't be disappointed unless you want to pay big money !
"Would defintely go back on an ""average"" nite and look for something better for a ""special"""
There is a read why people line up outside.
"The food is really good, authentic and CHEAP."
A mix paellel is only 7 euro a person!
The tortilla is 3.50 euro.
Try a lot of the starters.
"The tortilla, fish soup are extremely good."
Must get the mix paella.
The entrees are not as impressive.
We tried a fish stew and the rabbit.
I liked the paella better.
Try the cream catalan.
It's only 3 euros.
"After a walk by the sea, we went to this restaurant for lunch."
We picked this one as it was absolutely jam packed whilst the others along the promenade were nearly empty.
We were given an English menu.
"At the front of the restaurant, there was a set menu in Spanish."
"We had to ask the waiter to provide this, and he brought along another waiter to translate for us."
"I couldn't believe how cheap it was, only 8 Euros for five courses with unlimited drinks."
I was convinced that there was a trick I was missing somewhere but the waiter assured me this was correct.
"I had potatoe soup, cheese salad, steak and chips, creme brulee and cakes and tea."
Service was excellent and the food was very tasty.
I wish I had found this place at the beginning of my trip.
"The best mexican restaurant in Barcelona, i really like your burritos, specially seasoned pork & chiken."
"I ALSO LIKE THE COKTAILS, AND THE PLACE IS VERY NICE."
I´M GOING SOOOOONNNN
"We stayed at the Miramar Hotel, which is fabulous, but rather unexciting food-wise."
"The restaurant service is excellent, and the set menu and a la carte offerings are very good, but not exceptional, and consequently an average of around €12 - €19 per main course feels over-priced."
The alternatives around the town seemed geared to the family holiday trade.
"So it was with real surprise that we discovered Maxim on our last evening, and we wished we had found it sooner."
The restaurant is in the main square alongside others.
"It has a modern, fresh interior and the large plate glass front gives it an open feel."
"The meal included a fantastic Mejillon Mariner (Mussels) for €8.50, calves' liver €14.50 and pork chops €15.50."
They served a wonderful creme brule for €5.
A half bottle of quite good Cune Rioja was €8.50 and a half bottle of Monopole Chardonnay €6.75.
(The availability of half bottles is great when dining as three people with different tastes.)
Total for three people before tax: €98.75.
"Not cheaper than the hotel, but superior."
"Courses arrived in good time and service was friendly, efficient and attentive."
The atmosphere at 9.00 p.m. was sociable and vibrant.
"For me, this has to be the best restaurant in the town."
"If you stay in a hotel on the sea-front, make a point of walking in to the square."
This is a delightful restaurant with excellent food and very efficient and friendly staff.
The menu of the day at 17 euros is really good and great value.
Do visit if you are staying nearby
The food was to die for- best meal we've ever had in Spain.
I had filet mignon wrapped in pastry served in a fois gras sauce.
My husband had a local fish dish recommended by our hostess.
"The place is upstairs over a store, there aren't more than 6 tables, and you get the feeling that the couple that runs the place live upstairs."
"Seems like a mom and pop place, where mom takes care of the customers and pop runs the kitchen."
"She was hilarious, and made us feel like we were family sitting at her own dining table."
"Our hotel in Seville recommended dinner at El Colmaito de Cai because the owner of this restaurant, Vincente Ortega, is a very good host who is also, for our benefit, conversational in English."
"What we found was a charming restaurant, typically Spanish, with excellent food and beverage."
"VIncente, his mother, and our waiter, Manuel, made my wife and I feel as if we were home for the holidays."
"This restuarant was a 'five star find' not only for the fine food and excellent service, but also for the hospitality, conversation, and friendship which made our evening in Seville remarkable as well as memorable."
We even returned for coffee and conversation the next afternoon prior to leaving Seville.
"We will definitely return to El Colmaito de Cai, and will recommend this restaurant to family and friends traveling to Seville."
Went for my birthday July 2008.
I can't remember the food because the service was so poor.
"You know the sort of thing, no menus for ages & when they finally arrived I was told the delay was due to all the menus being in use."
They were obviously understaffed & in such circumstances should have refused our booking which was for 4 adults and 3 teenagers.
The kids got so bored they went to play on the beach.
The service remained dreadful from then on.
When the food did eventually come we'd all lost interest.
The food was expensive by Port de Soller standards.
"There are plenty of far superior restaurants in the area, I've been to most of them."
"Maybe I was unlucky, but if you're on a shortish break, try the others first."
We had three excellent meals at this restaurant during a week's stay in Benidorm.
"It is prominently located right on Levante beach front close to the town centre and the menu offers something for everyone, which is what attracted us to it in the first place."
"My wife and I were looking for seafood paella, which turned out to be excellent, while our six-year-old daughter wanted a pizza."
"We chose it as the location for our meal on our final night and after going straight onto wine on our previous two visits, we decided to start with two fino sherries, but the waiter had never heard of sherry ... in Spain!"
"He suggested Campari or Martini as alternatives, so maybe it is run by recently-arrived Italians who have inherited great Spanish cooks in the kitchen."
"That was the only blot on a great experience, but left us totally perplexed."
"All rather surreal, but let that take nothing away from the food, wine list, service and value for money, which are all highly recommended."
Although not strictly speaking in santa Eularia but in nearby Siesta this is worth seeking out.
The staff try hard to please and there is a wide range of dishes including excellent fish.
About average pricewise with nice ambience and some nights[ usually saturday] there is live music.
unique combinations of Mediterranean ingredients accompanied by a comprehensive and daring wine list.
"Very expensive, but is worth checking out."
"Touted as the best flamenco show in Madrid, and visited by numerous celebrities, this flamenco show was high on our list of places to visit in Spain last May."
"We requested reservations for four for a midnight show by internet through the company's on-line reservation service, 23hours before the performance, and left a credit card number."
"However we did not receive a confirmation e-mail or phone call, even as late as 5 PM the next day--the day of the show."
"We made 3 calls to the ticket office that day but were told that if we had not yet received an e-mail confirmation or booking number, there was no reservation."
"We therefore made other plans for the evening, but were appalled to find the confirmatory e-mail the next day (sent at 5:38 PM, the afternoon of the show.)"
"Sure enough, my credit card was charged for 128 euros ($198.09) for a show we never attended."
Multiple phone calls and e-mails to the company requesting a refund were denied.
"My credit card company disputed the charge but eventually paid the bill, since we did not adhere to the flamenco company's 24 hour cancellation policy (kind of hard to comply when we were not advised of the reservation in a timely manner, plus we would have been thrilled to attend had we been aware of the reservation!)"
"So, the reservation agent's laziness (thank you, Patricia Ledo) was not acknowledged as the real problem in our ""miscommunication."""
And there was no language barrier since the transaction was handled by my daughter who was living in Madrid at the time and very fluent in Spanish.
"Maybe it's a great show, but don't make last-minute reservations on the Internet, and beware of the siesta mentality!"
"What a fantastic bar and restaurant always a friendly welcome, having known the family for many years its always a pleasure to visit there especially for breakfast which is without a doubt the best breakfast in Benidorm.We will be back again next year my 30th anniversary of holidaying there.If the familly from the Robin Hood happen to read this review our love to you all Jeff & Pete xx"
"Excellent Thai food done by distinguished Issan chefs, biweekly direct import of fresh Thai vegetable not available in Spain, unpretentiuos modern interior, not much of folklore and Asian talmi,"
Have been there several times and I can say that it's a good place for listening live salsa.
Unfortunatly the Mojito was awful even if the stuff was cuban.
It's worth to be there during weekends.
Friendly small restaurant.
Have eaten there numerous times and always good service.
Fairly typical (westernised) indian menu although not quite as hot as dishes served in UK.
Well worth a visit eg if enroute to Sagrada Familia from the centre of town.
"I had turkey soup which was average, pork fillet in mustard sauce that was great, and finishing with a above average tiramisu."
Priced fairly.
"However it was the Spanish atmosphere, interior, the two guitarists, the guy who went around and poured snaps to everyone, and the excellent service that will make me go back."
wow the best i have ever tasted i would recomend to everyone and its very cheep and delicious
"My husband and I recently visited Madrid, Spain and ventured into the Retrobar near La Latina."
"The place was filthy, with garbage and cigarettes strewn all over the floor (this should have been a sign!"
"), the service was terrible (we were told that the kitchen was closing so we ordered quickly and right when the food came, the server pulled down the iron shade over the window we were sitting right in front of - there were plenty of other people in the bar as well), the food was awful and the whole experience was not something that anyone would appreciate when going out to a late-night dinner."
We will not be back.
"We'd been recommended this restaurant by a friend, and decided to give it a try."
"We'd spend a fortune on food and drink in Barcelona, so this was a real gem to find."
"We only qued for about 20 minutes, and were served quickly."
The menu was very good.
"When we saw the prices we thought the portions would be small or subquality, but the food was fantastic, well presented, and a much higher standard than some of the other places and a fraction of the price."
The house red was very good - again a fraction of the price of other restaurants.
It did not seem like a conveyor belt as some others had suggested.
Would defently eat there again
"Much better than all but one of our other tries, so went 3 times in a week!"
Many English speaking tourists in evening but mostly Spanish at lunchtime.
Some main course choices better than others.
"Can recommend the fish, and the soup is superb!"
Had seen people waiting to get in here several times and finally decided to give it a go.
"Place is clean and tidy, staff were very pleasant...food was fine."
It's not the finest cuisine in Barcelona...possibly not the finest cuisine in the square but for the price you can not argue.
It has got to be better than the paella and sangria bars on the ramblas.
"Yes, you will have to queue and yes, this is not gourmet cuisine but you will not be disappointed if you come here."
The queues are for a reason as this is probably the best value we found on our visit to Barcelona.
We went late on a busy Saturday night and waited about 40 minutes before being seated.
Service was friendly and efficient without being rushed.
We felt some of the starters were really good but the main courses were very standardised.
The wine was particularly good value.
The whole place had a busy bustling and friendly atmosphere.
We had intended to return the following night but on arrival we were told that many of the dishes were sold out and not to queue if we weren't happy with the limited choice left.
A thoughtful touch.
Best Indian food I have ever eaten!
My fiance and I actually went back a second time on the last night of our holiday since we loved the food so much the first time.
"The restaurant does serve both Indian and Italian, however we both loved the Indian food so much, we have yet to try the Italian food."
I had the vegetable curry one night and a different vegetarian dish the second night and can not pick which one i like better because they both were amazing.
"For those who can't handle spicy Indian food, you can order your food anywhere from mild, to medium to spicy to extra spicy."
The staff was very friendly and recognized us when we came back a second time and even remembered my fiance's name!
"The prices are very reasonable too....each of my veggie dishes were 6 euros and I think with an appetizer, bottle of wine, two dishes and sharing a plate of rice our bill came to only 32 euros!"
I highly recommend this place!
"Getting into Salamanca by bus one morning, we passed by this inconspicuous restaurant which seemed to have an interesting menu."
"A while later, when we got hungry we remembered the place and after some deliberation decided to walk back to Gran Via and check it out."
A very wise decision!
Staying at the bar in the entrance area we never actually ordered a 'real meal' but happily sampled some of the best tapas we've had in quite a while.
Especially interesting were the 'mini dishes' - small rations of food with somewhat more elaboration than usual tapas.
"The quality of the ingredients and the elaboration were simply excellent for the most part, even for some of the 'cheap' dishes."
There was also a rather interesting selection of wines by the glass served at very reasonable prices.
"In general the price/quality relation was excellent, at least for someone used to Madrid pricing."
All this together with a really pleasant service of the staff made for a very enjoyable experience.
"We love the Banana Garden, last year we went there about 3 times, this year we kept it to once."
There is plenty to choose from the food is good and the atmosphere when busy is great.
The entertainment can be a bit lame but all round I love this restaurant.
"Im giving it 5* not because it is a 5* restaurant but because it is what it is, for a middle of the road restaurant its great."
I took my wife to The Stay for our anniversary and enjoyed the meal so much we returned on two further occasions .We found the service to be excellent as was the food.
I particularly enjoyed the fish dishes I tried.
"The set menu was limited, as is usual, but there was sufficient variety for a number of visits."
The cost was above average but value for money.
"This is a lovely little restraunt in Javea, Alicante, Spain."
The service was great and food was lovely.
Got to be the best restraunt in town!
As newcomers to Javea we have been on the look-out for a good restaurant where we could take visiting family and friends.
Sophia's was recently suggested to us by another English couple who are living in Javea and we were delighted with our experience there.
Situated between the Javea Port and Javea Old Town its not a difficult place to find.
"Once seated & presented with the menu we splashed out on Champagne cocktails, which were delicious."
The thoughtful lighting & subtle background music added to the relaxing atmosphere making us feel very comfortable almost at once.
The service was excellent and very attentive.
"As a result, we were optimistic about the food –and we were not disappointed."
"It was exceptional, both for quality and price."
Sophia's menu although not very large had plenty of choice.
We would not hesitate to pass on our recommendation of this restaurant for any occasion and we will certainly be going back again very soon.
Look!
It's a good restaurant....yes!
"The snail is a tipc food of spain.. Name i s ""caracol""..Definitly Reccomend, for you pay 30 euro.."
El Mirador is an excellent Andalusian restaurant just down the street from the Hotel Hesperia Cordoba.
"We dined on a massive house mixed green salad, shrimp tortillitas (thin fritters), veal steak, and duck confit with blueberries."
All were excellent and portions were massive.
"Washed down with a bottle of Marque de Caceres wine and a bottle of mineral water, the total was 71 Euros."
A good choice if you want to dine on the other side of the river.
You need to know a little Spanish to parse the menu and order.
We didn't check the waiter's knowledge of English.
We had a great lunch there.
3-course meal for only 25 euros.
Beverages are reasonably priced.
"Service was good and attentive, food portion was good, very tasty and well presented."
I am on a gluten-free diet and the chef was able to accomodate me - I even got my own GF fresh baked bread.
All in all we were very happy with the food and service and would highly recommmend it.
I'm finally getting around to writing this after our last trip in September..
"I cannot believe that people have had a disappointing experience at Moo - we went this year and last year on holiday and without a doubt, one of the best meals I've ever had in my life."
"Extremely good value if you go for one of the tasting menus with matching wine... Not so sure about the cocktail bar though - very average, not very cool and definitely past it's best but the restaurant is DEFINITELY worth a visit when you're next in Barcelona.."
Do not be put off by the Cafe-like appearance of this establishment.This photograph was taken mid-morning as the customers tucked in to their breakfasts.
In the evening this retaurant is turned into a cosmopolitan wonder and it is by shear luck that tables are available for a dining experience not to be forgotten.
"All the steak dishes are freshly cooked at your table together with the accompanied sauces.I would suggest the Fillet Steak with Roquefort Cheese with vegetables, rice and/or chips/cannarian potatoes."
( all for 11.95 euros Unfortunately tables cannot be booked.
One must take potluck to find a vaccant table and very often customers will wait at the bar to be seated   An experience not to be missed!
We will be back next year!
Food is OK
"El Mirador, or known locally & affectiontley as ""behind the dustbins""."
"Caught in a 70's timewarp decor and behind a big metal gate, which you have to toot for the owners to open, and into an overcrowded, small car park, behind some dustbins,lies this restaurant."
If you love fish then go here and order the sole.
"It comes to the table and is de-boned in front of your eyes, absoloutely fantastic."
A must for people who are fussy about not ordering fish because of the bones.
"We, 3 adults and 1 child, ate here on 30th Oct 08."
"Starters for 3, mains (Sole) for 3, desert for 2, bottle of white rioja and a kids drink, came to €95 inc tip, magnificent price we thought."
Fish was sublime as well as the veg etc.
Were quite happy to give an empty plate for the child to share our food.
"First visited this place some 15 years ago and was still the same quality food and worth the money, but still the same decor which made me chuckle."
Go and eat here you wont be disappointed
lo peor de lo peor
"Great food, lovely ambiance and very helpful staff."
I can't wait until I walk down the stairs again... :-)
The food at The Masena can't be faulted and the service is exceptional.
They even have pashminas for the ladys when eating on their terrace.in the evening.
"We have eaten in many of the top restaurants in both London & New York but have found none that match the Masena for quality, atmosphere & although not cheap, value."
"The food is imaginative, elegantly presented and always delicious."
Add to this an extensive wine list of quality Spanish wines at a good price.
Can't beat it
Well located restaurant serving overly large quantities of very average food.
"There are very few choices for vegetarians.The restaurant is brightly lit ,has absolutely no atmosphere and weird music playing in the background."
For those of you who object to smokers this place is not for you.
This is not a dining experience just somewhere to eat.
"Dropped into the bar and snack area of the El Cordobes for lunch , and the tapas was superb."
"Very reasonably priced , fast service and delicious food."
"Their dish of the day was a lamb stew, which was magic."
"Very helpful owner , who made up for my halting spanish."
"Went to the resturant in the evening , and some of the magic had gone, not a lot of atmosphere and fairly poor service."
"We've been to all the bars and restaurants in puerto San Tiago, and they all offer the same things really: chicken nuggetts, burgers, fries, frozen pizza."
We were very disapointed with the food untill we found Flor del drago.
The owners were professionals and you could tell they were happy to please you.
Food was excellent and beautifully presented.
"Home made desserts, fresh fruit juices."
"An ideal place for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
I would raccomand it to anyone going there.
Absolutly excellent!
"This humble little restaurant only does two things (grilled chicken and grilled lamb), but they are absolutely delicious, the plates are huge, and the price is dirt cheap."
It has become well known in the whole area and you have to reserve ahead in the weekends if you want to get a table!
Found this restaurant via a web search and from the looks of the website it seemed to be the real deal.
We wanted to try real paella whilst in Valencia and so booked a table via their website.
The restaurant exceeded all my expectations right from the start.
We were welcomed by English-speaking waiting staff and shown to our table in a very pleasant traditional style dining room.
"The choice of starters was good, and we opted for 2 starters between the four of us so as not to fill up too much prior to the main course."
The grilled vegetables were fantastic as were the Iberian Ham croquettes.
"3 of us had the Paella Valenciana (Chicken, Rabbit, Vegetables & Snails) although by request we asked them to hold the snails."
The fourth had the Roast Suckling Pig with quince sauce and potato confit.
To drink - well Sangria of course!
Apparently it's a tradition to drink Sangria with paella.
The paella was served and as we had room on the table we were given the option of serving ourselves which was just right as we could pick what we wanted and also get at that most iimportant part the socarrat which the light layer of semi-burnt crust at the bottom of the pan.
"The flavour, taste and texture of the dish was sublime."
We all sampled the Rast Suckling Pig and I found it to be absolutely gorgeous.
"Sated, thers was just room for deserts which we all sampled and found to be every bit as exquisite as the main dishes."
"The bill came to around 40 Euro per head which I found to be reasonable given the high quality of the food, In addition, the service was very attentive without being in your face and it all added up to the best meal I have had in Spain!"
we were at the Abac reataurant in agroup of five.
We all decided for the degustcion menu but one of our group has an allergy with fish.
So we asked the maitre to avoid fish for one person.
And he did not accept.
Only after insiting he accepteed to ask the chef about this and at the end it worked.
A pity.
"The menu was excellent, full of wonderful suprises, the somelier was great, very good wines for a reasonable price, the service was more than perfect."
an extraordinary place..
Forget the expensive Thai restaurants in the centre of the city.
This is the restaurant you want.
The food is better and it`s cheaper (The Menu del Dia is only 8.70 euros).
It`s not that easy to find but the effort you make will be rewarded.
All the food is freshly prepared and cooked next to you.
The staff (both of them)are extremely pleasant and will do everything they can to make your meal as enjoyable as possible.
I can´t recommend this place highly enough.
Cosy informal restaurant that serves an excellent quality traditional Spanish menu with a modern twist.
My husband and I stumbled upon El Establo after an afternoon of sightseeing in the Palacio Real and the plaza Mayor area.
We loved the atmosphere and were nicely surprised by the sophisticated touch in the traditional dishes.
We were also very impressed by the extensive and select wine list and the unusually wide choice of cava and Champagne.
(We were celebrating our anniversary)
What a lovely place!
"The day we had lunch there Madrid was celebrating the ""Virgen de la Almudena"" , Madrid's patron saint, and it was very busy everywhere."
"We opted for an alley restaurant, we didn't expect to eat particularly well."
We were wrong!
"The staff was very friendly and accomodating (we have two children, 3 and 6 years old), and the food was amazing."
"We tried different traditional dishes, everything was freshly prepared, even their desserts!"
"Our children ate absolutely everything, and enjoyed the full attention of the waiting staff and the owner/chef: VERY CHILD-FRIENDLY PLACE."
"We will definitively go back next time we go to Madrid, and we are happy to spread the word!"

We went to the Olive Tree the first week in November 2008.
The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the table is beautifully laid with quality linen.
Currently the price is 22 Euros for 2 courses and 27 Euros for 3 courses.
This is for a set menu of about 6 choices per course.
This includes half a bottle of wine per person.
Whilst the meal is being prepared you have fresh bread and hummus to nibble on - very tasty.
"The food was beautifully presented, the plates were red hot so your meal stayed a nice temperature however long you took to eat it and the portions were of the correct size for us to, just about, manage the 3 courses!"
Unlike one of the reviews we found the staff to be really attentive.
They were very friendly and chatty and we had a good laugh with them.
The Olive Tree was recommended to us by my brother who has been several times and always had a good experience.
My friend and I were fortunate enough to have a Barcelona local highly recommend this restaurant.
"The food was typically Spanish, perfectly prepared, and served with warm hospitality."
The ambiance in this small restaurant is arty with a bohemian feel as the local patrons heartily enjoy their dinner fare.
"Delightful, and inviting!"
"If you have the opportunity to visit and enjoy this unique culinary find, do not miss it!"
"If you are unfamiliar with Spanish tradition, be aware that most dining does not begin before 21:30 to 23:00."
It is common to see a full seating in any restaurant occurring at midnight or even later.
Babia is not any different.
One of the best tapas bars in Cercedilla
Some friends brought us here last week.
"The daily Table d 'Hote evening menu is good value at about 13€a head, which includes a glass of wine and bread."
"The service is remarkably friendly and efficient, and the food is better than you would expect for the price."
"We had a normal Spanish salad to start, a so so entremeses, a a good shank of lamb, followed by a reasonable vanilla tart."
"If you want a low cost evening out, you could do a lot worse than have an evening at El Faisan"
"I did't like it that much, but i've only gone 1 time so I might have to give them some other chance."
"It was simple, the service was simple too, and I didn't feel that feeling you need in an american tipe restaurant."
"Not really romantic although the meals might have a romantic look and taste, the service is a mess, the girls who work there have this ""diva"" attitude wich make them look silly."
(if you want to act diva go work somewhere else).
I imagine they dont act like that with everybody but we took our time to observe them and they did most of the times we went there.
"The meals are good, therefore I have been at the ones in south america and there is no comparison, south america's Crepes and waffles are just marvelous."
"The place is always croaded I imagine peole like it because it has a cool decoration, it is centric, it's different and the food is not bad at all."
"It took us a while to find this place, but we are SO glad we did."
"The restaurant is small, with amazing atmosphere."
If I were braver (or less self-conscious about being a tourist) I would've taken photos of the decorations.
The owner was very friendly and helped us decide what to order.
"For the price, this was one of the best meals we had on our honeymoon in Spain."
went to shunka for the second time the other night and this time got a seat at he bar which adds to the experience.food was tasty with simple presentation.
aparently they have opened a new restaurant around the corner called Koy .
got to check it out.
"Everyone from Ava Gardner, Bill Clinton, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, David Beckham to the King of Spain etc (and of course the many locals) have passed through its doors to experience the typical Madrid institution which is Casa Lucio."
"If the owner Lucio is in the house, and he usually is, (although lately he hasn't because he suffered a heart attack) he will come out and speak to the diners, and it is his charm and friendliness that has endeared him to famous and non-famous alike."
"The 'star dish' is 'huevos estrellados' or 'crashed eggs', which is a simple dish of eggs and chips but with a 'secret incredient' which elevates the dish to the 'amazing' category."
"Of course, if you are not an 'egg and chips' person, you can choose something else from the menu as it has good traditional Spanish dishes from Castille, (roasts, grills, meat or fish stews, fresh or grilled shellfish)."
"They also do a good 'cocido madrileno' (a 'Madrid stockpot', which is a very typical dish from Madrid, mainly eaten in winter, which consists of chicken flavoured soup, then chickpeas and varous meats (chicken, beef, chorizo, pork rind and vegetables)."
"I thoroughly recommend this restaurant to those who are willing to try typical Spanish food and will be receptive to Lucio's friendliness, and who knows, you might bump into a celebrity to boot."
"PS: Casa Lucio has a website, although it is only in Spanish:  www."

Lo que hemos sido y para que nos hemos quedado.
A classic to ''tapear de pinchos''
"Good and simple, no complications."
Seems like a very authentic Andalusian restaurant with reasonable prices.
There was a nice initial touch of a free starter of sauteed potatoes and cauliflower.
Breads were the standard crusty rolls and some excellent crackers.
"Wine list was reasonably priced and we chose a standard favorite, Rioja Vega."
"Salmorejo, a cold soup of garlic and bread had a rich taste."
"A dish of fried baby shrimp and baby calamari (puntillitas) was quite tasty, although the puntillitas were a bit gritty."
"Andalusian salt cod (bacalao) was served with shrimp, ham, and a nice sauce."
Grilled hake was nicely done with a green sauce.
We split a dish of ice cream that was well done.
"Our meal with appetizers, entres, wine, and a split dessert was about 70 Euros."
Menus in multiple languages including English were available.
Service was quick and professional.
Highly recommended.
"used this restaurant three times during our stay in benidorm even though we were half board in our hotel, the food was lovely as were the staff ."
"a three course meal with half bottle of wine,beer or soft drink euro 4.95 total."
"and the little girl who greeted you,could remember what you had the day before she was absolutely loveley."
p.s.
if she reads this i hope your tongue is better.
We have been eating at the China Garden since it first open.
We eat there at least once a week and are friendly with the owner and his wife.
We always recommend the restaurant.
Very friendly staff and good food what more could you ask when on holiday in Benidorm who needs all inclusive
"Been dining at China Garden for many years now, at least twice each time we stay."
The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced but the greeting and the service is what makes it special.
"They remember you and what you eat, we visited for both our fiftieth birthdays this year and were treat like royalty."
"But you only have to look around at the other restaurants on the same street, they are usually empty but you can guarantee that china garden will always be packed out."
Fantastic.
"Great atmosphere, yummy food."
"Service was fine the night we were there, but the place was not very crowded."
"A cosy, nice place, where you can eat late, without being fastfood."
"Very friendly service, even if a little confused in the beginning."
"You have to tell the service, you want to eat, or else you'll have to wait forever to become a table."
We visited this place after reading all the fantastic reviews.
"Like the post below, the opening hours are a little strange, especially compared to the rest of the bars in Spain."
It is a tiny little bar with no seating area.
There are three small standing tables where you can place your drinks.
"There is a small selection of tapas here, it is all fish based."
It is very reasonably priced at 30 Euros for five drinks and six tapas.
"At about 9pm, the place became very crowded."
Most of the other customers were tourists who I am assuming here because of Tripadvisor.
A nice little place which I would definitely go back to for a little snack and drink.
"Found this restaurant through this site, and had a fantastic meal here."
"We tried to go on the Monday, but found it closed, so returned the next night."
"The inside is lovely and modern, and loved the artwork, go there and see what I mean!"
We had the chef's menu and taster wine menu and every course was so fantastic.
"The service was second to none, with each course and wine described."
You really do get what you pay for here - excellent!
Do not forget to try the best Bacalado frito in Madrid
"What a shame, having booked this restaurant after reading many rave reviews."
Great food but totally indifferent service.
Nobody greeted us on arrival for several minutes & then once seated we weren't offered drinks so waited over 30 minutes to order our food & get some wine.
"Starters & mains were superb, beautiful presentation, we managed to order more wine during the mian course."
However by the time we were about to order desserts the waitress had such a frosty face that we refused to order further food.
I was looking forward to a delicious pudding & jerez but was not prepared to spend anymore money.
We expressed our displeasure & she shouted out some response in Spanish to a colleague across the tables !
We left without tipping & were told that two staff hadn't shown up for work that night.
Yet when two apparent friends of the staff arrived just before we left they were greeted effusively & served glasses of cava & wine at the same time !!
Such a shame.
By far the worst service I have every received in some fine restaurants worldwide.We were prepared to spend substantially here & would have had we felt looked after.
You must visit this restaurant if you are staying in Vejer.
The food is more expensive than traditional Spanish restaurants but it is well worth it.
"The setting, especially in summer, is fabulous, wrought iron tables and chairs in a beautiful patio area."
"Our favourite dish is the pastela (chicken and almonds in pastry) or the muglaba (mince, rice, sour cream) and of course the tagines."
Excellent restaurant situated next to the San Blas square.
Just come back from a weeks stay in Golf del Sur.
"Ate there on the Thursday and was impressed and returned the following Tuesday when they offer a 3 course set menu for 17.50 Euros, the food is delicious ."
Highly reccommend this place if you stay in Golf del Sur area.
Want a real glimpse of life in old Barceloneta?
This little Tapas bar in the depths of Barceloneta is the place.
"You will not find other tourists here, just the locals."
I kind of hate to tell others about it since too many tourists might spoil it for the locals and change the place.
"But, as it a one of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona, I want to share it with others of like mind."
"Don't expect chic, it is as real as it gets."
I found El Moll del Rebaix wandering alone through the narrow one-way streets that fill Barceloneta on sunny a Sept. afternoon.
Barcelonetta was decorated with bright red and yellow flags for La Mercè.
El Moll del Rebaix is the archetypical barrio bar.
"Small mismatched tables, a small wooden bar where patrons stand, and an eclectic collection of Hollywood paraphernalia decorating the walls (why, who know)."
"The tapas here are basic, but delicious!"
"They are prepared and served by Paco or Christian, brothers/proprietors who grew up in the neighborhood."
They were incredibly welcoming.
"When I returned another day, with several friends in tow-they remembered me and happily prepared an array of tapas for us, even though we came in after normal lunch service."
"We sat in El Moll del Rebaix for almost 3 hours eating, drinking and chatting with the locals."
"One of my friends (a Cuban-American) said the torta was the best he had in Spain, or elsewhere."
The crispy-fried whole fish were fantastic!
"If you are wandering through Barceloneta, or hanging at the beach, bypass the newer restaurants and tapas bars in the barrio and check out El Moll del Rebaix."
I don't think you'll be disappointed you did.
One of our favourite restaurants in Javea.
"Excellent value at lunchtimes and always busy in the evening, excellent food, friendly service and very good value"
we visited october half term having read good reviews with 4 adults and 5 children to cater for we were catered for by freindly staff and good service excellent food.
This restaurant is in a stunning location and the food is excellent but beware of ordering wine by the glass.
As it was lunch time my husband and I didn't want to order a bottle but were told we could buy the better wines by the glass.
We had two glasses each of Miquel Oliver's Muscat which they were selling at 28 Euros a bottle (we found it later at 13 Euros in other restaurants).
The glasses were large but I noticed that there was still at least one glass left in the bottle.
"When the bill came, the charge for 4 glasses of wine was an astonishing 40 Euros when a bottle cost 28 Euros!"
I pointed this out to the waiter but was told that wine by the glass was 10 Euros... although this was not indicated anywhere on the wine list.
"If the waiter had pointed this out to us, we would have ordered a bottle at 28 Euros."
We complained and a Spanish couple at the next table backed us up and said that it was outrageously greedy on the part of the restaurant.
But the restaurant wouldn't back down.
The set menu lunch for two came to 114 euros with the wine.
We paid in full and left with a bad taste in our mouths.
This ruined what should have been a very special day to remember.
the best
"This is a charming, traditional restaurant with an extensive menu and excellent service."
The staff are friendly and helpful.
It's a lovely spot to sit outside on a warm night or to sit in the cozy restaurant on a cool night.
Try the lamb with rosemary-honey sauce--it's amazing!
"i've just returned from a fantastic week in lanazorte with my girlfriend, the only low point in the week was our visit to this restaurant on the 2nd night of our stay."
"we decided to try it as a friend told us that it was a nice place to eat but here is what we found; firstly shown to our seat and offered our drinks which was fine 10 mins later our wine arrived we decided we would only have main courses 10 more mins and our order was taken half hour later we finally received our meals which weren't up to much but we ate as we were so hungry after waiting almost an hour for them but here is the best bit, while we sat waiting for our meal drinking our bottle of wine looking around at other coustomers waiting on their meals i noticed the front door was open and in popped a cat had a look around under some tablesans scaring 2 people rubbing their legs under the table half to death so then the cat left of its own free will next a small dog came in looked around and left then the cat came back in for another extended look around scaring the same couple again as they did not realise the cat was under their table till it rubbed their legs so the guy at the table chased the cat out the door and shut it we taught what else could happen and where is our meal..... a guy selling paintings walks in and goes around to each table forcing people to look at and buy his paintins which i must add were awful so he then leaves to be followed in by a girl who puts silly things on each table with a note she is deaf and that she is selling these things in order to make money she leaves after about tens mins of walking around to all the tables."
so to recap first was the cat then the dog followed by the cat again then the chap selling his paintings and finally the deaf girl selling silly little lights i mean really we were asking ourselves what kinda place was this.i taught that i was dreaming with half the things that had happened in there till i asked for the bill and saw that two main courses and two half bottles of wine cost 55 euro.
my advice is aviide this place with all you will as it seems to have been made popular amonst irish holidaymakes for what ever reason i have no ides perhaps its all the side entertainment as it certainly isn't the food.... get yourself down to a placecalled puerto bahia instead you won't regret it i promise.
"After wondering around the Rabmla for 30 minutes, we settled on this restaurant as the venue looked nice and it was fairly bus inside."
We ordered two cokes (8 Euros each!)
and 4 vegetarian tapas.
The food was not paricularly good and the portions were very small.
The bill came to 40 Euros which we were quite surpised with as this was the most expensive meal we had had in Barcelona yet the smallest number of tapas.
The Rambla does not appear to be a good location to eat as it is full of over priced restaurants.
The food in this bistro type restaurant is really good.
The lunches are inexpensive and sometimes just what you want.
Club sandwiches with good chips(not frozen) & salad.
Great salads with interesting combinations and dressings.
"All about 8 euros.The only downfall is the house wine by the glass (the white in particular )They do sell nice wines by the bottle, although somewhat pricey."
The service is excellent.
"For the quieter winter months they have introduced very comfortable seating (small sofas) facing the sea , so this is now a great venue for a morning coffee & a read of the papers."
"Un sitio muy agradable, buen servicio y la comida muy buena."
My family of four (2 adults and 2 12-year-olds) ate here on our first evening in Seville and really regretted it.
Complete rip-off!
"The set menu at around 17 euros per head seemed good value, but the food was poor, the service was worse, and the bill when it came amounted to around 120 euros!"
The worst meal we had in Seville.
"There are so many other places you can go where you can eat for under 30 euros for 4 of you... Do not go here, you will regret it."
"A great place for having fabulous ""Gambas a la plancha"" or the well known ""Callos a la madrilena""."
For shure a must for who loves tapas y canas.
Very good price also.
A verz special place for Madrid skiers through generations
"El Naranjo, what a place."
"The family and I dined there on the 25th, 27th & 30th October and 1st November 2008."
"A definite must is the ""Special for 2"" which consists of a half shoulder of lamb, cooked to perfection i might add, vegetables and a half bottle of house wine for the measly sum of 27 Euros."
The honey and mustard chicken for starters was really good.
"A good main dish was the Pork with a choice of sauces, Fillet steak, and of course, either the Sea Bass or Sea Bream which was magnificent."
"The deserts were great too, Chocolate Meltdown, Homemade Cheesecake and the Apple and Walnut cake to name but a few."
"All of the dishes were prepared and cooked from fresh, as you order them, none of your precooked, microwaved malarkey."
An excellent choice of wines are available as well as a good bar stocked with most brands.
I got a chance to talk to the chefs who were also the owners.
Their daughters were also chefs and waiting staff.
Service was good and staff attentive.
"On the first night we were lucky enough to get a table due to a cancelled booking, which we thought was a ploy, but no."
The next 3 occasion we ate there we booked and just as well as people were being turned away in their droves and to their disappointment.
A good choice of food and a menu to suit all budgets.
Good atmosphere and a cosy setting.
"We are gutted that we have had to come home, but we are already looking to book to go back to that area so we can experience the restaurant again,  Thanks to all the staff at El Naranjo for making our stay in Spain great."
"Fantastic restaurant, with a very intimate setting, very friendly husband and wife owners who take such pride in their restaurant and food, there is a great selection of Fresh Fish, steaks, chicken, lamb and many other dishes, with choices of side dishes."
Everyone who goes there will go back as it is so good.
"I have lived in Vejer and can guarantee that this place is the life and soul of the village, especially at lunchtime on the weekend."
The decor leaves a lot to be desired but the food and service are excellent.
Have an aperitivo and some aceitunas at the bar before sitting in the dining room to eat.
Ask what fresh fish or meat they have that day.
Recommendations from the normal menu include clams and langostines in a creamy spinach sauce with pinenuts and for dessert try the pistacio flan - homemade of course.
"Excellent, Fresh Seafood in old town Rota, Spain."
The entrées were priced reasonably at 10-15 Euros.
"The wait staff was attentive, friendly, helpful and spoke English."
"I had a wonderfully prepared freshly caught, grilled sea bass while my wife had a Rota speciality of Grilled Tuna with Onions."
"The dishes were flavorfull, served promptly with generous sides of vegetables."
"At the conclusion, we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complementary after dinner anise drink."
"Clearly, this was our best and most memorable meal after staying 7 nights in Rota, Spain."
You should try the callos a la madrileña...!!
!
"Hey, i will save you an uncomfortable time...You walk into a crowed spanish tapas place and you are greeting with a wall of smoke and stares...If you are in BCN for a short time go else where for a meal."
Plus they are closes on Saturadays...
"This is well worth searching out, especially for the vegetarians."
€10 set for 3 fantastic courses and a glass of wine included.
Salad bar especially gets top marks.
"Obviously if it´s this good you may have to wait, be we didn´t have to."
"I am currently living in Seville and think the city has a lot of great restaurants and tapas bars, but San Marco was by far the worst experience I have had here."
"I went following a recommendation, and although the interior of the restaurant is nice, everything else about it was awful."
It is a complete tourist trap.
"VAT is not included in the price of the dishes (unusual on a menu here), and the service is very abrupt in a 'pack them in, shove them out' manner - we were brought the bill without even asking for it."
We ordered garlic bread with cheese and 2 pizzas.
"I was looking forward to a nice thin crust, stonebaked pizza."
What I got was a disgusting (and small) pizza which had obviously been bought in frozen.
"It wasn't cooked properly in the middle, tasted foul and made me ill!"
"My boyfriend had a 'proscuitto' pizza which didn't feature any proscuitto, instead cheap pink coloured ham."
"I have no idea why this place gets good reviews, I can't believe that anyone would actually enjoy the cheap rubbish that's served here."
Avoid at all costs!
"I am of Indian origin so do fancy myself as quite a closet critic, and I have to say for value and taste this is one of the best I have come accross in Madrid."
The staff are all Indian (helped as my Spanish is rubbish) and although most the dishes are mild (the spanish are not fans of spice) they were happy to make my food hotter.
"I went with three other friends,,, we had a selection of vegetarian starters - the samosas were comparable to my mother's!"
We ordered a variety of chicken dishes for the main with rice and a selection of breads.
"Had no room left for dessert but the staff were attentive, food hot, bill did not give me indigestion and I would recommend to all."
What a gem of a find.
We chanced upon it by accident.
"The food and ambiance are delightful, and the service very friendly."
It is fairly small and smoking is permitted but there is a seperate no smoking area at the front.
"Prices are extremely reasonable, and the menu del dia served at lunch time is a steal at €8.95 for three courses plus a drink."
The decor is stunning and everything is served beautifully presented in lovely tableware.
"Our vegetarian friends were well catered for, and even the menu del dia was adjusted for their needs with no fuss and no extra charge."
A wonderful experience.
Nearest Metro Attocha.
We can't wait to go back for the shellfish paella.
Also had for appetizersa the fried artichokes (yummy) and clams with garlic and parsley (delish).
A wonderful inexpensive Spanish chardonnay (Rene Barbier) was a great match for our meal.
5 Stars in our book.
Popped in on a surprisingly chilly November night - not too busy and got a table easily with no reservation.
Keen to sample good shellfish and was not disappointed !
"Ordered the ""grilled assorted shellfish and lobster platter"" and was presented with enough food for at least 2 greedy people."
"First a heaped plate of mussels, clams, cockles, crab and some weird little spiral spiky things that looked disgusting but tasted divine- then when just drawing breath and shaking it down came part two - half a good sized lobster - about 4 crayfish and large prawns - all hot and charcoally!"
- yumm.
Other half had the seafood soup to start - again enormous portions - brought a tureen to serve at least 2 - reports are that was good and made with a proper fish stock base- and then baked turbot and veg which was a daily special and yet again amazingly good.
Couple of bottles of water -one of wine and a bill for about 100 euros - not bad in my book.
Service was friendly and efficient -and enjoyed the ambiance of the place- would happily recommend.
"After a warm welcome by Burkhard, the owner, we felt like we had stepped into a "" Spanish-Moorish Fairytale""."
This boutique hotel is filled with charm and ambiance.
The 'attention to detail' is unique and the restaurant is superb.
It's picturesque setting is perfect and the staff is warm and welcoming.
We would return there in a heartbeat!!!
!
"I have visited Restaurant Patria several times, mainly for their weekend lunchtime buffets, run during the low season."
The setting is delightful with excellent views across the countryside to the sweeping bay.
Although the buffet is self service - the attention of the friendly staff is second to none.
They serve drinks and clear plates away as soon as emptied - but you are most welcome to keep going back for more.
"The food is excellent, with a variety of starter-type dishes to choose from and always two roast meats, fish and hot dishes to try out as well, followed by 3 or 4 different desserts to finish."
No-one is rushed and the Danish couple who run the restaurant are very friendly and speak fluent English.
"I have yet to try their evening menu, but am convinced it must be something special."
Restaurante Patria is by far the best restaurant that I have eaten in on the whole of the Costa de la Luz.
The food is delicious with locally sourced ingredients and a creativity with Spanish food and flavours that other restaurants cannot compete with.
The service is always spot on with very friendly and attentive staff who are always smiling and appear happy to serve you.
The weekend buffets are relaxed and bountiful and the a la carte evening menu is something to really look forward to.
The menu changes regularly and I have been able to enjoy wonderful evenings watching the sunset over the Atlantic whilst tucking into a perfectly cooked duck breast or a beautiful piece of locally caught fish and many many more fabulous dishes.
"If you are travelling to the area, this restaurant should be number 1 on your list.."
"Okay, so the food was pretty damn good, I will give Café Milano that."
"However, the staff and bill were a joke."
"We ordered four beers (4 Euros each), three salads (6 Euros each), and a small plate of manchego cheese (4 Euros)."
"We received four beers, three salads a plate of manchego cheese, a basket of bread and five tiny meatballs in a romesco sauce."
We just kept the meatballs because of the language barrier.
"The meatballs were good, the bread was stale and tasteless, but good for sopping up the romesco sauce."
"An hour after our first request for our bill (we asked three or four times), we received a non-itemized bill for 70 Euros."
"We calculated that we must have owed about 38 Euros, plus the cost of the mystery meatballs, which we did not even order."
"Could service, five tiny meatballs and stale bread cost 32 Euros?"
I doubt it.
"After asking for an itemized bill, we were told that was not possible."
The waiter ignored us from then on.
"We tried to square up with the bar maid, but she was equally as disinterested with our request, only to start and argument with us in an excessively rude tone."
We are pretty sure they were just trying to take advantage of tourist ignorance.
"We paid the bill, and promised to leave a bad review."
So that is that.
In our opinion this is the best restaurant for a sit down meal or tapas at the bar in the centre of Cadiz.
"Dont go too early or you will be there on your own, get there too late and there is no space at the bar - try 10pm-ish Fri or Sat nights."
"The food is fresh and the menu extremely varied, dont miss the brochetta of duck and dates - too die for!"
The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming too.
"We normally stand at the bar but have eaten a couple of times in the main restaurant, which is pricey but worth it for a special occassion."
Not to be missed if you're in the Cadiz area.
i live in bilbao so i know wht i m talkin bout.
"tagliatella is always crowded, for th weekends its imposible to eat there, u must call before!"
"th food is of th best quality, and tastes simply italian!"
"they serve huge plates, so better if u order for two people to share."
th staff is very helpful and sincere.
"once in th bill appeared something i didnt order, but after letting them know, they quickly changed it!"
i highly recommend it!
I trusted the recommendation of a local friend for a family birthday dinner for 15 guests.
What a mistake!
The staff were miserable and in some cases unshaven - they did not smile once.
The welcome at the desk was indifferent which set the tone.
"The waiter did not offer a menu saying as a group, what they were going to do was give us a selection of tapas starters (which were quite good) and then lamb and salad."
No discussion or offer of a menu at all.
I did not challenge it since I thought this is what my chum had booked - but he had not I discovered later.
They just wanted to shift a group through quickly and get their money it was clear.
The lamb then was presented as joints on the bone for us to see and taken away - what returned was plates of meat that looked like it had been run over by a tram outside or cut up with a chain saw - revolting presentation and totally off putting.
The salad was basic and disinteresting.
"The miserable old waiters just chucked the food on the table, forgot our drinks orders and the whole thing was a disaster."
"The previous night we had gone to a place called The Market - FABULOUS - full a la carte menu, young, friendly and lively staff, 200 euros cheaper, much nicer venue."
We subsequently went to a sister venue and that too was fabulous.
The Asador building is weird and wonderful the experince once there is beyond weird and terrible - avoid at all costs you will just be wasting your hard earned money.
This one deserves to go bust fast!
"Only because of the gorgeous pink setting in the middle of bamboo haven, can i devote 4 stars to this place."
"John moons asian infusion palace is an amazing visit, the food is o.k but not what I´m coming for."
"The different bars, rooms, lounges and boutiques are what make up the place."
"The interiour design, the banjak and the outstanding drinks just makes it all worth a visit."
"Arriving at the red carpet leading in to the main entrance and the small shops, leads you into a magnificant world of your won, where you can explore and wander about for hours and let your eyes soak up each inch of detail."
Even a trip to the toilet is worth a visit.
A piece of advice is: avoid the (pricey) buffet!
"Choose a la carte instead, go for the yummie soups, the good sushi and try some of the currys."
"Have a drink outside whilst waiting for your table, and in this place it is definately OK to glam yourself up for an adventurous night before heading out into the crazy nightlife of Ibiza, only 10 km away by car!"
"Ok, quite small, very traidtional."
"Staff friendly (a little unusual in these parts sometimes), food tasty and interesting and great value."
Not stuffy like some of the seafront places.
Definitely go back (and have done so many times).
For most people coming on a holiday and staying in the southern parts of the island this restaurant might be unavailable because of its location.
The restaurant is about twenty minutes from Las Palmas and just over an hour from Maspalomas.
However I will encourage anyone with a car to visit.
The trip to the restaurant is an experience in itself with great sceneries and a possibility of experiencing the local style and architecture of Santa Brigida.
If coming with a car a good option would also be to check in at hotel Escuela with it´s gardens and central location.
A day in Santa Brigida is also recommended to visit the many bodegas and wine museums.
The restaurant is rustic and with a genuine canary ambiance.
When entering you will be met by the bar where they have all their cheeses and fresh vegetables on display.
The smell is lovely and makes you instantly hungry.
Different kinds of breads made of aniseed and corn will be placed on the table with tomatoes drenched in extra virgin olive oils and herbs.
I recommend most people to try the menu of the house.
"Gives you an idea for next time returning to the restaurant, and if not returning, you have had a taste of it all."
"The menu have local sausage, 7 herb mushrooms, stamped eggs, lamb, zucchinis and potatoes."
All dishes are modern variations of the typical canary food.
The restaurant have a large bodega.
"Ask to try the house wine, but make sure to have a look through the wine list; I would especially like to recommend the Murua 1991 with the fixed menu."
"It is not a cheap restaurant, budget about 50€ pp, but it will make you pleased and warm when leaving."
"The combination of good food, great wine and superb service makes me a returning customer."
Enjoy!
!
"The place was very pretty from the outside and lovely on the inside, but the food was horrible."
"It was so bad, that my husband and I took one bite and chose not to eat any more, even though we paid 13 euros each."
"I had a tortilla (potato patty) that was mushy and less than room temperature, almost cold."
The cheap grocery store tortilla that I bought was 10 times better than this one.
"My husband had an egg salad that had a brown ""skin"" over the deviled eggs as if they had been sitting for a while."
My second course was swordfish that was so overcooked that even with a knife it was tough to saw into it.
"The tomato sauce that it was sitting on top of had a nice flavor but it was cold and clammy, I was too worried about food poisoning to eat any more."
"My husband ordered the pigs feet which were 100% fat there was absolutely zero meat whatsover, and there was still some pig hair on the skin."
"I have eaten on a budget with very low requirements for years as a savvy traveler, I have also spent hundreds of dollars in fine European restaurants when the occassion warranted it."
This food was bad on all counts.
"When we told the waiter we just wanted the check and didn't want dessert (it was a set menu), he didn't even ask why or act surprised."
"When he came over to collect our plates he scraped off the jelly-like pigs feet onto the other plate right in front of us, it was really repulsive."
The owner scurried over to collect the money and never once asked us how our meal was or even looked us in the eyes.
THIS IS A WELL DRESSED TOURIST TRAP.
The Restaurant Az-Zait is one of the top restaurants in Seville.
"It is a small place, decorated with paintings and murals in bold colors (red, gold, black)."
"The chef/owner does not speak a lot of English, and this could put you off if you are not adventurous."
My wife and i decided to try the restaurant based on the recommendation of our hotel.
"This was my birthday dinner, and we wanted to have a special experience."
We were not disappointed!
"We tried the Chef's Tasting menu, which includes three courses, and is one of two fixed-price options (the other is an eight-course degustation menu, a bit more food than we wanted!)."
"Chef's choices were spectacular, although we would not have ordered these items from the menu."
"The starter was a foie gras dipped in gold chocolate, decadent and sweet."
"Our fish course was a cod with garlic paste served on a tomato puree, a nice twist on classic Andalucian fare."
"Meat was a beef filet with a sauce, followed by cheese (we added this, not part of the fixed menu) and then dessert accompanied by Brandy de Jerez."
"We enjoyed a bottle of Rioja with dinner, recommended by the Chef, which perfectly matched all the courses."
Note: drinks are not included with the fixed price menu.
"Even so, our total bill for an aperitif, dinner, bottle of wine, water, cheese and digetif was only 105 Euro, which we considered to be very good."
We enjoyed every bite!
The quality of the food and service was five-star.
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"""Live dangerously"" and try the tasting menu!"
You will not be disappointed.
One of the larger stands at Boqueria market.
"3 courses for about 15 euros is a great deal, especially for the fresh seafood."
Get the escarmala (aka cigalas).
Truffled soup w mushrooms as an appetizer and the Hazelnut mousse for dessert.
lunch menu is the best value.
delicious!
Great restaurant for a romantic dinner!
Outside are a couple of tables near the beach.
Very good seafood and lamb dishes.
Price range is for a three course meal including drinks and coffee.
"Local wine (1 euro a glass), fried small fish and some other tapas."
Ideal before dinner.
"great food, geat service"
We had the best ever veal liver at Da Bruno - fantastic food albeit a bit pricey
"Friendly service, food has excellent quality, dinner for 35,-"
Great place for Catalan style tapas.
Everything I've had here was excellent.
Open Sundays.
"It's a bit ""chain-y"", but you get good honest, quality food here."
Eat as much or as little as you want.
The canelonni were a surprise hit.
Classic Madrid chocolateria.
Churros were wonderful.
"The chairs were unconfortable, the service was very bad, the food was poor, no taste, everything was frozen and I'm not sure if the chicken meat was chicken or cat."
"It was a disaster, and too expensive."
"All the other restaurants were excellent, good service, very nice food and beautifull places, but this chinese was really bad"
I'm a regular visitor to this area of Tenerife and have sampled a wide range of eating places.
Last year while staying nearby I tried the fish and chips and they were delicious.
"Crispy batter,hot crispy chips plus cold drink."
Great!
Have been back again with different friends and they were just as pleased as myself Although DD's got new owner the standard was as good as ever.
"There are other things on the menus too, of course"
plus++++++the best place to eat in spain!!
!
"I dine oftenly at the Montiel and I always leave more than satisfied, eager to come back!"
"Marcus' service is always excellent, a nice blend of freindly warmth and professionalism; Ferran, the chef, always creates great plates with first quality all spanish products, he has created a great menu, check on his daily specials."
"They have over 80 different wines in their list, I always leave Marcus choose for me as I know he will suggest the best wine for what I have ordered."
The Montiel is a hidden gem and I urge everyone that read this to try it.
Just loved the food (Crepes) and the decoration.
Nice staff.
Recommend it for 2-4 people.
Brilliant food
Went to this restaurant while visiting my niece and her family who live nearby.
"We were staying at the Hotel Parasio which is about a 2 minute walk from this restaurant, and it was the best meal and evening we had in our 5 day stay."
"The ambiance, food, service and prices were fantastic, our party of 8 adults and a 9 year old were made to feel welcome the moment we entered the door."
We were supplied with free canapés and dry sherry before we ordered and warm home made bread.
"We all had different starters, Pate, Fois Gras, melon in port etc."
and every one was described as perfect.
"Mains were Fillet steak, Chicken, Turbot and others, again all were beautifully cooked and presented."
"We had no room for deserts, but were supplied with complimentary chocolates and Brandies or Schnapps, a very nice touch!"
The bill was around 400 euros but we thought that very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food we had eaten as well as the 3 bottles of wine for 9 people.
"All in all one of the best meals we have had anywhere in the world, and that includes the USA, Maldives, Caribbean and most of Europe so that’s saying a lot."
10/10 and would definitely go back again.
Not expecting much from a department store restaurant we were so pleased with our breakfast experience that we went back another day for lunch.
It is a huge place with different seating areas depending on what you want to eat.
The choice is incredible.
It is extremely well organised and the waiters' service superb.
It was good value and surprisingly they do not allow tipping.
"We enjoyed a Bruschetta and a Pizza, tiramisu and coffee What you buy is what it says on the label."
Italian food in a restaurant run by Italians.
"The staff I found charming, if a bit too anxious to get us through our meal (they did not need to relay the table) but I would concede that some people like to zip through their meal."
"No complaints about the food, but you do not expect gourmet pizzas, well I don't."
It was perfectly acceptable pizza.
"It was perhaps a tad more expensive than I thought it should have been, but it is in the city centre."
A pleasant evening
"We had ""Menu del Dia"" at Nuevo Restaurante, Calle Navas 25, twice while we were in Granada."
It is centrally located in the middle of the city.
It is an absolute delight to be able to find a restaurant that had a separate floor for non smokers.
It is very elegant and simply decorated.
The staff is incredibly helpful and pleasant.
They provided English Translation Menus to help us choose from their large variety of choices.
The food is very delicious and the portions are tasty and generous.
The Chicken soup is the best I have ever had.
The desserts are scrumptious.
"The presentation of everything was ""very sheik""."
I would recommend this highly to everyone visiting Granada.
This restaurant suffers from its location in the Placa Real making it over-busy at dinner time.
"However, have an early lunch here, ask the waiter what's good today, and you are likely to be delighted."
This tapas bar serves several tapas with truffle and foie gras as ingredients.
"Excellent combinations with risotto, eggs and pastas."
On a 4 days trip we went back twice.
The place is very busy and also noisy with young people.
I would certainly recomment thsi restaurant to my friends.
"No fancy decor, just some pictures of mountain huts and a view into the busy kitchen from the upper room."
This is the type of place where you can trust the waiter when he encourages you to try the scrambled eggs with zucchini and sea urchin.
"Everything we had was excellent, from the bites of empanada and chickpea stew to the rich bacon and cheese croquettes and the aforementioned zucchini-sea urchin revuelto."
"The flan was a little homely with none of the ""plate art"" that's so common elsewhere, and it was sooo good."
"We tried to return on a Tuesday night, but found that during winter, it's closed some evenings."
"About 2 blocks from Arguelles metro station, just north of El Corte Ingles."
Went to the wok as a large party of 15 people this summer.
The concept sounds fine and not many restaurants would/could accommodate that many guests.
There is one large central area where the buffet is set and one other where clients have to queue to get their meat/fish/prawns grilled or cooked.
"As the waiting time is purposely long on the queues, people tend to focus on the buffet."
"On this occasion, the buffet was not fresh, mostly greasy fried stuff and rice."
"Several of us were ill the next day, not all, only 3 of us."
It is worth checking if things have improved as the concept is very good and the prices affordable.
"If they have not, it is difficult to recommend it."
"Although a small menue, this is outweighed by quality and price."
"It was used by the locals which is always a good indication that it is good value,"
One of the worst places for eating.
The food is o.k.
"but... very uncomfortable chairs&tables, it is definately NOT a ""warm place"", very small and quite expensive."
Also one of the waiters was VERY rude.
I asked him if I could have a dessert and he said to with a strong voice and a very angry face that I should wait.
"Also, when I asked him if he could suggest some good tapas for us, he just said ""NO!"""
and he left the catalogue in english on the table (again with a rude manner).
"Until then, he hadn't bring the menu in english."
I would never go there again!
There are so many lovely restaurants in Barcelona that I find no reason to sit in a high uncomfortable chair and talk to unfriendly people.
Also it is one of the few restaurants in the city that smoking is permited in the entire restaurant.
"It's not just a pizzeria, there are also many other fabulous dishes."
Anything with foie or mushrooms is wonderful.
"Best Thai Cuisine in Barcelona, hum!!"
!
I dined twice in this restaurant.
The first time I quite liked it; I had bacalao as main dish.
"The second time I had a steak which was absolutely mediocre, if not quite bad."
"In contrast, the price was not mediocre at all."
Grilled meats are ok. After eating there one needs to send all clothes to the laundry -- air exchange is nonexisting.
Extremely noisy.
The Monkey Bar and Grill has developed a wonderful balance between nouvelle cuisine and a fabulous burger - strange but true.
The range of food here is amazing but even more fantastic (but not cheap) is a Friday evening with a guest Chef.
Being on the island for one week only we had the honor to taste the food prepared by Lucas Maes from Puerto de la Cruz.
An amazing culinary experience and one to be remembered.
"On these evenings once the meal is finished, you are 'encouraged' to sit in a coffee area which is a little rushed."
Nevertheless the flavors and tastes are well remembered.
The other two reasons to go to Tenerife is to see Mt.
Teide by Night (no joke!)
and the sunset above the clouds wear something warm and La Gomera.
If you enjoy good food give the Monkey Bar and Grill a try and do not be put off by the name.
We spent christmas 2007 in Barcelona and booked Botofumeiro as our christmas eve meal.
This was possibly one of the worst meals we have experienced.
My husband orded seafood Canelloni as his starter which was this watery tasteless pile of food.
I myself had seafood soup which was lovely.
"We decided to splash out being christmas and ordered a seafood platter to share, at 110 euro."
The waiting staff could have informed us that this alone would be enough food as the portions are huge and even though his English was first class he found this unnecessary.
"Our seafood platter arrived, lobster, scallop, langoustine, prawns, mussels and razor clam."
For the price paid you would hope that the shell fish had been cleaned.
"The scallops were gritty, the prawns still had the black vein running through them, razor clams were not clean."
We bearly touched our food as it was so unpleasant.
"Being a restaurant manager myself, if I notice my customers have left an unusual amount of food, I am sure to ask if all was okay!"
"Not here, not when we asked for the bill while the waiter was clearing our table."
For the 200 euro we paid this was truley an awful experience.
It seems like they get you in to spend money regardles of whether or not you have good dining experience.
A poor reflection of what Barcelona has to offer
Quite why some restaurants are stuck in the 1960s and still allow smokers to puff away in enclosed spaces is anyones guess.
Unfortunately de Gustibus is one of them.
None smokers are sent upstairs which means passing through a smoke filled downstairs restaurant.
Smokers get to sit at the best tables.
Once upstairs the food is probably as good as it will get for Italian food in Barcelona.
All the dishes were expertly prepared and quite delicious and prices were extremely reasonable.
A main course pasta will set you back around 10 euros.
We would love to go back if the restaurant becomes non smoking .
"we have eaten there on several occations, the food is great, location on the beach at Bolnuevo is first class."
booking is reccomended as we have been left out in the cold a couple of times.
the atomsphere is great.
"the portions are very big, especially for the prices."
the service is also surprisingly friendly and attentive.
"the grilled octopus and the potato and tuna salad are really good, and the desserts (particularly the cheese flan) are delicious."
"overall, this place is very moderately priced."
a dinner for 4 with drinks was less than 60 euros.
Yankee
The best concept of falafel dining I have ever eaten... with great falafel and toppings... Maoz can be a staple food there for every day in Barcelona....
yum!!
!
came across a new japanese in gracia which i enjoyed very much.
decor is really modern and stylish and food of a high standard.will go back
Nice mbience and very good food.
Quality wines.
"Cordoba, Spain is home to the La Mezquita – a former Roman Temple turned Mosque turned Christian Cathedral."
Cordoba and the Mezquita are a UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
And Cordoba is home to Salon de Te – a Moroccan tea house nestled back off the main streets of Cordoba.
"Salon de Te has a private patio and main room filled with lots of cozy seating and big, fat cushions."
"We shared a medium pot of orange tea (Euro 5.00), forgettable mini-pizza tapas (Euro 1.80) and a delicious cheese plate (Euro 3.30)."
Salon de Te makes a perfect break when you are walking around the city.

Very good pizza and better nachos
My brother-in-law and I got food poisoning from eating paella there on saturday 27 Dec 2008.
It's a shame as I was really looking forward to eating at this traditional catalan restaurant...
My husband and I spent several days in Madrid and several in Seville.
"Ironically, of all the places we dined this was by far the most memorable, and it is a French restaurant!"
We found this tucked away little gem thanks to Frommer's guide.
It is indeed as cozy and old world as the description we had read.
The food was wonderful and quite sophisticated.
"What really made this so special, however, was the owner/ chef who greeted us, seated us, prepared our dinner and served us."
"According to Frommer's, the gentleman (and I mean true gentleman) is named Marcel Magossian."
My suggestion: ask Mr. Magossian to make your dinner selections for you and then sit back and enjoy a delightful evening.
Fast & good
"Dec 2008 Frankly, I think that this restaurant should be down rated."
Indeed it is about innovative cuisine but when some of the most ordinary dishes like salad with tropical fruit sauce are just presented in a different way and charged 5 times more is just pure lack of imagination.
The wild mushroom dish was identical with the one I often cook home and the ravioli plainly tasteless.
If you really want to have a fantastic experience just go to Arzak for the same money.
Only after I have finished the first dish I have realized why Akelare was so empty even that it was evening – only 6 tables out of ca 35.
"If you have nothing else to do with the money you can try it, if you love food the answer is Arzak."
Value for money is really good there so I assume the waiters are rushing the customers because of these relatively nice prices so their choice is high volume of cutomers.
The wine list is quite good as for a lower mid-range place and please order local cuisine which is excellent.
"There is queue just after the opening hour (20:30), but this means the place is good."
careful!
which Glop?
"Now, we were searching on a recent December Sunday night for ANY decent place that was open (not Tapas) and stumbled across Glop highish up the Ramblas that was open."
"I don't know if it was just that it was a Sunday night , but I'd say the food was BAD."
"I ordered a meal of Cod with Ratatouille - the Cod was just ok, suspect frozen, but the Rat."
"was awful, from a jar I suspect, cold, fluid, not at all nice, and i like my Med veg!"
"Bread ( with tomato, olive oil) was inedible, hanging around far too long."
Partner's sausage with fried beans was OK. Best bit was cheap red house wine - a bit harsh - but reduced the general dreadful aura of the meal.
"I know there are more than one Glop , so just be warned!"
Menu in English but the three staff could not converse and did not understand that we did not want a rare steak.
1st course was cold followed by rare steak.
It was sent back and the chef stormed outside leaving the waitress to charcoal our steaks.
Not a good experience.
We ate at this restaurant three years ago and loved it.
Last month we ate there again - and it was just terrible.
On of us found a piece of glass in the soup.
The waiter did not even apologize.
The suckling pig was tough and greasy.
The steak also was tough.
The atmosphere is great but is not sufficient to overcome the horrible service and food.
"Japan foot, good quality"
Amazingly divine food.
Best food i've ever had and probably ever will have.
Had the matching wines.
They went really well with the courses.
Really good service and excellent attention to detail
"We had lunch there on a December Thursday, when the Table d'Hote Lunch was a very reasonable 14.50€ for 3 courses and including a glass of wine, bread and IVA."
"It would be considerably more expensive to eat there in the evening, but the set lunch is the opportunity to try their very, very good cooking at a very, very reasonable price."
"The service is impeccable, the place settings, table cloths and glasses are of high quality."
"And you look out over the sea, the beach and Montgo."
"The set lunch gives you a choice of about 4 starters, 4 main courses and a couple off puddings."
The restaurant is much more Spanish than most in the Arenal area.
"We went in at 1.30, and were the first customers of the day, within an hour 35 more customers had arrived I am sure that they do not offer these lunch time prices in summer, so try the restaurant whilst the offer is on."
I would like to say a very big thank you to Chef David and his staff for making our meal a very memorable one.
"The restaurant location has spectacular views, nestled as it is on the lower slopes of the Col de Rates overlooking the Jalon Valley."
All the food is prepared for the single order and not as a bulk cook.
The vegetables are delicious.
"Starters and desserts are prepared individually, and are scrumptious."
"Apple pie, Banoffee pie and Baileys cheesecake...mmm."
I have to say that the service and quality of food would not be amiss in a top 5* restaurant in London.
"The waiting staff are very discreet and calmly polite, and the sous chef appeared with our main courses."
Fabulous!
Enjoyed the tapas very much.
The broad beans were wonderful and the eggplant tapa was one of the best I have had anywhere.
The dessert I remember was called Berry Infusion and was a beautiful berry reduction over vanilla gelato.
It was a perfect ending to the tapas.
"We've just discovered Oustau and have now been there twice, it's in Altea old town, and is in a very old building, used to be a school I think, it's very quirky and unusual."
"In the winter one sits inside in the cosy restaurant full of nooks and crannies, and there is a terrace shaded by a tree for the summer."
"The menu is very extensive, with a large list of specials, the only slight criticism here is that a waiter, in good English, recited the specials to us, but there were so many of them, of course, you could not remember the ones at the beginning when you get to the end, putting them in writing would be easy for everyone."
"Having said that the food is outstanding, my last visit i had Monkfish mouse in a lobster sauce to start with, followed by breast of duck in honey - a fantastic chocolaty thing for dessert."
"Service was warm, friendly and efficient - highly recommended."
Cervantes was handy to our apartment so we ate here several times.
"We loved the octopus (served with smoked paprika, olive oil and potatoes) and the bacalhau served with roasted peppers and olive oil."
"Everything else we tried was just fine, and the house wine was of a reasonable standard."
"The bread was excellent, which is not always the case in Spain."
"I didn't find it any more expensive than other tapas bars in the area, which is a prime tourist area close to the big three art museums."
"The service was efficient and pleasant, and the premises were kept clear of the drifts of dropped paper napkins, cigarette butts and junk which afflict many bars in  Spain."
Obama's is a British African bar which hasn't been open long.
"It's 5 minute's walk from the Placa de Catalunya, if you walk up the Rambla de Catalunya.The atmosphere is chilled out and relaxing, just what you need after a day's shopping."
The staff are freindly and more than happy to help out with those of us you aren't that good at speaking the lingo.
"We were in Barcelona for 4 days, and ended up going every day."
Excellant !
!
For me the best Italian restaurant in Barcelona.
"CHEZ-SPICE, INDIAN RESTAURANT, LAKE VIÑUELA, MALAGA: AMAZING¡¡¡¡¡ we have been there and its a religious experience¡¡ the taste of the food, the views over the Lake, the kind staff.... Everybody has to go¡¡¡."
An exquisite atmosphere and you can enjoy more than 60 tradicional curries and nans elaborated in tandoori oven.
"The have a very prices too, 12- 18 euros per person."
Tlf: 650 88 71 00
I went to this retaurant because I found it on the Lonely Planet guide.
It is a lovely place just but the beach.
You wouldn't say that it's the best restaurant on the island becase it has white plastic tables and chairs and is very low key.
"The inside is lovely, there are seachelles averywhere and you can just eat overlooking the sea and the camels outside!!"
The owner is great and they don't have an official menu.
They just come to the table with a tray full of the catch of the day.
You choose the fish that you want and how you want them to cook it...just great!
If you are in Caleta de Fuste you have to go here...even if you are staying somewhere else in the siland it's worth the trip.
The whole experience was very pleasant although the service did go off towards the end of our meal.
Two big points - they need to serve more fresh vegetables.
The salad with the pastel de pollo was very small indeed and needs to be bigger.
The almomnd soup was delicious but the lamb was a bit dull.
The pastel was delicious.
We visited this restaurant twice within 3 days and it was most disappointing the second time - this review is based on that visit.
On the first visit we had delicious rabbit and a steak.
On the second visit we ordered rabbit again and chicken Gaucho style.
"Both meats were hard, dry, chewy and very salty."
To make it worse all the prices had gone up by at least 3 Euros per dish and the liquers on the house from the first visit had disappeared.
We went for the 16 Euro menu and were treated to a nice lunch.
Marinated salmon and a hot seafood terrine were both great starters.
A haddock dish was properly cooked with a creamy sauce.
Salt cod au gratin was a bit chewy but OK.
The highlight of the meal was Ponch Segoviano (a local trifle/custard) with a nice scoop of caramel ice cream.
A bottle of a fruity red house wine came with the menu and it was excellent.
Just a short walk downhill from the Cathedral in Segovia.
This is a small establishment situated directly near the main square - Plaza Alta - in Algeciras just along the shopping street called Alfonso Once.
You can maybe spot it from the barrel outside.
So it is in handy position if visiting Algeciras for shopping.
Inside is cosy and always seems to have a good clientèle - mostly if not all being locals.
They come to this place for some good food and excellent drinks served by very attentive and courteous staff.
Whenever I am in Algeciras my legs seem to take me to explore the variety of tapas and some freshly cooked food and then I am happy to forego a sit down lunch or dinner.
"I had dinner at Atzaro a couple of months ago, i cant say the food was bad, but for the price i dont think it was anything to write home about."
They ran in a bit of problem bringin my dessert... it took them over 30 minutes!!!
"I wouldnt go back to Atzaro, perhaps to the spa or lounge but not for dinner."
Beautiful view if dining outside and menu has typical dishes.
Though a good rule of thumb for a restaurant to be geared towards tourists is: 1) if there are photos of the dishes; 2) if it is on a main street or square.
"This place is more than likely meant for hungry tourists and did not have as eager a crowd as the other restaurant on the same square, but the vegetable paella was filling, the canya (draught beer) was ample, and the view relaxing."
"The gazpacho was not as good as the stuff in the carton from the grocery store, but was nicely presented."
We only ordered very simple pasta and pizza dishes but both were terrible - verging on inedible.
Strangely both main courses arrived within minutes of being ordered so can not have been freshly prepared and tasted as if they'd been cooked well in advance and reheated.
"Judging from the reaction of other customers we were not alone, there were plenty of other disgruntled looks and complaints."
I went to Barcelona last november 2008 and got the restaurant name from Lonely Planet Western Europe.
La Fonda is a very nice restaurant if you want to taste really good catalonian food at a very good price.
Service is ok considering it is always crowded at dinner time (8-11 pm).
Expect to queue weekends and holidays.
Perfect location.
Def have to come back when in Barcelona again.
I first heard about La Fonda on tripadviser reviews and thought we should try it.
We got there 15 mins before opening and were glad that we did cos we were the second group in line.
"The atmosphere is lovely, especially if you sit upstairs overlooking the giant windows."
We ate like kings for a very decent price.
We tried many things and everything was delicious.
The lamb was the most expensive on the menu - a whopping €9.60!!
And the meat literally melted off the bone.
"The tuna steak was also very yummy, as was the seafood paella and the fish soup."
I saw lots of people eating the black rice but i regret never having the room in my stomach to try it.
"We also had desserts which were just divine, as was the wine and the price!"
Would definitely recommend La Fonda if you want to try good quality spanish food in a nice surrounding at an affordable price.
It would also be great for large groups as they seem pretty capable of handling it.
"Having read quite a few reviews about La Fonda by other TripAdvisors, I decided to make a point of going there with my husband and our friends."
"Just off the Ramblas and down one of the side streets, we were glad that we only had to queue for less than 10 minutes to get in."
"You dont book, but wait your turn."
"We accepted a ""smoking"" table since we were ravenous and cold!"
The smoke was bearable but obviously noticeable.
The service was very efficient and the food arrived very quickly.
We were pleasantly surprised at the relatively modest prices considering the high quality of the food.
"We had the mixed starters which included calamari, some sort of potato croquettes, quiche and various other things."
"We also ordered a plate of grilled mixed vegetables which tasted great - aubergine, red peppers, asparagus, etc."
We also ordered a plate of beef carpaccio which was of very high quality.
"For the main, we had seafood paella which was of a very good standard and plentiful."
My husband ordered the braised veal cheeks on a bed of potato in a rich port jus; this was very well cooked.
"The only negatives about this restaurant would have to be their unwarmed bread and their desserts - I played it safe with a carpaccio of kiwi and strawberries which was very refreshing, but others had ordered a sorbet which was very heavy, and an apple tart/pie with custard which was cold and not very fresh tasting."
The crepe wrapped ice cream was slightly rubbery too.
"Overall, the food was high quality and the price was extremely reasonable."
"The restaurant was full of Spanish-speaking people, so we did not feel like we were in a tourist area at all!"
Definitely worth a shot.
Superb food only let down by higher than average prices.
The restaurant can feel cramped at times if full but is still pleasant thanks to the great service and hospitality.
All the dishes are full of fresh flavours and spices.
Special recommendation to the special selection main dish that can consist of up to 17 different dishes all served at once to share.
"Absolutely fantastic, fish, beef stewed, chicken skewers, pranws, chicken wings, vegetables, rice, eggs, everything for everyone."
Prices can escalate to EUR 40-50 per person.
"However, this is worth at least trying it once and then coming back but being more careful with one's selection."
"I was a regular at this restaurant, bringing friends and eating out at least twice a week."""
"I actually would have thought that as a regular customer, that I would have had some respect to say the least."
I ordered three vegetarian Pizzas and Salad to go.
"Upon opening the food at home for my patient family, I realised that all of the Pizzas had Specs of Ham all over."
"Not only did they ruin my evening, they were not even interested in making amends."
"To my surprise, I was told that they did not believe me."
"Unfortunately, this was their second and final chance."
Prior to that a month or two ago.
"I took away two pastas (Pesto, simple enough) with half a bottle of salt inside!!"
I could not event taste it talk less of eat it.
"Again, they just fobbed me off like I was totally insignificant."
My Time and Money will not be spent with La Tagliatella again.
This is my first review.
"I never write a bad experience at a restaurant, as these things do happen."
"But in this case, their smiles and charms are only for your money."
I wonder if they care at all about their staff who make your food.... Go somewhere else....
Great tapas.
Beer also was great.
Very close to the Barceloneta metro stop.
"It is small so if your party is large , keep this in mind."
You won't be disappointed with the food or service.
This is a friendly laid back place where the staff have a great sense of humour and are happy to serve you!
This is obviously quite a change from the coast especially Puerto Rico which must have the surliest waiters in Europe and I include Paris!
"The prices are good, less than the coast."
The food is excellent and freshly cooked.
The service even at peak busy periods is slick and courteous.
"We were never disappointed despite, erhm, rigorous testing."
We recommend the prawns in garlic oil with the avocado salad.
There are a few animals to see and also a small local museum which is free to diners.
Go there!
But note it is closed at night!
We ate here three times during our weeks stay.
"Great tapas-for-2 starter (12euro) would make a good light lunch, and also a great way of trying out some of the local foods (e.g."
"octopus salad, lanzarote cheese)."
Would also totally recommend the paella-for-2 (28euro) - LOADS of seafood.
"We got a free after-dinner rom-con-miel (rum with honey, a locally made drink) with each meal, yum!"
"Upstairs is nicer for a romantic meal, especially if you can get a seat by the window overlooking the harbour."
"Service was average, not over-friendly, but that didn't bother us in the slightest as the food was so good."
P.s.
El Grifo vino blanco seco is a great local wine and goes very well with a seafood meal.
P.s.
II There is a fishmongers attached to this restaurant if you want to DIY!
"This bakery shop was a bit small, but the food was great!!!"
"Staff service wasn't too bad, but they could be a bit harsh sometimes when serving because there was a short queue of customers waiting to be served."
"The atmosphere in the bakery was good - a very continental european style, dark wood, brassy, nice lamps on the wall."
"Croissants, coffee, apple tarts, ham baguette, little dognuts, everything we ordered was fresh and taste really nice."
They also do small savoury bites which looked very attractive!!
(a bit like tapas) My husband and I went there twice for breakfast and also got some takeaway pastry too for lunch on the train to Montserrat.
"There were some dessert/cakes/tarts too I wanted to get, but we couldn't take any more in our stomach or just to carry them around in a box on the start of the day..."
The Bopan we went to was near Diagonal metro station.
I believe they have a few other Bopans too somewhere.
I'd definitely go there for breakfast again if I visit Barcelona in the future.
"If you are in the area, a visit here for tapas is well worth while."
It is not shatteringly different from many such bars.
but it is typical and Spanish.
"The decor is classical rather than plastic, and the staff are very pleasant."
"The food is good quality as is the wine, and not expensive."
"They had an itinerant guitar player when we were there, which I could have managed without, but I can see that many of the clients would have liked his addition to the atmosphere."
"Not much more to add really, a pleasant stop for tapas."
"First, the prices are way to high, i mean on the seafood especially, i mean the service is good but still."
"Second, if you do go there, be sure you are getting the right type of alcohol becuase they usually fill the bottles with cheaps drinks."
"Third, terrible coffee... but perfect dessert."
We visited many restaurant in Barcelona.
This was the best one!
The food was delicious (we wish we could taste it again!).
We tried the sirloin steak (I read that it is their specialite) and the read tuna (half portion) as main dishes and they were both fanstastic.
The portions are not so big.
"We paid 82 euros for 1,5 main dishes, one starter, two desserts (also delicious) and one bottle of water (no wine)."
Obviously it is expensive (at least for us)... but I am still able to remember the great food's taste!
"This bar/resturant is situated in the beautiful small village of El Berro, a 20minuate car journey from Alhama."
"It is run by Alan and Pippa, a friendly, hospitable English couple, who also speak Spanish."
"With its relaxed atmosphere, great music and diverse clientel, its a fantastic stop off point if your visiting the picturesque surrondings."
"Once your in the village, it's easy to find, as it's just next to the campsite."
"The food is delicious, and very reasonably priced, with dishes ranging from local tapas and succulant chops, to Alans famous hamburgers."
"Along with their broad range on the menu, you can let them know in advance and order a fantastic paella, or even a curry for a larger group of guests."
"Its easy to spend an evening lounging in the bar, listening to music from the likes of jimi hendrix, to manu chow, and getting to know the locals and other English vistors."
"We discovered this place by accident, its near the Parliament but is the exact opposite of what you'd expect, unpretentious, very busy at lunchtime, huge portions, everyone from builders, students, businessmen, old ladies and very few tourists!!!"
The food was excellent and the wine far better than most provided with menu del dia.
We were made to feel really welcome by staff who made time to chat to us in our faltering Spanish despite the fact they were being run ragged by the demands of their enthusiatic patrons.
I cannot recommend it too highly.
Wonderful place
Tapeo
"We visited Segovia, in part, to taste its famous roasted suckling pig."
Jose Maria was recommended by Rick Steves as a place that a good choice for this delicacy.
We were severely disappointed.
Both of us ordered the roasted suckling pig at 20 Euros per plate.
"What was served to us was luke warm, dry and chewy."
It was not in any way moist and/or tender.
We came away really disappointed.
We loved La Penyora when we used to live in Girona.
"The restaurant is based on a burlesque theme, making the interior really look the part."
"The food is also very good, although helpings are a bit on the smaller side."
"Non the less the quality is excellent, and they have a good selection of wines."
Highly recommendable for that special night out.
"This has to be one of the best restaurants on the Island for stunning location,top notch,beautifully presented and imaginative food and smooth service."
We have been on our last 2 trips and are off on Sunday for Chistmas and can't wait to try it again.
Wonderful food.
Excellent service.
Beautiful views.
A must try!
Spoke with the chef and I must say he and his staff are all amazing!
Have visited this restaurant over past 4 years while holidaying at Matagorda on outskirts of Puerto del Carmen Lanzarote.
"Have always had a selection of sushi, always lovely fresh fish, beautiful presentation."
"Main course have had teppanyaki dishes sea bass, pork ,chicken or fillet steak."
Of these the fillet steak is best.
"The staff are lovely, friendly good sense of humour."
"You can put kimonos on to wear while eating, more than a gimmick, protects clothes if your chopstick rountine not the best."
"Free bottle of house wine, the red is good."
Bill never more than 30 Euros for two.
"Highly recommend it, have found it much better than rest of local restaurants."
"La Luna, Corralejo, Fuerteventura  Date: 2 May 2008   My wife and I have been going to Corralejo for approx 20 years now and have eaten in some good and some bad places."
"La Luna is situated on Paseo Maritimo Bristol,Corralejo, facing the sea next to the harbour."
"Its a bit beyond the tourist walks so lacks the passing trade and as such the mass produced, fast arriving microwave food."
"All meal are cooked to order, so be prepared to wait."
"It has an extensive menu with meats, fresh fish, pasta, vegitarian and not to be missed, local dishes."
The wine list is extensive.
On our last visit I ordered a bottle of Vina Sol to go with our fish meal.
The waitress apologised saying that there was none left.
I was about to order some other bottle when she pointed to a local white wine.
It was half the price and she said it was better than the Torres wine.
She was not kidding.
"We have at least two meals there, on each occasion we visit Corralejo and have never been disappionted, or felt over charged."
Can't wait until until our next visit in three weeks.
"La Luna will be one of our,"" places in the sun ""."
P.S.
"If you are a meat lover, the "" Shoulder of Lamb "" is a must."
Absolutely mediocre restaurant.
They do not seem to know how to cut ham.
Waiters are grumpy and impolite.
Dylans bar has friendly service and great food.
We had their gourmet burgers which were delicious.
My boyfriend rated their Guinness too and I loved the amazing cocktails!
Britannia Pub next door which is really cool too and has been there since the 70's and they own Dylans Bar.
"Very good sushi and sashimi, yakisoba weren't that great."
Lovely place and good food
Having been to several Hard Rock Cafes my wife and myself thought we would visit the Barcelona one recently (Dec 19) for my birthday.
The atmosphere and music as usual was fantastic.
The bar service was great and quick.
We waited an hour and a half for a table.
Not so good but they were busy (Friday night).
"We each had the ""Legendary 13oz Burger"" with a Caesar Salad between us."
The burgers were not very legendary and the salad was dreadful.
There are many versions of Caesar Salad but what we had was not one of them.
"One of the most easily obtained salad constituents in Barcelona is good crunchy lettuce, every bar cafe and restaurant does a perfect salad."
"Not, however the Hard Rock Cafe."
"The lettuce (outer leaves only) was khaki coloured and only spread over the plate in one layer, the dressing tasted stale."
"The salad was composed of drab lettuce, shavings of parmesan and croutons (not many)."
"And that was all, no egg, tomato, anchovies, ham or any of the other salad ingredients that you would expect in this dish."
Also it was an extra €4.95.
All in all a very forgettable meal.
"Peter Postance, Dorset."
Delicious!
The Atmosphere is amazing... great for people watching on the marina side patio.
The owner is very nice.
The servers are super great!
I dined here many times and each time was amazing!
Try: the half grilled chicken... yum!
The Gnocchi... amazing!
Good meat.
The best the sausages as aperitive
"We read an outstanding review of this restaurant in a newspaper, we had great expectations but we felt very disappointed."
It's superexpensive and the quality of the food is just average.
"An unpretentious eating place, old wood tables and tiled, stuccoed walls, exposed pipes and ceilings lined with wine racks and old wine bottles, Fatigas is a lively, warm and casual place patronized by young and old locals and tourists."
There is a bar up front and music throughout.
"If you want a quieter section for conversation, stay in the back area."
It fills up quickly so go a little earlier than the usual 9-10pm crowd.
We ordered several regular-sized plates of food for sharing and were quite stuffed at the end of the meal.
The blue section of the menu is in English but be sure and ask for a more detailed description of the dishes.
"We were lucky to have a wonderful local resident host us and she ordered an appetizer plate of olives and ham, potato omelette, grilled pigs ear (so we could have a taste of a local delicacy--actually good!"
"), a delicious shrimp dish , a very tasty house salad topped with bonito, a cheese plate, french bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flan and a scrumptious pudding for dessert and menta poleo as a digestiv."
We had wine and beer as well.
All this for 50 euros - and 4 people.
Service was brisk yet friendly and attentive.
"Located near Puerta del Sol along an area lined with restaurants, the area is safe and well-lit."
"I highly recommend this restaurant for its bohemian atmosphere, good food and very reasonable prices."
The place was recommended by the hotel we stayed at.
"The location on the port was great, the atmosphere inside only fair (it was too cold to eat outside)."
The service was very good--our waiter wasn't great but there were so many helpers and assistants that we were very well attended to.
"For appetizers we had tempura shrimp--mediocre but a lot of food--and anchoives and tomato salad--very good, but the anchovies at another restaurant we ate at earlier were better."
"For a main course, we had seafood paella."
This was a big disappointment--the cuttlefish were tough and the white fish in it were tasteless.
"One of the mussels didn't open, but they put it on the plate anyway."
The shrimp and langostine were okay.
The flavoring in the rice was not at all what I expected--salty and I couldn't detect any saffron.
The free champagne was a nice touch but ultimately not worth the very expensive price and certainly not worth the rating given to it by the hotel.
cafe / meeting point
Nice restaurant to eat typical spanish Tapas.
Recomend it for 2-4 people.
Good Sangria.
Not to expensive.
Well located.
wot a great place friendly and brilliant food i loved the staff and had a great laugh with them loved it.
"By the reference of the worlds most confidential sites and magazines, me, my wife and a girl friend of us choosed to go to the trendy balthazar restaurant."
i made my reservation at 9 p.m. on saturday 13.12.2008. at that night there was the most important football game between barcelona - real madrid match was taken.
city streets are enormously crowded and you can not even find a taxi and also the weather is heavy rainy.
because of those we were10 minutes late to our reservation.
"by the time we arrived, there were neraly 10 -12 tables free."
"First i entered the restaurant a waiter meet us and asked for our reservation in kind way, i had given my name and he found my name."
"when he was taking us to our table, dark haired, thin and the young guy who is responsible for the reservations and only talking catalan came near me ask my reservation name again and when he saw me on the list he said no no no."
"i tried to ask what is he talking about, he showed and push us to the door and showed his watch in a rude and a way of talking like he is cursing to us."
"I have been in many cities and those cities best, elegant, hidden and expensives restaurants this my pleasure to find restaurants and enjoying my time."
"For Balthazar restaurant and its stuff 10 minutes of being late result is cursing, rudeness."
"Trying to make a place trendy, or making its name a brand mark or attract high customer profile can not be like this."
İ highly reccomend not go there in barcelona there are many good other places there.
restaurant in a covered patio with eclectic decor in a horrible green setting.
food was average.
"service was attentive with numerous waiters, but with overpriced menu, they can be all supported."
I had dinner about a month ago with 3 more friends.
"Awesome food, great wine, good service."
It's located not far from Passeig de Gracia and it has been a great discovery.
Myself and my daughter stayed in Salou in October and went for lunch here as we really wanted some pasta and pizza!
We had a lovely carbonara and a cheese and tomato pizza.
It was so yummy and I will go back again when we visit Salou in May.
I was in Lanzarote last week and on recommendation visited this resturaunt.
I found the staff very unfriendly and in no way profesional.
The food was OK only.
Lots of other lovely places --Don't go here!
"On business in Tenerife - I was staying over at a lovely Apartment in Playa San Marcos, Nr."
"Icod de los Vinos, Tenerife."
"Often, when in new locations its very handy to check out reviews online etc for the best places to stay, but I have to say I wouldn't have come across Meson El Monasterio by myself !"
Its hidden away with no signposts that I could see pointing the way.
Thankfully the travel writer I was due to meet had chosen Meson El Monasterio to meet for lunch and emailed me the location on GoogleMaps.
"What was once a Monastery on quite a large site now has a fruit tree garden, lovely walkways around the complex and excellent rustic restaurants cleverly designed into the Monastery on multiple levels."
"I was so impressed, that I had lunch on two separate days there during my stay at Tenerife."
Truly Special A++ Quality Throughout
"Ate at the location by the Sagrada Familia,less than one block from front of Cathedral."
"Note it is on a very narrow street, easy to miss!!"
"Enter, pick your seafood as you would in a market and tell the attendant how you want it prepared, the food is weighed, you choose salad, bread ,butter,and drinks."
"Then pay for it and you will be given a ""table number"" then go and pick out any free table as you carry your drinks and bread with you."
"Sit down and as the kitchen prepares your food when it is ready your ""table number"" will be called and you get up and get your food."
At the end of the meal you are expected to return dishes and trays to the side kitchen window.
"We were there Friday evening Nov. 28, 2008."
"Costs as follows: 2 Salads E 7.00, >355 Kg Calamari E 5.29 ,.39Kg Tuna E 7.68, >22 Kg Tiger Prawns E 8.76, 2 Beers E3.60, 1 dressing E .60, 1 Bread, E .40, Total Cost E 33.33."
"Food very well prepared, fresh and tasty."
"We arrived when the restaurant opened at 8:00 PM we were first to arrive, by 8:45 there was a line outside waiting for tables."
"The clientele appear to be middle class, and young, not teenagers, young couples, We were definitely the oldsters in our late sixties but did not feel out of place."
"One other thing I'd reccommend one salad for 2 persons unless you are part rabbit, the salad was gigantic."
We went to this restaurant in October after reading recommendations on another site.
It was everything they said!
Some of the staff don't (or wouldn't) speak much English but you can make yourself understood with a few words of Spanish and some pointing!
The menus come in Spanish & English which helps.
"They do set menus with a choice of about 10 starters, 12 main courses and several desserts for 10 Euros!!"
"If I hadn't already read reviews about what a bargain this place is, I would that thought the quality can't be great, but it was fine!"
It's just a bargain!
"You can pick separate items for each course and it won't cost much more to be honest, if there is something you really fancy - given that there are about 30 or so main courses to choose from!"
"But if what you want is included in the offer, then even better!"
"We had four set meals at 10 Euros each, plus two jugs of sangria and a bottle of Cava plus two baskets of bread, and it came to about £12 each!!"
(And that was allowing for a poor exchange rate!)
Food is authentic local cuisine and the place was full of locals which is usually a good sign (one guy was English but lives in Madrid now with his Spanish wife and said they go there a lot).
It's not the easiest to find as it's in a narrow side street (although it was dark when we went!)
but take the address and maybe a map and it's not far from the Metro station (Anton Martin).
One tip - It only opens at 8.30pm but get there by 9pm if you don't want to queue for a table as it's always busy (we were there on a Tuesday)!
"We were first in, last out, it was that good!"
And you can watch football on the TVs if you want while you eat - the waiters did!
"Forget the tourits traps, you won't be disappointed!"
"Situated on a tiny street north of the Cathedral with very small and quaint outdoor tables and chairs, Bar San Teresas was a real find."
"Excellent tapas, great Riojas and charming servers."
It is a little tricky to find but worth the trip.
One of the three best tapas places we found in Sevilla.
Bring your camera because you will want to take a photo here.
This is a perfect image of the bar/cafes of Southern Spain.
típico y lleno de guiris.
Parece un super
"Knowing the Salamanca restaurant and bar scenery since almost 25 years, I am quite shocked by seeing that this restaurant is ranked #1 in Salamanca."
"Pinchos (as ""tapas"" are called in Salamanca) are indeed quite good, but if we talk of a full meal, I could easily mention 20 better places in the city."
This is a great place for a quick bit to eat.
Just off the Ramblas on a little ally of a street called Xucla.
"We stopped in on Saturday, November 29th and had two ""bikini"" grilled sandwiches and the ""suis"" hot chocolate for dessert."
Wonderful.
First night in a new city we wander the locality early evening if possible in the hope of finding a little gem sometimes we do sometimes we don't.
This time we did.
"The restaurant already had put up it's christmas decorations (late November), outside it had a chalk board with the days set price menu on it, 9-95 euros."
"Later we went back; the bread was warm from the oven,1 st and main courses would have been good at twice the price put togeather from fresh ingreedients."
"The food style is new 'International', rather than 'old hat Spanish for the tourists'."
Local ingreedients are used in an imaginative way and presented atractively.
The cost also included dessert or coffee.The wines from a short list were of good quality and carefully chosen.
"My wife and I discovered this small, cozy neighborhood place this afternoon, when it proved an opportune and especially hospitable respite from a cold and rainy walk."
"Sitting at the bar, a mere inches from a tray of fresh seafood and other pinchos, we watched as a plate of succulent calamari was beer-batter fried before our eyes, and with that, a plate of equally fresh ""patatas ali oli,"" and canas of quality Spanish beer, we enjoyed both a delicious lunch and a warm welcome from the owner, who kindly treated us to an extra round of ""canaitas pequenitas"", along with freshly-fried boquerones."
"We will happily return, and not simply because this place is within three blocks of our expatriate apartment!"
"About a 15-20 minute walk from the middle of the Ramblas, this restaurant was situated on the marina but away from the more touristy eateries which were very overpriced!"
We sat at a table outside in the December sunshine with our jackets off since it felt more like August with the heater lamps beaming down on us!
"The view was fabulous, looking onto the seafront, and the waiters, although they did not speak English, were incredibly friendly and amenable."
We ordered starters of calamari and a plate of 6 oysters.
"The oysters were extremely fresh as expected, and the calamari was good, albeit slightly over salted."
For mains we had the seafood paella which was very high quality with a generous selection of seafood.
I personally ordered a rice stew with lobster which was very similar to the paella but with more gravy - very nice indeed.
"Paella was 14 Euros each and the lobster rice stew was around 19 Euros; slightly more of a pricey restaurant, but all in all it was well worth it given the freshness of the food, the great service, and the amazing view!"
Very good and creative sushi restaurant with pleasant atmosphere.
"During my short stay in Javea I ate at a view of the restaurants but La Cocina stood head and shoulders above the rest for excellent food, all cooked to order, and desserts to die for, especially the home made baked cheesecake which I had to return for......."
The staff are very welcoming and very friendly and the restaurant is a beautiful place to dine.
The views from the windows overlook the windmills on the hill and they have a lovely sunny terrace to relax on.
A BIG bonus for me is that the restaurant is a no smoking restaurant.
A must visit for when you are in Javea!
"its what spain is, a great sense of culture, you breathe madrids history and old world charm here, the service is not that good, but what do you expect from 70-80 year old waiter who have worked here for more than 50 years, this is REAL MADRID, 1 of 1000 places to visit beforre you die!"
"We had a wonderful lunch at this local, rustic and very casual restaurant."
Great service accompanied really great food.
"First we had a savory plate of Jamon Iberico, then settled in with a wonderful dish of the freshest calamares gallega (calamari)."
Both were served with nice bread.
"Specifically, the calamari was served with a abundant amount of delicious toasted bread."
"Seek this place out, it's worth your time."
We ate here in November of 2008 and it was the best food we had on our two week trip through Spain.
This included a Michelin star restaurant in Barcelona which underperformed compared to Az-Zait.
I had the steak which was cooked perfectly and my girlfriend had the scallops.
Both were delicious.
The staff was great which is something that is not common in Spain.
I travel to L'Ampolla 6 or 7 times a year and I will always eat here.
"The owners are friendly and the food, while basic is really good and I think is good value for money."
I l love their savory pancakes as a starter and I miss their tricolor salad.
I bring anybody who happens to be staying with me there and they have all liked it
Went twice on our recent holiday to Adeje in December.
Had also previously been to this restaurant back in June.
The food and wine on both visits was excellent.
I had vegetarian lasagne both times and my other half had sea bass on one visit and steak on the other.
The service is also very good.
We will certainly go back on our next visit.
We ate here once at New Year's Eve 2007.
Never again.
"Overpriced, poor service and poor food."
We left after the fifth of seven or eight courses as we had begun to loose the will to live having been in the place for four hours and it was not as if tit was fully booked.
This may have been a bad night as we see so many decent reviews of El Mirador.
but it is not a restaurant i will risk going to again.
"One of the best places for typical food, and good prices!"
!
"Ideal place to have ""croquetas"" with a glass of wine o a typical ""caña madrileña"""
the best in spain
Most of all for foreign visits
Excellent atmosphere in Gothic Quarters just a few steps from La Rambla.
I love everything in this place and never go Barcelona without giving a visit to Los Caracoles.
An institute...
The best!!!!!!!!!!
!
This is another must on the list of GOOD tapas bars in Ronda.
Try the capotes and the patatas ali-oli.
Both very cheap and very tasty!
The Best Sea Food!
I had heard a lot about this place before.
"My sushi standards were quite high (Wakasa and Shunka are among my all-time favorite), but I was pleasantly surprised."
"For little more than 35 euro/person we had lots of sake, entree and main each."
"Try the ""variado de vinagreta""... amazing."
This resturant i always om my mind !
I will be back very soon !
So go there !
Absolutely one of the best tapas bars in Ronda.
They have amazing seafood but the best are the chipirones (squid) Delicious!
"it is the best restaurant of Cartagena, whit a big relation quality-price"
We received such a warm welcome here that we went back for our last night on holiday.
"What a shame we didn't find it earlier in our stay, but it will be our first stop to go back to if we do return to the area!"
"Really good quality, home-cooked food for both locals and tourists alike."
"Traditional Spanish dishes and slightly more international fare for the less adventurous, and we have tried to re-create the garlic chicken at home since!"
"A good wine selection too, and a superb digestif of local liqor de crema catalana (vanilla type flavour cream liquer), both of which went down very well indeed!"
The menu came in Spanish and English and German and possibly even French as well.
"It caters well to the holiday-making crowd it is used to in the summer months, or the expats all year round."
The terrace is heated in low season and quite comfy even in November.
Of all the restaurants in the square this seemed the busiest both nights - and for good reason.
"Staff were very friendly, spoke fluent English, but really seemed to appreciate the effort to speak Spanish."
best place in tenerife for a relaxing night out but rik should let u win at pool once in a while jan and graham do a great job and make everyone welcome -mik n lisz notts
"went to tenerife in aug 08 for 2 weeks, after being ripped of by many bars ,found a lovely little bar called in the pink run by acouple of very nice blokes[dave],after first visit went back every night,dart board,pooltable,nice and friendly NO RIP OF PRICES BRITISH LOCALS USE IT ."
"if and when going back to tenerife will visit in the pink ,"
This is tapas as it ought to be!
Just order a drink at the bar and get some tapas for free.
"And not just a tiny little bite, but a plate full of deliciousness!"
"Expect things like fried shrimps, fried egg plant, potato salad, etc."
"Don't except a seat, this all happens while you're standing at the bar."
"Great for people watching, by the way."
"The name really put me off as I was expecting burgers and chips, but I was totally suprised."
The restuarant is really lovely and clean.
The menu had a good selection and the food tasted great.
"I am a total fusspot, but could not fault anything!"
Go go go!
visited dan's in may 2008. if you have a good appetite then you won't go wrong here.
portions are huge.
breakfasts are big enough to fill you for a week!!
"steaks are cooked to your liking, perfectly, they must be, my mum went back every night & she's very particular on how her steak is cooked."
"the chef, a true scottsman, knows exactly how to cook it if you say ""very well done please"" mushrooms are not boiled mush either, but gently fried as are the onions, mmmm!!!"
"All in all, staff are friendly, polite & make it well worth a visit."
"We're heading back in three weeks time, & that's our first stop for breakfast after a 7.30am landing."
When we are in Moraira Terravina is high on the Agenda.
"The owners from Oxford are Justin and Becky who know everything there is to know when it comes to wine, ( without the Pomp and Ceremony that sometimes goes with these establishments ) They are a very smiley and ambitious young couple who always make you feel wellcome."
"In addition to the list of fine wines we have sampled the Tapas which are freshly prepared by Becky as are the lovely cakes that are forever present, which are a lovely accompanyment to the cheeses on offer."
"Its a lovely Hideaway located behind Eleven restaurant with Dim lighting, subtle and rustic colours and is a real gem of a place to while away an evening."
We wish them well !
!
El Muelle - one of our favourite family places to eat.
"Kids love it, and we enjoy it."
"No fancy food, good pizza, pasta and steak etc."
Worth a try and reasonably priced.
Ate at Mundo on the last night of our holiday so have been denied the chance to return again and again!!!
With so many delicious starters I could have returned every night and still not sampled everything I would have liked.
"Four of us dined, we were given a lovely round table in the corner, the restaurent is decorated in vibrant black and red."
Long red leather seating along both walls with black table and chairs to accompany.
The restaurant seats about 30-40 when full I'd figure but only had appox 15 diners the evening we were in which was so dissapointing when there is such fabulous food on offer and so affordable to think people who just don't know about it are dining in the many mediocre establishments that are around the resort.
"For starters we had Thai Fish cakes (3) served with a chilli dipping sauce, Sweetcorn cakes (3) served with avocado and spring onion salad on top, and also a warm chicken salad served with balsamic vingerette, all 4 were delicious."
"Also memorable on the Menu was Pumpkin and Parmesan soup, Goats Cheese toast with apple and red onion compote and several other salads and soups."
"Main course were Nectarine Salad for 1, Roast Duck served on the bone with potatoes, Fillet of Steak with horseradish sauce and my delicious Cod fillet served with Hummous, Ratatouille and roasted red peppers."
"Also on menu was local fish dish, fresh pasta with wild mushroom sauce and plenty of other choice."
"Desserts followed of a lovely light Tiramisu generously laden in whatever delicious Italian alcohol is used, a Baileys and chocolate mousse which got the thumbs up and a chocolate cake which was nice but a little heavy."
"Along with 2 bottles of vino, 2 Cafe con Leite and a Baileys coffee our bill came to 175Euro (before tip) To us this was Excellent value for money for a fabulous meal that finished of our week in Gran Canaria on a high note!"
"To find Mundo, it's at the Tenesor Apartments on Avenida de Tirajana in Playa Del Ingles."
"First Class service, great Cava, genuine atmosphere."
TapasMix
"Small but packed with flavors, this bar is a must-see for any fan of tapas."
"Family-run, the service is efficient and friendly, food and drinks are sublime."
Trust their recommendations if you are not sure what to order.
Expect to stand but it is worth it.
"House drink is the eponymous ""Xampanyet"", apparently a cava-like sparkling wine."
Reasonably priced.
I will visit on every trip to Barcelona.
Ranks as one of the best in town.
"We discovered Bodega de Pepe on a holiday trip to Frigiliana when we arrived late at night starving and found most restaurants closed ,The French owner went out of her way to supply delicious food from the limited supply she had left and even whipped up an omlette for a vegitarian member of our family."
We now live in Frigiliana and it remains our favourite place to eat.Prices are very reasonable and the welcome is always warm
"We looked forward to everyday's 3-course lunch menu of the day (menu del dia), which includes appetizer, entree, dessert, water or wine, bread and VAT for 8.95 Euros."
It's an incredible deal for excellent food with great service.
A comparable meal where I live would cost US$30+.
"Get there at 1pm when they open for lunch, or there will be a wait."
It's too bad they don't do the menu del dia on weekends or for dinner.
simply one of the best indian restaurantas I've been to (and after living in London for 9 years I have probably visited over 50 of this kind) the food at tandoori station feels much more healthy than some of the london indian restaurantas.
"I've been to...its also very tasty, service is suberb, and great quality for money too (between EUR 25-30 per person max) if you like indu food you have to try this one"
"http://www.restauranteelbuey.com/ We were lucky enough to stumble upon El Buey, Madrid, last Saturday night."
"They do not open until 9pm, but took a reservation and we went to a nearby hostelry for a couple of drinks (and free tapas to quell the hunger) beforehand."
We were very pleased that we had made a reservation...at 9pm opening time there was a queue out the door (although most seemed to have reservations!)
and the whole place filled within about 10 minutes.
We could see why.
"The service was excellent (attentive but not overbearing, and very efficient)."
"We had no major issue with the fact that we have very limited Spanish as the Maitre D' was able to advise us in English (also the menu at the door is translated, but they do not seem to have an english version inside)."
We opted for the specials - seafood crepes (quite good) and Ox.
The Ox was an experience!
"It is of excellent quality, comes raw and pre-sliced, and you are presented with very hot clay plates to cook it on, to your own personal taste."
The accompanying pepper sauce was some of the bast I've tasted.
The meal came with accompanying chips (also tasty).
"We had desserts of coffee cake ( a bit disappointing - very gooey) and chocolate crepes (very tasty and very filling - one portion would likely be enough for two), plus one coffee and a bottle of house red (very nice) and the whole lot was only €70!"
"This place is in the Michelin guide for a reason, the food was excellent."
And very reasonable too.
Try it out!!
And certainly make a reservation.
A little bit too expensive.
But tapas are delicious and very original.
"I have been going to this restaurant for many years as i am a frequent visitor to tenerife, the food is great as is the service, i'll be there in april with my family, can't wait!"
Visited New Years eve and was charged another 20% for the privilege!!
Had a fondue and they didnt light the gas properly so the oil went cold very quickly and ruined the whole experience.
"out of principal would never visit again, as I am sure is the same for a lot of others who were moaning about the extra charge."
Really good food!
Wok is a Chinese fixed-price restaurant on the entrance road to Moraira where for €9.95 you can eat all you want.
"The concept is fresh food, freshly cooked: you pick your ingredients, take them to the cook and they're prepared in front of you."
"So far, so good."
But execution is key and here Wok fails.
"It's scary to see raw fish, shrimps and meats open to view, that anyone can touch and who knows who did?"
On my last and final visit there were flies crawling around the noodles.
And the floor was not clean.
"Good idea Wok, but clean up your act."
"Very good, used to go every Sunday until prices went up ."
My favourite pick for fish and seafood in Barcelona.
Great place!
Always when I'm in Barcelona i eat at Botafumero.
Its old fashioned Spanish way of serving -bit grumpy- fades away with the first bite of Perceves.
Expensive but a must eat!
I have one comment: This is a seafood restaurant.
They are excellent in seafood.
Don't the risk to order pasta or meat.
"We went to Meson Antonio after reading the rave reviews on this site, however we will not be returning."
"Firstly the food was okay but pretty standard Spanish fare, but not particularly good value."
Our main complaint is that although the place is heaving with myriad bottles of wine there is no wine list.
"When we asked for one they said there were too many to list and asked us if we wanted red or white, assuming the house would be the same as most other restaurants we ordered the red which was okay but not great."
However when the bill came they charged us 20 euros for it.
When we complained they said we could always have asked!
Have you ever heard of a restaurant that refuses to give you a wine list.
Go at your peril!
"There are far better places, and more reasonable too, especially La Teja."
"My wife and I went into the market to look around and on the recommendation of Jose, our host at the Marina View B&B, ate at Quim."
Could not really see the menu on the chalkboard so we just pointed at dishes that others at the bar were eating.
The cava and tapas were great plus the noise and crowds of the market made this a great experience.
The tapas were not great.
"The tortilla sampler was mediocre at best, served inconsistently warm as if they rushed it through the oven when they warmed it."
Service was slow and they brought a couple of wrong dishes.
"Given the mediocre quality, it was overpriced."
Not a lot of charm or character.
I suppose it would be okay if it were the only place open very late at night.
Many other better places to choose from.
We ate at the Restaurant in the Las Cancelas Hotel on a Monday night when it was one of the few restaurants open in Avila.
Wine list was a bit pricey for Spain.
We got a good rich Ribera del Duero wine for 27 Euros after our first choice was unavailable.
"Our first course consisted of Castillian soup, a reasonable version with relatively little garlic, but a good combination of bread, ham, and egg floating in a flavorful broth."
Asparagus was served with two poorly matching sauces.
"Fried hake was cooked properly, but served with little more than a light salad."
"Cochinillo asado (roast baby pig) had a crisp crust, juicy meat, and a nice accompaniment of roasted potatoes."
"Meal with wine, mineral water, starter, and entre, but no dessert came to 85 Euros for two."
An OK meal but not outstanding.
"Myself and three colleagues managed to find this place in and around the old part of seville, We asked several locals for advice on a good place to eat this was by far the most common answer ."
"So we arrived and luck was shinning on us as they had a free table, as we soon discovered, the locals like this place and there was a bit of a wait."
"The young lady who waited on us was polite and very happy to help three englishmen, who could only say about five spanish words between us ."
"Wow the food was fantastic ,Fresh, Tasty ,Stunning."
"Thanks to the locals and the staff at the coloniales what a good ending to our business trip, Go and try it for yourself Brilliant place and atmosphere ...DazBungo England."
"This is undoubtedly one of the very best ""chinos de barrio"" in Madrid - a cheap, local restaurant ideal for families."
I'm a British ex-pat living in Madrid.I've been going here for a few years now and the quality has always remained the same.
"It's very crowded and noisy for lunch (with a fixed meal for less than 10 euros, including the drink), so I recommend going for dinner."
"If you want a real treat, ring the day before and order a pato laqueado - you get a whole duck, so make sure there are at least three of you!"
"As another reviewer said, the maitre d' (or owner, in fact) is a charming man, although I don't know if he speaks English - I've never tried!"
"Way, way too many tables for such a small place."
"The food was not good, and the Margarita was a joke."
Steer well clear!
"the place is excellent, I really love these restaurant."
the service is so friendly and helpful.
"they assisted us with the menu, and all was so good and tasty."
it was a magic night
Went to this place for paella on basis of recommendation.
Disappointing - paella was salty and gluggy.
Entrees were no better - $30 for 5 strips of anchovy and some bread?
Really!
"All in all, the food was less than good and the price quite a bit over the value."
There are better and more interesting places in Barcelona.
This one is for suckers.

El Figon was an adequate restaurant but somewhat lower in food quality than what we have expected in Spain from similar restaurants.
Seafood soup was rich and had lots of good seafood.
Artichokes with ham and garlic had a good flavor.
Loin of pork in regional style was floating in a layer of fat that was unappetizing.
Trout in the chef’s style was overpowered with ham.
Service was great and wine list was loaded with good Extremadura wines at reasonable prices.
Atmosphere was very pleasant.
"Booked for New Year's Eve, 2008."
"Given poor table, and when shown to table no help offered with coats."
Menus presented with no words spoken.
"First course arrived quickly, and then our main meal arrived before we were finished the first course !"
"Given that the meal was fish we had the option of either rushing a meal, or having it overcooked by being kept hot."
"The whole meal and occasion was ruined by being rushed by the staff, who offered no apologies when we raised it with them."
Our meal was over within 40 mins of arriving !
"Not only that but it was very expensive, and of average quality."
The next night we went to Il Vesuvio and had a great meal and service for 40% of the cost !
As a frequent guest at Thai Gardens i Barcelona I recently visited it's sister restaurant in Madrid.
It was however a big dissapointment.
The service was terrible.
We had to wait for a table although the restaurant was only half full.
After being seated we received ordinary menus.
We were confused since this was during lunch and asked if there was any lunch menu?
The waitressed just sighed took the menus away and brought us the lunch menus like we were imbecilles who wanted the lunch menu during lunch.
The food took ages to arrive but when it did it was really good.
However the service was terrible the whole time and when we got the check they had charged us too much.
After having asked to get this fixed and being met with the same sighs as before the total came to 36 euros which is almost twice the price as a normal lunch in Madrid.
"All in all, expensive very good food but terrible terrible service."
The experiience was in the end utterly annoying and I woud not go back despite the food being good.
tapas correctas a precio razonable EN LA BARRA.
"We, a party of 6, spent New Year's Eve at the Puerto Blanco."
"This was the second time we had done so and, because we had had such a fantastic time on our first visit for New Year 2005, we were a little concerned the restaurant wouldn't be able to meet our now high expectations."
I can report that they certainly did and again we had the most wonderful evening.
"The food, staff, atmosphere and setting were terrific."
Good pizza!
Nice & cripsy
I had lunch at El Foro today and was quite impressed.
"After exploring Parc de la Ciutadella, I started wandering down Carrer de la Princesa and this place seemed very busy, which I took as a good sign."
"I ordered off of one of their menus del dia, (only available at lunchtime?"
"...I went around 15:00) and got a large steak, French fries, a salad, a 1/4 liter of wine, and a dessert for only 10 euros."
"The steak was very tender and flavorful, and the rest was also quite good."
"Overall, I was very impressed with the food."
One word of warning... None of the menus del dia were in English and it took some decoding from the main (bilingual) menu to find out what exactly I was ordering.
"It didn't help that most of the staff's English was very limited, either."
"Still, it was a delicious meal at a fabulous price and definitely worth it!"
"After reading rave reviews, we ordered the paella with seafood, chicken and pork, only to get globs of pork fat, one shrimp each, many chicken bones, and trace halibut."
Very disappointing.
"To make our dinner even less enjoyable, we had the unfortunate experience of witnessing another waiter admonish an Asian tourist at a nearby table for asking (politely) for a small bottle of water in lieu of the liter bottle he was brought."
"After making a huge stink about it and insisting that this would be a, 'one time exception', the waiter scoffed, ""no drinks..and no wine?!"""
loud enough to create a spectacle of himself to nearby patrons and humiliate these guests sufficiently enough to garner an apology from the friend at the table who apparently recommended the restaturant.
Utterly disappointing.
Can't say we would recommend La Barraca for the Paella or the service.
A special place.
This was one of my favorite places that I ate at in Madrid.
It's located a couple of doors down from the Tony Roma's.
I ordered a steak which to my surprise was brought out uncooked with a skillet for me to make the food myself.
I enjoyed this experience quite a lot with a large Hef to accompany my meal.
Very enjoyable place to go with friends when visiting Madrid.
They did not have a wide variety of beers as I had expected but it still surpassed my expectations in terms of quality of food and atmosphere.
Reservations did not seem necessary although it did get fairly crowded around 11 PM as people to come to enjoy the beer and large food portions.
"Right near the opera theater and a short walk from the Royal Palace is La Paella Real – a slightly stuffy, but inviting restaurant with white-glove service that serves heaping mounds of paella."
La Paella Real is the kind of establishment that caters to local businessmen hosting foreign guests and well-to-do tourists looking for a nice experience.
The paella and cocktails were excellent.

Two minutes from main Square off a street called Lomo that has the best restaurants in town on it.
This restaurant is in a quiet street with outdoor seating.
Go for an outdoor seat if you can.
The menu is great - sea food and meat and the starters especially the soups are wonderful.
"The wine from Tenerife is a must Lovely localation right in the centre, great food and really good service."
The speak English as well and are so helpful.
Went there twice out of my eight nights as so good.
Closed on Wednesdays.
"The food, wine and service here is always excellent."
The staff are very friendly and speak good English.
We went here for 4 nights out of seven!
It's great value for money and it's advisable to book.
"This places is not bad, but nothing special for the high prices it has."
I lived in Mallorca for many years until recently and La Rueda was my favourite restaurant - but there is no point in going there unless you order entrana (pron.
entranya) which is thee best beef you will ever taste.
It is completely melt in your mouth and comes served on hot plates placed in the centre of the table.
The inside is dark and candle lit with some crazy stuffed things.
Service is always cheerful.
Magaritas are good and there is a good wine list.
"Finish your meal with ""hierbas dulces""."
I wouldn't really bother with the starters or desserts as they are nothing special tho the fried cheese is gorgeous.
You will get bread on your table and a selection of yummy sauces which you are supposed to keep for the meat but they will be scoffed in 2 minutes.
The desserts are gooey heavy sponge affairs and there is no dessert menu so if you don't speak spanish then you might not catch the night's (don't go during the day as is is dull) specials.
I'm sure they all speak some english anyway so don't worry.
La rueda is popular with locals.
You should book at weekends but week day nights are normally ok.
There is no parking so either find on street parking or get a taxi from palma (8 minutes away on the motorway - make sure they take you on the autopista and not the scenic route!)
or the surrounding area.
"There are also buses that run that way (get off first stop in genova, with the bank on the corner or your left, take the first road left past C'an Pedro - another great place but eat at the original one at the top of the road) keep going and you will see it on your left)."
PS- This place is not mobility impaired friendly - there are stairs up and down to entrance and the toilets.
"After attending inaugural celebrations for Barack Obama earlier this week, I was inspired to visit the Obama restaurant-bar in Barcelona, which was recently opened, since publicity was distributed informally on tables at the event."
"Imagine my surprise and disappointment on entering to see that the phrase ""British Africa"" used to describe the bar's theme refers not to some uncertain celebration of both cultures, but to a celebration of British colonial Africa, that is, to the colonial exploitation of the African continent and its people, a people which includes the new president's father."
"The restaurant's walls are covered with large portraits of British military personnel in full dress, a series of pith helmets crowned in feathers, and various other paraphernalia harking back to that unfortunate era."
"It seems to me that the use of the name Obama for this theme is in poor taste and continued exploitation, although perhaps there is some explanation."
Place looks very nice and staff is friendly.
There were four of us eating and everyone said that food is average at best.
Meat was clearly raw whe i asked medium.
"One asked his steak to be welldone, it was bonedry."
Food is also double the price then anywhere else.
So atmosphere is nice and cosy but food quality is just average.
"This little cafe has a privileged position on the old town side of the famous bridge of Ronda, and makes the most of its proximity to this attraction."
"Nice drinks and cakes, good decor, nice service (makes a change!)."
"Quiet when we there one evening in November, but what can you expect!"
"The cafe is part of what looks like a beautiful small hotel, with quality design throughout."
"No rooms seen, but we want to stay there when we go back just on what we saw in the foyer and toilets!!"
The only downside is the usual Spanish laissez-faire attitude to smoking indoors.
Probably not a problem in summer when you will want to sit outdoors lapping up the views and olde-worlde atmostphere of this part of town anyway.
Very pleasant atmosphere and staff made you very welcome.
"Food good, good value for money for Christmas Day."
Wow!
Could be my favourite restaurant in the world?
Take out a second mortgage to pay for it!
!
Should have been better food...
Cleaning and mopping should have been done before we arrived
This restaurant is in a small and beautiful Seville suburb called Heliopolis that was built for the 1928 Worlds Fair.
"It is a fine dining restaurant of the highest quality....white table cloths, gourmet food."
You will ONLY find local people here because it is buried in the the neighborhood on a non commercial street with very little traffic.
It has been in business for about 40 years.
If you want a real treat and don't mind spending a few bucks it is worth seeking out.
The only reason I know about this place is I went to college in Seville years ago and lived in the neighborhood.
Tourists know nothing about it.
Every time I visit Seville I make sure I have dinner there.
Their jamon serrano is some of the best in Seville.
All the food and drinks there are wonderful.
If you are interested in seeing an authentic Seville suburb walk around Heliopolis some sunny afternoon and witness the great Spanish lifestyle.
It is a nice break from the touristy hustle and bustle of the downtown area.
"I like that too, but they both have their high points."
This is the La Fonda just off the rambles/placa de reial not at the port.
We ate here twice after reading its reviews on trip advisor.
The first time was for lunch and luckily we just walked in we didnt have to queue.It is just as described in the reviews cheap and cheerful.
We had the mixed paella and a mushroom pasta.
Both were great value for money.The service however reflects the price.
"It was very slow for food although they warned us the paella was made fresh and there would be a wait when it came we then had to wait for the pasta, Also it took a very long time for the bill to arrive after we requested it."
That said we decided to return for Newyears Eve and I have to say what a fantastic deal.
For approx 53 euros a head half the cost of anything else we had been recommended by our hotel or found on the net we got a four course meal of lovely food (you would except to pay at least double the cost for) followed by coffee and free champagne or red/white wine all evening.
Service was also better on the evening but think that is the luck of which waiter/ waitress you get.Like anywhere some are just better than others
My husband and 2 kids ate lunch at Citus last week while in Barcelona over New Years.
"My daughter had the lamb, my husband a steak with little packets of cheese on top and I had the veal."
(Son eats plain pasta everytime).
We had calimari for a starter which was the best we had all week.
All of our meals were very good.
The price at lunchtime was reasonable.
The wait staff did not speak English and were a bit difficult if you wanted anything special (plain pasta for example).
Overall the food was good and reasonably priced.
We recommended it to a fellow traveler the next day.
"Ate here on 3 of my 4 days in Barcelona and while I may have missed out on many really good restaurants, I am a great believer in staying around when the food and service is as good as it was in Tapas Gaudi."
Tried 2/3 dishes I had never tried before and the staff were always helpful in assisting me to choose.
"Definately a ""must do"" on my next visit to Barcelona!"
The best Finnish place in Ingles!
"Free internet, magazines & other stuff for Finnish guests."
The evening menu is very good with lots of traditional recipes from the region.
The lunch time set menu is amazing with loads of delicious food for a very reasonalbe price.
This is a family operation and the service is warm and friendly.
Non smokers will prefer the dining room upstairs which looks out over the plaza.
My family has been to Babalu several times.
The restaurant is owned by a couple and if you go during the day you will usually be served by Olivia (originally from France).
She is a very friendly and warm person.
Food is good and definitely something different here in Valencia.
A caribbean influenced menu also with some spanish basics such as paella.
Menu of the day is a great value here at lunch usually costing about 9 Euros (drinks not included).
She has some good wines available on the menu for good prices so all in all you get a great meal and can choose your own wine rather than a menu of the day house wine as most places serve.
A nice change.
Our kids love to eat the chicken here too as its juicy and usually in a nice sauce.
They also love the desserts!
Definitely recommend a visit!
Located in the centre.
Went here for dinner as we wanted some good seafood and I had read good things about this place.
Here are my pro's and con's.
PROS: 1.
Amazing service.
All the staff was excellent and really took care of us.
They explained fishes and allowed us to make the perfect selections.
2.
Decor & Ambiance.
"While it does not have a Spanish feel, the place is real clean, modern and chic."
3.
The food was real good.
The John Dory fish in butter was really soft and excellent esp.
the grilled vegetables.
CONS: 1.
Location Location Location... it took about 15minuters to get here and it's really quite far from the downtown.
"Plus, after dinner there is nbowhere to walk to or continue with another bar."
2.
While they do serve fish...
"I was hoping for a place that had a huge fish display in ice with shrimps, lobsters, clams, fishes etc which I could then have prepared as I wished vs. a more fancy traditional menu."
3.
Prices were way higher than I imagined.
Indeed I would go back BUT this is more of a fancy seafood place a tad further in distance than I would have liked!
This restaurant can be a snack bar at lunch time or a restaurant with wonderfully cooked food in the evening.
We've been visiting this places for years and it is the best value eating place in puerto del carmen (or anywhere else we've eaten in Lanza).
"The steaks are particularly good - a real gem of a place, highly recommended."
"We found this restaurant by chance, walking through the streets of Santander, keeping our eyes open for something interesting for that evening."
There seemed to be a lot of people as soon as we entered because the first room is a tapas bar.
"We were early for Spain (just after 8.20pm) and were seated by Antonio, the waiter who proved to be a gem."
"The atmosphere is really very cozy with thousands of bottles of wine and small items used in wine making surrounding the 12 tables, including rows of wine bottles from all over Spain and around the world on the ceiling."
"We asked Antonio to bring us whatever was the best and freshest and typical of the region and had a wonderful anchovy appetizer, lightly sautéed squid with red peppers, a wonderful entrecote with great fries and the fish of the day."
"He brought us a 2003 Marques de Murrieta, a wonderfully aromatic wine with a very smooth finish on the pallet: a great find for around 24 Euros for the bottle!"
We highly recommend this little jewel in Santander where good restaurants abound.
We were looking forward to this restaurant having read good reviews.
It was certainly busy and everybody seemed to be having a good time.
"Our first courses were good, fish soup and baked red pepper."
"but we had gone, primarily, for the fresh fish."
We were sitting with a clear view of the kitchen and the piles of fresh fish.
It all looked good until it arrived at the table.
My husband's sole was huge and looked nice and moist as he cut into it but he found it tasteless.
"My fillet of hake turned out to be 2 steaks with a lot of bones, no taste and not hot."
This informal but high quality tapas bar/restaurant is slightly of the most touristic zone.
Friendly and prompt service.
"Wide selection of tapas (small portions), dishes to share and full meal."
After 21.00 (9 pm) it fills up with locals enjoying moderatly priced food.
Before 20.00 it is virtually empty.
Be prepared to read the menu in spanish.
If you go to Barcelona you can't miss this wonderful restaurant.
"Seafood, paella, special menu, everything is simply excellent."
Don't expect to spend only few euros because the quality is great but with about 30/35 euro per person you can enjoy an extraordinary seafood meal with a good wine.
One of the best restaurant in Barcelona
"Push your way through to the bar at this crowded local favorite for tapas a cut above the rest, including a peppery house pate served with ham and almonds and excellent free tapas, usually fishy."
"The pulperia across the street is an excellent place as well for pulpo a la gallega (octopus with paprika) and mini flamenquines of pork, ham, and cheese."
Davids is now in Business over 25 years in San Antonio and still packs in the crowds.
Unpretenious service and good food makes Davids a hit especially with the 18-25 agegroup.
Its speciality are its Pizzas but it is well known for its consistant quality of mid range priced and varied menu.
"Davids does not cater for the diner out for a ""Dining experience"" but delivers good food without having to wait around too long for it."
"Its bistro style has made the restaurant, situated at a busy crossroads, hughley popular with British tourists during the summer season."
"It's difficult to convey just how appallingly awful the service and the food is at this ""legendary"" Barcelona eatery."
A stronger culinary version of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' it would be difficult to find.
"I have travelled a lot and eaten at many 'traditional' and 'local' places, and I have to say that having been there tonight, I have never been impelled to write on any website or indeed anywhere, like I have now."
"Having come out of this restaurant, we walked through the back streets of Barcelona, where we saw soooo many gorgeous looking places to eat, which did not look like the staff would have died if they had broken into a smile and the food did not look like school dinners."
There is a traditional restaurant and there is also being mugged as a tourist with a plate of partridge!!
!
This is without doubt one of the best Navarro cuisine in the world!
!
Found it after several trips up the Casares Road.Coming from the coast you go up at Bahia Casares and it is the left just before the road back to Estepona.
It is a white building and looks like a villa and the name is on the front.
Not very clear.
Is is not a Venta but a beautiful restaurant.
Wondeful atmosphere.
Delightful staff and the best 11 Euro menu del dia for lunch ever.Run by the grandson of the founder.
My family and I love this unique restaurant with its friendly staff and wonderful home cooked food [one entry on menu-chicken like mama makes] [delicious].
We could eat there every day.
Tried all the dishes and can honestly say they are all exceptional.
Have been recommended to lunch menu but never tried it-told that there are very few dishes-and in my family there are 4 vegetarians-so we will just stick to evening fare.
Jesus who welcomes us and knows us well as all his staff is so nice.
Our grandchildren are 9 and 10 this year love it too.
We can't get enough of the place!
!
This is one of my favourite places in town.
"It's near where I work, and in many occasions I have lunch or dinner after work there."
"It's an authentic old little bar, where the older locals go for a glass of sherry on the evenings."
"Tapas are good size, the size of half rations in most other places and REALLY reasonably priced."
"It's run by a woman and her son, and they really do give you a personal service."
"The mother cooks the food, and the style of cuisine is what you could expect to eat at any traditional local home, so you get a taste of what traditional Jerez cuisine can be like."
"If they have it in try the CARRILLADA!, she does a REAL good one."
"You may find food a bit oily, but that is how people have traditionally cooked round here, with olive oil, which means it's good oily, not unhealthy oily."
"All in all, good value for money, you can literally eat and drink easily for about 6 Euros a head, so if you give it a go, you are not loosing much!."
Try it!
total rip-off...very very small dishes and totally over-priced!!!
"besides, it doesn't even taste special...insult to indian cuisine..."
"Jai-ca always has a good atmosphere, the crowd is often spillng onto the street and it provides the sense of a happening in Barceloneta."
So as a bar it's always worth stopping by for a beer.
"However, as a restaurant it's below par, and the food is greasy and dull."
"In general, the barrio of Barceloneta is very disappointing for food, mostly serving tourist tripe, and Jai-ca does little to improve upon this situation."
"They have no excuse really, given how many customers they attract."
"But then again, why would they change a formula that's so obviously working and bringing in the crowds?"
"Went for full-on nine course Joan Rocca tasting menu, with wines alongside, and my partner went for vegetarian equivalent."
Was worth it!
"Food amazing, wines perfect, and the accompanying service was outstanding - explanations of each course, and of each wine by the most friendly, young, non-patronising and interesting/fun restaurant staff you could meet."
"And aside from the memorable food (check out the menu online), there were fantastic little amuse-bouches (not just one) and creative bread that - like everything else - never strayed into pretentious but was always creative and worked!"
Cant remember whether how long it lasted (4 hours and the rest!)
but it was a memorable meal - and experience.
we were in girona over the holidays and found it very difficult to find genuinely good food.
on our last night we discovered la penyora.
we happened upon it accidently.
"the restaurant is thoughtfully put together and a little eccentric which, i felt, boded well for the kitchen."
"it's a bit pricy for spain, but that said, when you're used to irish prices, it was fantastic value."
we were served a delicious veloute as an appetiser....because of the language barrier i can't swear what was in it but i reckon sweet potato and parsnip would be a safe guess.
"it was divine, no artificial stock flavour at all, it was smooth and creamy and made me anticipate the rest of my meal with greedy abandon."
i was not disappointed.
"grilled, creamed spinach was outstanding, as was the canneloni with beef, mushrooms and truffles."
the whole dorada fish could not have been more perfectly cooked and the beef carpaccio with foie gras and truffles was the overall winner.
"desserts were a bit of a let down, but i think there was only one chef and you can't expect someone to be a master at everything."
our bill was 76 euro with one bottle of wine.
"i sort of wish i hadn't had dessert, just so i could say that the meal was perfect....then again, everything else was so beautiful that i can't say a crappy and overly busy dessert tainted my view in any real way."
"also, i loved the bordello feel to the restaurant."
This restaurant in situated in the old town.
Always busy and nicely decorated but our meal was awful.
"We were rushed into chosing wine and meal, then had to wait over an hour for it to come."
When it did it was luke warm and my husbands fish was half filleted and so full of bones was inedible.
It was by far the poorest meal of the fortnight.
Sally
"Ate here (part of the Cuitat de Girona hotel) on first night, due to a sudden rainstorm."
"A good choice of modern type of dishes, nicely presented, at a reasonable price, in stylish surroundings,  Noticed it was very busy, both evenings and lunchtimes, with locals rather than tourists, which is always encouraging."
One night we wandered down the road that leads down from the parador to check out a restaurant we had heard about from a local where the menu is whatever the chef happens to find in the market that day.
"We almost missed Casa Marcelo on the left, but there was no problem getting a table - mid-December 2008, the tiny restaurant was empty - so we decided to see what it was like."
"What it was like was superb...I was expecting something simple and homely, but instead we had course after course of wonderful subtle imaginative food served on the most exquisite china by charming staff."
"Highlights for me were the shredded squid... and the molten hake... and the mushrooms... and the two puddings: a dollop of avocado and of custard apple ice cream with lemon mini-sphericals and then the most wonderful supercharged 'bica', a local speciality."
Along with the wine an unusual and most interesting white blend from 2004?
"from a local producer, the total bill for 2 was about 145 euros."
In London you would be happy to pay twice as much as that for considerably less even with the Parity.
"Ok one of the surprise courses was a pig's ear, but I liked it and the waiter did give us plenty of opportunity to opt out and the whole degustacion was a bit unrelentingly rich, but still a wonderful unexpected delight and after dinner it's just a 2 minute stroll up to the Obradoiro front of the cathedral probably one of the most beautiful facades in the world."
"brilliant tapas,great bar staff really look after you"
"May be it was the unperfect coordination among waiters that was not achieving a high standard but the meal was delicious, specially the frozen mango dessert."
Excellent food in a very nice atmosphere in the outside of the restaurant (the inner part looked a bit old fashioned and not that very well kept).
Expensive according to other restaurants in Lanzarote but the quality was also higher than in the rest.
I spent a week in Santa ponsa at the start of August.
"and i went to the Slurpin Toad most days for breakfast as the food was great and the staff were really nice, i also would start my nights out there to as it is lovely to sit on the huge terrace enjoing the atmosphere."
The staff would dress up and get you all going with drinking games.
I would recomend checking this place out for def.
Good Restaurant.
Tipical and traditional spanish and majorcan food.
Cheap and excelent products.
Very recommended.
Their web site: www.copinyador.com
"im a bit of a fussy eater, but have to say food here is unbelievable, absolutely fab,something for everyone ant the cocktails....yum!"
"the staff are amazing, i dream of going back to thiz resort purely for this restaurant."
woul eat here every night if i could.
"normally hate food in spain , thank god for aroma!!!"
!
We loved this wonderful gem of a restaurant so much we went back again during our two week stay in Casares.
"The Argentian steaks were fabulous, even our two daughters couldn't get enough!"
"The presentations were unique, the food fabulous and the atmosphere relaxed and comfortable."
Just the place to be for a long Spanish lunch!
"We were excited about the prospect of this place, as Maribel's guide says some people compare it to Union Square Cafe in New York City."
Rest assured--as someone who has been to Union Square Cafe--this place is not even close.
"The atmosphere is okay (ask for ground floor rather than upstairs), and there are some dishes (like the lamb) that are very good."
"However, after we were seated, it took a full 20 minutes for someone to come to us (with anything--we didn't even have water)."
The waiter was only so helpful and was not at all attentive.
"We noticed that most of the tables in our area received this treatment, so we were not alone."
"Along with the poor service, our food was very average (except for the lamb)."
"Our starter, my entree and our desserts were below average."
The one highlight of the night involved the drinks.
The house cava is only 3 euros and is excellent.
And we found a very good bottle of Rioja that didn't break the bank.
"However, we couldn't drink enough to rid ourselves of the negative memories."
Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
Where do i start!!!
The food & service here is fantastic.
"Beautiful steaks ,prawns too die for."
If you love good quality food in a great setting this is the place.
I've never tasted as nice a steak in my life.
Thats including steaks in america.
Always book.
"Not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for."
LOVE IT CANT WAIT TOO COME BACK.
Totally agree with previous reviews - why is this place so popular??
Had Chateaubriand for two.
Like chewing an old sock.
"No apology, no nothing... and full price (not cheap)."
Def would not recommend.
"On the expensive side, but worth the money."
"Most people ordered sea bass under salt, where the waiters chipped away at the salt and discarded it while they fileted the fish."
"We enjoyed our mixed seafood grill, with tasty shrimp, huge mussels, huge slices of squid, salmon, and at least two other light white fishes unknown to us Yankees."
"The wines were well priced, in respect to other places on the island."
Highly recommended.
Fantastic food & excellent service at great prices.
Don't stick to La Rambla to be charged ridiculous amounts for substandard food.
"If you are looking for good, no-nonsense Basque food, this is a great alternative."
"Food is not fancy, but good quality and very well prepared."
I cannot get the grilled monkfish out of my mind.
We had a disappointing experience.
"The restaurant of this Parador Gibralfaro hotel was in the top ten of restaurants in Andalucia in our travel guide, so we had pretty high expectations."
"The view over the city is indeed magnificent, also when it is dark outside."
The interior of the restaurant is a bit outdated.
I think they need to refurbish.
"And the food, besides being expensive, is not very well."
"Some things are tasty, but we also had some barely eatable stuff."
The service is not more than mediocre.
So to be short: the view is probably worth the taxi ride.
"(Or the walk, if you are in a sporty mood.)"
"But keep out the restaurant, the food is disappointing and the service doesn't make up for that."
"Set in a delightful square in the Old Town, this bustling Tapas bar is very popular with locals."
Sit up at the bar choose what you would like to eat and watch it being cooked behind the bar.
recommend all fish and shellfish
"My wife and I walked in at 3:00 pm and tried to go to the dining room in the back but were told that we were too late or it was too full, not sure which."
We were gruffly told by a guy in a chef''s jacket to wait and sit at two stools at the bar.
Turned out that the gruff man was Pep himself.
He asked in Spanish if we wanted typical Cataluyan tapas and my wife nodded.
I told her that she had just ordered but she assured me that she had not.
"However, the food started arriving and the ""typical Cataluyan tapas"" ordered by Pep himself were delicious and different."
It was a great experience - excellent tapas that we would not have had the nerve to order on our on.
The lunch was on the expensive side but we both agreed it was a wonderful culinary experience!
"If we ever get to return to Barcelona, we will definitely go to eat at Cal Pep!"
The food in our hotel Coronas Playa was good but for a special meal out (it was our wedding anniversary) we were so pleased that we had chosen to go to Oscars.
It had the intimacy of a small restaurant and the meal was excellent also the staff attentive & friendly.
best tapas bar in Alicante!!
!
This was indeed our favorite place in Barcelona during a recent for night stay.
"The place was modern, clean and the staff simply super helpful!"
"We sat at a high table with stolls, all six of us and we just had a graet meal!"
TAPAS is what they do and the prices and portions were all perfect.
The Tuna Tartare was out of this world and the fried flowers with cheese inside were simply deliciuos!
It was obvious that this place is a local favorite bc the place was happening all night.
People coming in to eat at 11pm.
We had 6 pitchers of sangria were super tasty!
The menu offered many options including a great beef entrecote small tapas dish.
"Overall, this place was our FAVORITE."
I would suggest this place for groups or couples... it's not fancy but modern and hip.
Had dinner in this restaurant Christmas night & was disgusted at the lack of service.
We ordered drinks that took 10mins to arrive (even though the restaurant was very quiet) another 30mins for starter to arrive & at least another 30mins for main course to arrive.
We ordered a chateaubriand for 2 medium well & it arrived rare I sent my half back & waited & waited before I got up to ask when I was going to get my dinner!!
When it arrived it was luke warm.
No apology for poor service.
"When I paid for the meal, I said to the waiter that I was very dissapointed with the meal & he just pointed & said speak to the manager, when I spoke to the manager, he did not even acknowledge that I even spoke to him."
It was so disappointing to have a Christmas dinner ruined by such rude service.
There are plenty of excellent restaurants on PDC.
Lani's Mexican grill to name one.
Spend your money elsewhere.
"I´m one of those who think taht this restaurante is great""!"
but not only for its food but for its service!
great work
Went to Clandestinos late on a Thursday lunchtime in January for my husband's birthday and it was very busy - every table taken and people waiting at the bar.
"Hubbie had the Menu del Dia for 8.90euros (Prawn & Mushroom Salad, Chop Suey for mains and Malagan Cake with cream and Juniper Berries for dessert), I had the Duck with cider and raisin dressing and mashed potato off the main menu."
All very good.
"Slightly quirky in that the waiters are not the usual Spanish traditional type - look more like hippy students or goths, but very pleasant and helpful if you are struggling with translating the specials board."
"Wouldn't call it cosy, but it was buzzing with locals when we were there and we enjoyed the experience."
We have just returned from a week in Barcelona.
"This restaurant was magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible food, wines and service before."
"In fact, it was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the restaurant to go to back to the hotel after experiencing this dinner."
We strongly recommend this great restaurant to all food and wine lovers visiting Barcelona!
This really is a wonderful little place to eat in the Gracia district of the city.
We had the chef's suprise menu which consisted of five courses of the highest quality food I have sampled.
Coupled with the wine tasting our evening was a great experience and one of the highlights of our trip.
I really recommend giving this cosy restaurant a go as the welcome you'll receive and the food you'll eat will make you want to return!
From Pete and Jacky Jamieson We were there on 13th Jan 2009 and what an excellent restaurant.
You have to try the tasting menu where you don't know what you are going to get until it arrives on the table.
The guy in charge is superb and must speak every language n the world.
Don't be put off by the street it is in as it is a bit of a dump.
The restaurant is very much well worth the money and was a brilliant experience
We had an absolutely fab meal in this restaurant last night.
Chef's surprise menu-every dish was lovely.
Will say it was v expensive so save for a special treat as worth every euro!!!
!
"Unfortunately, we never got to eat at this restaurant as they made an error when dealing with our booking."
"However, if the customer service is anything like the food - I am really glad we didn't eat there."
Although they showed us evidence that they had made an error with our booking there was no apology from the management who were very disrespectful towards our group in the restaurant while trying to get to the bottom of what had gone wrong.
"We had come all the way from London to Barcelona for New Year's eve, This meant that getting an alternative booking on NY eve was night was going to be extremely difficult."
They made no effort to accommodate us at a different time.
I appreciate they would be busy on NY eve but at that time the restaurant was empty.
"So, we asked the restaurant manager whether he could give us any advice on where else we could go to eat."
He was unable/unwilling to offer us any suggestions.
We did find a after spending a long time walking around - Ichiban's.
Food and service were great.
My boyfriend and I were there and fell in love for the azulejos façade.
we didn't have tapas but asked for a table.
"we ordered the grilled mix of typical meat from beef to chicken up to different kind of sausages (chorizos and salsichones) accompanied by tasty sauces and potatoes... simply amazing... and last but not least...the home selection of desserts..a huge dish of profiteroles and pastries filled with cream or chocolate, mousses and slices of cakes... price?"
less than 40 euro for 2 people... ps.
cerveza is a must!
Myself and 12 friends visit Barcelona for 2 days over New Years 2008/09.
I booked a table several weeks in advance of New Years Eve.
"However, on arriving at the restaurant I was told that our reservation had been cancelled at 5pm that day."
"On questioning why this had happened, I was told that the restaurant had tried on 2 occasions to email me asking for further confirmation (I had already confirmed twice through toptable), and as I had not replied they had cancelled."
"However this was not the case, as proved by the restaurant manager who produced 2 emails that were sent to the wrong address."
"At no point did they attempt to contact me by phone, despite having my number."
"I can understand that a genuine mistake had been made, but they way in which we were spoken to by the management staff was disgraceful."
"They were rude and dismissive, and did not seem to care at all about the mistake they had made."
"Being NYE we asked if they knew of anywhere they could reccommend, to which they replied that it wasn't their job to find us somewhere else, and please could we leave."
"I wasn't expecting them to drop everything for us, but as they made the mistake a little help would have been nice."
"Anyway, if the food is anything like the service I would not recommend that anyone eat here."
"To be honest I only chose this place due to the ease of the booking process (what a joke that turned out to be), and after walking around the streets of Barcelona found much nicer and authentic looking places to eat."
Unfortunately this being NYE they were all booked out!
"Went to this restaurant, whilst staying at the Golf de Sur as it had been reviewed previously."
"Have to say, food was mediocre at best - think about bog standard Brewer's Fayre food and then go subterranean - that just about sums it up."
No atmosphere and expensive rubbish served up.
Wholeheartedly do not recommend this restaurant.
"Do yourself a favour and avoid this place, carry on up the street a few hundred yards and go into Tapas - loads of atmosphere, very tasty food and the live entertainer Roy excellent."
This is an awesome neighborhood restaurant.
The staff are friendly and the food is very tasty.
The desserts are homemade and are definitely a treat after the good meal.
Menu of the day is a great deal usually around 9 euros.
Go here.
Fresh food they grow it themselves!
"Authentic spanish wine bar, with a large selection of wines by the glass."
Each glass is accompanied with a pinchos ( cheese/chorizo) Loved it because of the reasonable prices and atmosphere.
Excellent choice of wines from the region.
Try the best of the rueda's and top selection of Ribera de Duero.
Recommend it and rate it as one of the most pleasurable bars in Salamanca.
Great place for fish (try the Dorada).
Always busy.
went on 20 01 09 10 pm.
"good honest home cooking,main course lamb chops about 10 euro."
separate room out back for smokers.have english menu which i find helpful.
The garlic soup is to die for!
!
We visit the island every year and always go to Fado Rock Steak House 2 or 3 times during our stay.
We've tried many restaurants in the area and Fado Rock has been consistantly the best by far.
"I always have a leg of lamb, its huge, beautifully cooked and a very good price."
My children usually go for a steak or the mixed grill and we've never been dissappointed.
People who go to the Steak House and eat fish should perhaps go to a fish restaurant!!!
Roll on the summer when we are out there again and I know where we will be on our first night.
x
A nice restaurant located between paloma park and the front - handy for all.
Service was attentive and friendly.
A nice menu with some good options and the food was very nice.
"Prices were a little high for food and, i thought, over the top for drink particularly bottles of wine."
We would go back but would probably choose more carefully what we drink.
ps apologies - visit was actually several weeks ago.
Been to tenerife first week in january 09.
Stopped for a meal here after walking up the front with my family.
"We were looking for a kebab place, the usual street sellers tempted us in."
"The place looked quite nice from the outside, and he showed us gyros kebabs on the menu so we went in."
It was quiet but it was quite early about 5.
We ordered a salad which was ok.
When the main meals came they looked like left overs bits of old fatty chicken shaved off a skewer.
"A green bean and tined tomarto mixture on the side which non of us ate, some chips and a pitta bread, about 10 euros a piece for the pleasure."
My son had sausage and chips which he left.
"When i went to the toliet the man from behind the bar came out, i put the seat down after using the toliet and there was a large amount of human waste stuck on the top of the seat and the toliet cisten, nice!!!!!"
After walking around the resturant we saw the chinese cook taking a fag break round the back of the kitchen.
"( very greek ) Have been alot of greek resturants in uk and cyprus, even my local kebab shop beats this place with flying colors."
"Put us off eating out for a day or two, made our own at our apartment."
Dont know if it was this place but wife had a bad stomach bug.
Stay clear if i was you.
"Excellent food, specially if you love fish or seafood."
Lovely atmosphere.
"We loved it, worth every penny (euro)!"
I agree 100 per cent with the previous reviewer.
"We visited Celso three times in three days, so delighted were we with stumbling upon it by accident in December (and I mean stumbled literally: we had been walking along the Adeje coast from Las Americas)."
"The fish is superb, the house white wine gorgeous (and cold), and there's a great buzz."
Try the sole meuniere for a real treat.
We paid about €35 (for two people) for three courses.
Been here several times over the years and never disappoints.
Friendly staff with great service.
Looking forward to our next visit.
We had a wonderful dinner at Casa Calvet in November 2008.
This was our first night in Barcelona.
We were able to make a reservation online weeks in advance.
"We decided to have the ""Gastronomic Menu,"" a 6 course meal with 2 desserts, all chosen by the chef for the evening."
We enjoyed everything.
"The food, service, and ambience were all beyond outstanding."
"On top it it, this is probably the only Gaudi building that a commoner like myself can be served a meal."
The suckling pigs were so cute and yummy too
Nice food and place.
"Big amount of food, be careful!"
The best italian food restaurant in Tenerife!!
!
Real Italian.
Home cooked.
"Excellent restaurant, very high quality traditional cuisine, very good service."
The best oriental food in Las Palmas at any Sakura Restaurant.
There are 4 on the island
Realy great food!!!!
!
The hotel and restaurant has to be one of the finest settings in Western Europe.
Magnificent.
"However, like too many Paradors, the cuisine flatters to deceive, leaving one somewhat disappointed."
"You get the impression that the setting is ""good enough"", so why bother too much with the food."
"Being ""Civil Servants"", the staff can sometimes come across as having attitude."
"Breakfasts are impressive, though, and worth the money."
JLR Score: 25/50
Gran variedad de tapas y en muy buena zona.
We sought out this restaurant on our recent visit to the resort on the basis that it had received a number of good reviews and we were not disappointed.
"We ate here twice in 7 nights and the staff were most helpful, especially as we had a pram and a baby who isn't the quietest!!"
"The quality of the food & wine was excellent, on a par with the marina restaurants in Puerto Banus (Marbella) and at a fraction of the cost you pay in the Costa Del Sol."
"My meal was so good the first night that I had the same again on our second visit, Carpaccio of Beef followed by the Grilled Prawns on a bed of Spinach and Rice."
"My wife too repeated the order the second time, Carpaccio of Beef with the Grilled Fish with Seafood Risotto."
I can also recommend the Marques de Caceres White Rioja.
"It's not the biggest of restaurants so probably best to book, it's worth it."
"Very cheap yeah, but in the worst sense of the word."
It calls itself Japanase but it is far far from Japanase food.
"Owners and management are Chinese, as well as waiters and FOOD!!"
"So while you are expecting to find some nice sushi, hosomaki, futomaki, etc."
what you find yourself eating is a hybrid of Japanese with bad Chinese.
So don't be surprise if you find Chinese spring rolls on the sushi-train.
"I do not have anything against Chinese food, but on top of it all the quality of the food is quite poor."
"Price is not cheap, it'd be if it really could call itself Japanese."
Service is fine.
One of the best buys for the money.
"good ambience, excellent food & service."
Head and shoulders above the rest.
Expect to pay a little more - but not much more - than other places in the area.
"However, as soon as the food (made to order - so nothing on the bar) arrives, you'll be able to see where that bit extra goes."
The Foie and croquete (not like any croquete you will have had.... super thin pastry and delicious filling deep fried) are stunning.
Enjoy
"Montiel is one of our first choices both for romantic quiet dinner/lunch or even for group celebrations, since upstairs a group can be comfortably on their own."
I've recommended it several times in the BCN forum.
"When I recommend it to people who have never been there, I usually send them this link so that they can see the place beforehand: http://www.bcnrestaurantes.com/barcelona.asp?restaurante=montiel-espai-gastronomic"
nice service but food was no big deal.
"Surrounded as it is by the samey menus (pizza, pasta, tasteless fish, equally tasteless paella), Mundo is a breath of fresh air in the tourist area of the island."
"These two guys have a refreshingly different menu with fresh food, well prepared and presented."
I haven't been to Gran Canaria for nearly 4 years and the main reason was the lack of decent food outside pizza/pasta/steak/fish and chips.
Reading about Mundo on Trip Advisor gave us hope and they lived up to their reputation.
We ate here three times in eight days and struggled to find anything close on the other days.
Visit here at least once while in Playa del Ingles!
!
We have eaten here many times and each time the food has been special.
Whether its been a local fish dish like red snapper or a simple pizza its been cooked to perfection.
Claude and his friendly staff have always been very welcoming and taken time to explain exactly how each dish is cooked.
"The roof terrace on a balmy evening is as romantic a setting as you will find, with the sound of the sea lapping on the pebbled beach with just the storm lanterns for illumination who could ask for more."
Although sea food is the speciality of the chef I can honestly say I have never eaten a better steak.
"We take time out on each trip to Fuerteventura to visit Claude's fabulous restaurant at least once a week, its a little further away but well worth the trip."
Good place to start the night in Chueca
I can honestly say I had one of my favorite meals here.
I've done a lot of traveling and generally eat quite well so I have lots of experiences to compare it to.
The decor was elegant but understated.
"The service was relaxed and informal, but polite and knowledgeable."
Each course was perfectly planned and executed and flowed well from one to the next.
"This may not be satisfying comfort food, but it is a fantastic taste experience for those with an appreciative palate."
"Don't miss this if you're a fan of modern, innovative cuisine."
"When you see locals waiting outside for a table, you know it must be good."
And it doesn't disappoint.
"The food is delicious, the dining room is romantic, but the restaurant really earns its great reputation for the fantastic value."
Near Casa Batllo.
Great restaurant!
"Amazing value, great service, fantastic ambience, consistently good (although not amazing) food."
We went back 4 times during our short stay in Barcelona.
Save room for the desserts.
You can't go wrong at La Rita - highly recommended (filled with locals who know they're got a winner here!)
"Always great food, and great service - and not too expensive!"
We ate at a couple of the stands in the market and found this one to be the best value.
One of the nicest old cafe in Madrid
"Tapac24 is a fantastic place to sit and drink great red wine and eat delicious food, the lovely staff explained all the food to us in english and everything was delicious - the outside tables were a great place to watch the world go by - my favourite in Barcelona"
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Barcelona.
You can eat ouside in the square and the food is moderately priced.
The tiramisu is excellent and I have eaten tiramisu just about everywhere in the world.
You can't go wrong with this choice.
We started off with white sangria in the bar and were told a table was no problem even though it was Friday night.
The bar is full of comfortable couches and exotic lights and a great place to start your evening.
The sangria was lovely and very well presented with lots of fruit.
We moved over to the restaurant and the food was glorious.
"I had a fantastic pork fillet beautifully cooked, I was very impressed."
The Canary potatoes were a tasty accompaniment and all the vegetables were of a very high standard.
Wine was reasonable and a great choice of wines too.
Best of all though was the baked chocolate dessert.
"It was the best I have ever had, you have to wait 20 minutes but it is well worth it."
"It is almost like a cake with a shell, and the chocolate flavour is so intense."
This place has a really different menu and is well worth a visit during your holiday.
Check out the website for the menus www.monkeybartenerife.com
"I've been there last week, and honestly the food is quite good, above the average."
"But remember is seafood with nice views to the harbour, so it means is quite expensive."
"We paid 140 Euros for 2 people, just one bottle of wine, average price."
So well worth a visit to this restaurant if you want excellent mediterranean seafood.
"Valet parking available, that's nice on that location."
We have eaten here on many occasions and have never been disappointed.
The service is incredible and the food is superb.
The steak with blue cheese sauce dish will be my last meal if l ever end up on death row!.
If you think the bodega is good then this will blow your taste buds.
"I've eaten her twice, in 2001 and 2008."
"There are many more economical restaurants in Segovia, and lots of them that feature roasts."
"At Candido's you get ambiance (it's right next to the aqueduct), the tradition (Don Cándido started the restaurant decades ago) and good cochinillo asado (roast suckiling pig)."
I took a group of 18 people here in August; they put us in an upper room with a GREAT view of the aqueduct.
"For 25 euros each, we got 2 whole cochinillos, water or wine, and each person had a very good salad and tarta de ponche (a typical cake)."
The service was good but it wouldn't hurt the waiters if they smiled more.
The staff was VERY accomodating.
"The owner (I think he is Don Cándido's grandson) came in, gave us a little history of the place, and cut the suckling pig with a plate, Segovia style."
"They even allowed me to cut the second one, and throw the plate on the floor!"
"I asked if I could videotape them cooking the pigs in the kitchen, and they happily obliged."
"I recommend eating here at least once, go ahead and splurge!"
"For your other meals, go find a cheap cafeteria."
"Also, the meat from the cochinillo is VERY flavorful and is quite strong, best to take it easy and not overdo it."
"I agree that the Pizzas here are the best in Moraira and its a lovely little restaurant, but the last time we went in there (january 2009) we had to leave before ordering because it was just too smokey."
They really need to get some decent air extraction or separate the smokers
I was there in Aug 2008.
"We had some tapas, including potatoes with Catalan Sauce and some bread with garlic and tomatoes, as well as the traditional potatoe and egg speciality, which is cut like a piece of cake...and then we had grilled chicken with french fries as well as a salad with feta, tomates and olives."
"We were actually quite hungry when we got there, but tell you the truth left stuffed enough for an August lunch."
"I do wish they had put more french fries in our portions, but overall it was a tasty meal."
Check out the pics for more details on what we had.
Largish sushi restaurant trying for a downbeat atmosphere rather than traditional japanese.
Almost trying too hard with management seeming to concentrate on image rather than quality.
Strong emphasis on salmon and tuna with some exotic variations.
Generally quality is okay but nothing special.
'Specials' sound exciting but in reality seem to fall flat.
Service was not up to the standard of the decor.
The price was average.
Would not recommend for sushi or as place for a drink.
A little more expensive than the norm on the Arenal.
but it's worth it.
The food and service is very good.
Tapas at lunchtime is very good value.
"After reading all of the TA reviews, we felt compelled to go."
"It was terribly disappointing, however."
Tourists at every other table.
lacked the ambiance -- and deliciousness -- of other restaurants and tapas places we went to.
The food was OK. neither delicious nor terrible.
Just nothing notable about it.
A really lovely restaurant in a walled garden on the water front.
Now the traffic has been diverted this is a great quiet place with a great view and the occasional tram passing adds something.
"Good service - really nice food and wine, no too cheap but good value."
Would go again
we were walking round el born of a morning looking for a good coffee.
got to the market.
"had a (great) coffee, wandered round the stalls and saw this restaurant lurking at the back."
we vowed to come back at lunch.
lucky we got there at one as it was packed by two.
"it was everything i dream of finding in a city: attached to the market where you can buy a sheep's head as well as an emu egg, world cuisine not fusion and each dish cooked by an expert, fresh and delicious ingredients, a very trendy vibe, open, clean, cool, welcoming."
"it could have been california (and i loved this aspect too) except that, well...dare i say it everything just had that extra freshness and taste which meant it came directly from the growers or the fisherfolk and was linked up to an ancient tradition of growing and farming but with a modern fresh twist....one of the highlights of a very enjoyable stay and certainly somewhere to go if you're tired of tinned food and oil!"
we did try the paella.
what a disaster.
the rice was burned.
"sticked to the pan a handfull of rice, 2 mussels, 2 shrimps and 1 langustine for 15 euro´s pp."
this nearly theft
After reading reviews of this restaruant on trip advisor we decided to try it whilst in Barcelona over the new year Its isnt situated in any of the main tourist areas and we appeared to be the only tourists in that evening.
On arrival the host in Spanish asked if we would like a drink whilst we waited for our table.Luckily I recognised the word bebida and could reply Si..When we accepted he took us over to his wine casks and left us to drink at our leisure very nice.We finally sat to eat and luckily there was an english menu for backup.
Food was average nothing special but price reflected this.
Watch out for the rabbit.The full rabbit comes looking like it has just been put through a shredder.
Brain Liver testicals the lot
"really impressed, was in group of 10 & came upon by chance with no reservation."
place was empty & thought we'd have no problem getting in but was told we were lucky we were early (9.30pm) !!
all had a cocktail while waiting on our table to be set up from a gr8 menu.
"our starters varied from mushroom soup, sauteed veg, carbonara, pizza, clam pasta & we were all very happy."
"i had lamb for mains & was absolutely fab, everyone was more than impressed."
"MUST leave room for desert, the puff pastry with pecan cream & choc sauce TO DIE FOR even for a non desert person !!"
"ambience was really good, it was packed by 11pm with a DJ playing subtle music in the background."
decor was cool chic.
"price was unbelievable working out at around €360 totalfor cocktails, 7 bottles of wine, 3 courses & coffees."
well worth a visit but do book in advance
We went on a recommendation from our hotel manager elsewhere in Spain - big mistake.
Should've left when we got the menu in 5 languages and saw the place was filled with tourists.
Dire food (REALLY bad!
"), tired setting, average service, VERY expensive."
Don't waste your time and money here when there are so many other fantastic places to eat in Barcelona.
(note - this restaurant also listed as 7 Portes - read those reviews too!)

A pretty average tapas restaurant.
Service is uneven and food is Ok. Quite noisy too but this is a style thing.
We were one of the two tables in use in a fairly large room when we ate at the restaurant in December 2008.
Since we left the restaurant at about 23.00 other customers should have been there by then if they were coming.
We saw nobody else in the other parts of the restaurant.
Service was good because they had a large staff for very few patrons.
The food was unremarkable.
"It was not bad, but it was not good enough to bring us back to the restaurant."
A wonderful place full of flair to enjoy cherry in all its types
This was the only restaurant in central Madrid where we were prepared to pay the price of a la carte.
A very good and interesting set of choices.
"OK the service was a bit rushed, but if you're one of the people waiting for a table that's a plus!"
"I'd recommend this place, and I can't say that for anywhere else we ate in Madrid."
Genial!
"went here on feb 19th, booked a table for 8.30, when we arrived it was chaos and they seemed disorganised, took them nearly 15 minutes to seat us."
Starters and mains very ordinary but expensive.
"Epos system was an antique, if there hadn't been so many waiters it would have been very inefficient."
"Paid 96 euro for average 3 course meal for 2 with 1/2 bottle wine, then had to go on a long journey downstairs to pay by credit card."
The place has character and that's what you are paying for.
"Don't go unless the firm's paying, a lot of corporates in the night we were there."
Definitely not for couples.
We went here on the recommendation of the hotel staff after having a particularly disappointing meal in Can Majo.
"We had 2 courses, paella for me with loads of chicken and seafood and a Hake dish for my husband."
Dessert was the delicious Catalan creme brulee and a lemon sorbet which wasn't too sweet all washed down with a bottle of Cava and some still water.
The food was expensive but very tasty and the portion size was just nice and although there were tourists in the restaurant there were a considerable number of Spanish enjoying a meal too.
We particularly liked the atmosphere in the place and the fact that when you enter the restaurant you have to go past the bar and through the open kitchen to get to a table.
It was busy and yet it was like eating in someone's home because of all the nooks and crannies in the building.
If some people think it's a tourist trap because it's just off La Rambla then we were well and truly caught but have no complaints whatsoever.
It certainly looked nice and welcoming from the outside.
"I was staying nearby and it was one of many options in the neighborhood, but I chose dinner there because it looked like a quiet place."
"Walking in the empty restaurant early and without a reservation, the hostess insisted that the only available tables are the ones in front of the bar."
"Didn't bother me at first, until I realized that in the middle of these tables is the bathroom entrance."
"And the smell was unmistakable every time the door opened, which unfortunately didn't happen until the first course was served, by which time it was too late to just get up and leave."
"As I ordered chicken teriyaki, I asked to substitute brown rice for the white rice that came with it."
"No can do, the waitress said."
How about if I pay the difference?
"I pointed out that the two types of rice are listed separately on the menu, and the difference is 1 Euro."
She wouldn't go for that either.
So I had to pay the full 3.5 Euros for a side of brown rice.
"The chicken was dry and swimming in a deep, thick teriyaki sauce."
At least the rice was good.
"And throughout the experience, my lungs were suffering."
This is a smokers' paradise.
"Not only did almost every customer that walked in almost immediately started smoking, but even the waiters smoked while walking around."
I couldn't wait to finish and get out (and the restaurant was still 80% empty)
Can Frai has an excellent kitchen and service.
The personal is focused on the wishes of the guests and thier wishes.
"The kitchen is excellent and serves fresh food, well prepared."
I'll recommend everyone in Barcelona / Badelona to visited Can Frai.
The food and service is excellent.
Having read reviews here and in a 2007 guide book this place came as a bit of a shock.
Not that it's bad but it was not the experience we were expecting - obviously been taken over and is now quite 'posh' and a bit stiff.
The paella and rice dishes are still the speciality and the one we had was excellent but this is now more a place for men in suits and the staff were very cool and bit unhelpful.
We had read about a wine called Turbio which you are supposed to have with the paella but when we asked for it they said they had never heard of it or served it.
"Overall we were disappointed as we were expecting a real atmospheric Spanish gem, not bad value for money though."
We find this restaurant on this web site and chose this because was near our place.
Now we are happy for this choice.
"Now we just return from ""El Foro"" restaurant."
The food was good.
We was 4 persons and every one take different type.
The service was nice to.
We recommend this restaurant if you come in Barcelona.
When near the Picasso Museum this restaurant represents a good option for lunch.
"The ambience is cosy with a spacious interior decorated in brightly coloured colours, suggesting a hint of Buenos Aires."
The steak or churrasco are highly recommended.
The service was friendly and prompt.
I thought the price very reasonable for the quality of the meal.
"we have eaten there several times, always with enjoyment."
"On one occasion, when my birthday was mentioned, we were treated to a free bottle of bubbly."
The food is freshly cooked and fresh vegetables prevail - quite unusual!
"Chips are not the mainstay of the meal, again unusual."
I'm not even sure they do chips!
The fish is always very fresh and beatifully cooked.
The staff are friendly and helpful.
"There are two Sevillanos, the one in the main part of town being the best in our opinion."
This chocolate shop is INCREDIBLE!
"They have chocolates with the most intriguing flavors, like parmesan cheese and olives."
It is really worth a visit to in Barcelona.
"Make sure to enjoy coffee at their coffee shop at the back of the store, with some chocolates!"
We've eaten many times at Boccalino.
"They have a varied cuisine, with an excellent daily menu."
It now has pretty decor.
"Great pizzas, but even more interesting things on the menu like their roasted artichokes and ""cargols a la llauna"" (snails)."
"The restuarant caught my eye today as i was walking down Rambla de Cataluña and i could,nt believe what i was seeing so went straight over to have a look!"
Great idea!
"and making me feel more at home even though i,ve spent 15 years in Barcelona and speak the local lingos."
"I,m a ""white"" African (and by the way we,re not all racist) and pleased to see images of old & positively new African feel together."
Thumbs up!
"This is definitely a place worth checking out, after a day of sightseeing or shopping."
They have a nice variety of cocktails and beers!
Watch out for the doorman who claims to be anything but himself.
You will have to go looking for Rodeo but it's well worth it.
"Set price 18E for extensive salad bar and non-stop meat served to the table (lots of steak, sausage, pork, amazing black pudding, chicken, ribs - just say yes to whatever you like the look of)."
Finding it is the hard bit.
It's just the other side of the motorway in between the pedestrian bridge above Del Duque area and the grand sur shopping centre/cinema.
Round white building.
Not a romantic atmosphere but lively and fun - we went twice in 2 weeks!
I was so hungry and couldn't walk any more.
"So on the Rambla I saw a sign ""tres tapas y paella+bebida - 11,50 euros"" and came in."
"I should have seen the sign next to it saying ""we speak English"" - a clear ""stay away"" sign."
"When I sat at the table and looked around, I saw only American tourist."
"That's bad, I thought, but maybe the food is okay."
"Well, it was my worst lunch in Spain ever (and this was my third visit to Spain)!!!"
The waiters knew English better than Spanish.
"I had to choose my drink between sangria (tourists), Pepsi (yuck!)"
and everything else - all soda drinks (which I hate).
"Then, after 15 minutes of waiting (which is not unusual in Spain, yet very annoying) I got my so called ""tapas""."
Oh dear G-d!
"One of them was ""ensalada rusa"" - a potato salad with mayonnaise right from the box."
Disgusting.
"Second ""tapa"" -one poor little croquette in a puddle of overcooked oil."
"Third ""tapa"" - ""patatas bravas"" - normally these are potatoes with paprika."
"The restaurant doesn't bother that much - they just put some ready bottled sauce (probably ""1000 islands"", I didn't even want to try those potatoes)."
"And then came the ""paella""."
Actually that was a thin layer of rice on a paella pan.
"The color wasn't yellow as it was supposed to be (you wouldn't expect the restaurant to put precious pricey zaffran in it, they assume that tourists won't know the difference anyway)."
There were two little prawns and two clams and some unrecognizable meat or fish in it.
"On top of it, the so called ""paella"" was too salty."
I was so mad.
"The worst way to spend 11,50 euros."
The strange thing was that the Americans around me kept saying that the food was great.
"I hate to think what they have tasted so far in Barcelona, that they actually liked the food in this awful restaurant."
Please avoid this restaurant.
Look for a place where you can see the locals.
"Be very afraid of places with English menu, I mean it!"
We have been visiting Madrid for 3-4 years for both business and pleasure and our visits are not complete without at least one visit here.
"Yes, it's situated on the Gran Via in the middle of the theatres but it is far from being an overpriced tourist spot."
Definately more of a local - we've always stayed downstairs in the bar/bistro/cafe part rather than wander upstairs to the restaurant.
Looking through the door it maybe doesn't seem that spectacular or even inviting but get in anyway.
We speak very little Spanish and the staff aren't too great on foreign languages but that doesn't seem to stop communication.
Everyone is friendly and will try to explain what the various bits of seafood are - at least two were first time experiences for us here.
Go in for a drink (cheap) and you will get some sort of lucky dip tapas.
The (sea)food is excellent value.
The parillada is a small feast but be prepared to get your fingers dirty.
The oysters(European) are always fresh and cheap (at the time of writing 10euro for a dozen).
If in Madrid you must stop by.
"Outstanding food, service, price."
"It was so good, we went there twice in under a week."
"The food is incredible, and the wait staff are beyond nice."
"It seems slightly out of the way, but it is definitely worth the taxi ride to get there."
La Frasquita is as basic as it gets.
Plastic tables and chairs but -boy- what a view and such great food.
The owner comes over with a tray filled with the catch of the day.
Make your choice or have a mix of all the fish.
It is without a doubt the best fishrestaurant on the islands and definately worth a visit even if you are not staying in Calleta de Fusta.
This is the best restaurant in Mijas Pueblo and Fuengirola in my opinion.
We were playing golf in Jerez and left one night early and stayed our last night in Mijas just to be able to go to El Capricho and eat our last night in spain.
I´v e been there several times and Their gambas a ajillo is the best i´ve had in spain and the family is so humble and willing to give good service.
Greger Henriksson Sweden
"This is a very small and very very busy tapas bar recommended to us by our hotel , we choose to sit at the outdoor tables accross the road ( in the cold)as the inside was far to busy, standing room only."
Food was very good especially prawn kebabs and chicken croquettes.
Location is just 2 minutes from catuluyan main square   We had 5 tapas dishes and 2 beers for 35 euros
Before going to Barcelona I researched Tripadvisor and had a list of restaurants to try out.
One of those was Cerveceria Catalana and after settling into our room in our hotel we went to the reception to ask for directions.
The reception staff advised that being so late it might be difficult to get in on that night but recommended a sister restaurant called Ciutat Comtal.
This place was fantastic.
Yes we had to wait for a table but the atmosphere was brilliant.
"We had an excellent waiter called Toni who forgave our inability to speak Spanish, recommended several Tapas to try and most importantly told us when we had ordered enough."
We tried and can recommend the following -  patatas bravas - little cubes of fried potato covered in a mayonaisse and spicy tomato sauce (1 portion) Wafer thin Serrano ham which came with bits of a thin baguette rubbed with tomato and garlic (1 portion) Veal fillet on a piece of baguette with a not too hot cooked green chilli on top (1 each) Prawn skewers (1 each) Chicken croquettes which had the softest flavourfull filling ever (1 each) Chargrilled baby leeks served with a Romesco sauce.
We were eating them as they were served when a Spanish customer next to us told us you were supposed to remove the chargrilled outer layer.
The difference in flavour and texture when we did this was amazing.
(1 portion) Whilst eating the meal we saw others being served baby clams which were in a garlic sauce and looked absolutely gorgeous and others eating what looked like stuffed red peppers.
We followed with 1 Crema Catalana and a light cake dessert which also had some caramel flavouring on top.
Along with a bottle of Spanish white wine the total bill was €52.
This was one of the cheapest meals we had and one of the nicest.
El Golfo is a very small and remote coastal village on the west coast of Lanzarote.
It has a number of fish restaurants along its waterfront.
"We went to the Mar Azul, which has a small balcony as well as an open terrace across the road right by the beach."
We were offered only a limited choice because the restaurant serves only the fish it has bought fresh that day.
"We ordered deep-fried baby squid and prawns in garlic to start, which were outstanding."
For our main course we had a wonderful mix of freshly grilled whole fish which were simply served with local sauces and bread.
"We also had a jug of local white wine, which went very well with the food."
"The views were also spectacular, with almost uninterrupted views of the rugged coastline."
"Inevitably, the bill was quite high, but the setting and the food were also exceptional."
This place came well recommended by our guide book and hotel and certainly lived up to its reputation.
We got there early (7pm) and got the last table.
They have both spanish and english menus and i think we would have been a bit lost without the second.
"We ordered about 5 dishes (potatoes with tomato sauce and mayo, cuttlefish, clams in garlic oil, baguette style bread and spanish omelette) and all were great."
The bread is a must ...... rubbed with tomato and olive oil and super crusty.
If you like what is at the table next to you just point and the waiter will tell you what it is.
The specials of the day are not in English so we just asked the waiter to recommend one.
The Sangria was a great hit too.
As we were leaving there was quite a long queue starting to form so I'd recommend an early sititng if u don't want to wait.
A must for any visit to Barcelona ... we'll definitely be back!
We have been going to Tossa for 5 years now.
We discovered Bar Lluis 3 years ago.
The food is excellent and the staff/owners so friendly.
We visit this Restaurant very regularly when we stay.
The food is always freshly prepared.
It has a very traditional atmosphere.
Tossas best kept secret.
!!
Highly recommend it.
Tossa is also a wonderful place.
Enjoy.
"Rita & Steven Murray Ormskirk, Lancashire, England"
Over the years we've eaten here on many occasions and we've never been disappointed.
I don't eat meat but there's always lots of choice.
Our Spanish friends eat here regularly and they are very fussy eaters.
The tapas are great but so are the montaditos especially the prawns.
"If you're not sure about ordering just ask for a selection of tapas and montaditos with meat, fish and vegetables."
It gets busy because it's a great restaurant in a city centre and it's popular with residents as well as tourists.
If you want to avoid the queues then you have to get there early.
I had dinner here tonite and must say it was a wonderful surprise.
I was dining solo and did not want to venture far.
"On the recommendation of the hotel, I visited this restaurant."
What a wonderful discovery!
I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back again before I leave Barcelona!
The restaurant is small - only about 10 tables.
So the setting is quite intimate.
It would be a lovely spot for couples.
"That being said, I was solo -- but still did not feel out of place."
The Service was just fantastic!
My waiter was so attentive.
He even asked what music I wanted to hear and found some of the requests to play via his laptop (connected to the restaurant speaker system).
"I was practicing my Spanish and he was very helpful - altho he spoke perfect English as well (I observed him waiting on a couple of Brits at the nearby table....) On his recommendation, I had the fresh salmon."
So fresh it was practically jumping off my plate.
It was just delicious and had a nice side of fresh veggies with potatoes.
All was very well prepared - not overdone...just perfect.
"For dessert, I had the chocolate torte."
YUM!
Served with a small scoup of ice cream.
The waiter laughed at me when I asked for saccharine -- since I had no problem eating all the sweet dessert.
:) I cannot imagine this sort of service and this wonderful food for such a great price.
I paid 40 euros for a 3 course meal with multiple glasses of cava.
plus coffee... and the service was as if I was the only guest in the restaurant.
La Taula is located in a small street (more like an alley in the USA).
Just off of Carrere Muntaner.
I stayed at the Catalonia Suite Hotel and it took me only 3 minutes to walk there -- so have the taxi drop you off at the hotel.
Fantastic food and great value.
"We had the 3-course meal for 17.95 Euros, which included appetizer, main, and dessert."
"Bread, wine, and coffee included!"
The John Dory fish was yummy.
"Waiter was quite rude (reminded me of the soup Nazi on ""Seinfeld""), but if you ignore him, you'll have a great time."
The bus boys are actually nice.
Three course meal for two with a litre of house white cost 38 euro.
You can't complain.
Our waitress was lovely.
"It's busy here, probably because of the good value for money."
"The food wasn't michelin star...but then again we went to another restaurant in Barcelona, very plush, good service but paid 26 euro each for a steak and 5 crisps!!!"
Therefore this restaurant wins hands down.
"Good location in the the hub of the city, just off the Ramblas."
"The tapas here were ok, but there are so many better places on Las Ramblas."
We went in about 8 pm and ordered a seafood paella right away and then ordered some tapas.
"The tapas were ok, not bad but not great."
We waited over 45 minutes for our paella and when it finally came it was the wrong kind.
We were in a rush at that point because we wanted to see the 9 pm futbol match.
We thought we would have plenty of time!
We told the staff about the problem and he went into the kitchen and brought out a seafood paella that wasn't cooked all the way!
"After two bites we then found a long black hair, and were done!"
(my boyfriends hair is short and mine is blonde) When we informed the waiter he looked at us like we did and then examined the hair!!
After a few minutes he simply said that there were no females working in the kitchen.
We got up and left and will not be back!
"this place is quaint, and every table was already full at 7.15pm, which is so unusual for Spain."
The food was all excellent.
The dining is covered outside and beautiful.
It is so inexpensive and if it wouldn't have been our last night we would have ate there again
I have eaten at this restaurant approximately 6 times in the last two years - not once have I had a bad meal there!!
"It is not the cheapest restaurant, nor the largest quantities, but if you appreciate good quality food and are willing to pay a little extra for it, then this is a safe bet!"
"My favourite dishes are the pasta dishes, and I like that you get a little appetizer before your starter, nice wine selection too."
We were given a flyer for the restaurant whilst queuing to get into another restaurant.
"We don't normally act on these, but as it was (literally) just around the corner we thought we'd check it out."
It's at the end of a nondescript alleyway which almost put us off - but we're really glad it didn't.
"After having 'enjoyed' about a week of mediocre food in Spain, at last we had really, really good food."
"It looked as if the place hadn't been open too long, and there weren't too many people there when we arrived, but it really started to fill up around 22h00."
One of the best meals we've had in a long time and not overly expensive.
My wife and I (early 30's) had a great time watching the Flamenco dancers here.
The food and service was also good - better than expected for a restaurant/show combo.
Reservations are recommended.
"If you go to Madrid, this is a must do."
It is a good value as well.
"I first visited this bar and restaurant over 30 years ago, and was the main reason for holidaying in Benidorm too many times to count."
"Paul, Phil and Barbara always made me welcome, as they do with everybody, it was like visiting family."
"Fantastic mwlt in the mouth steaks cooked to perfection by masterchef Philip Worrall, and then sat until the early hours with the family and other customers, listening to music and putting the world to rights."
Heaven.
"Awful Meal, even worse service, lots more far superior Restaurants in La Caleta Del Duque"
We found it to be over-rated with extremely indifferent service.
The nearby La Vieja was streets ahead for both food and service.
25 February 2009
"Great place, lively ambience and high quality tapas, some with a modern touch."
Peruano aceptable
"Beautifully renovated, modern, attentive staff and wonderful food and wine."
LOVE the wine rack display on the walls.
"A must visit when in Gava, Castelldefels or Barcelona!"
Talented young chef Alfonso Moldes and his family have created a nearly perfect restaurant in Tia Brigida.
"Situated in the old seaside village of Cangas, across the picturesque harbor from Vigo, this restaurant specializes in contemporary interpretations of traditional seafood dishes."
"Serving some of the most satisfying food in Galicia, Chef Moldes cooks with his heart as well as his head."
"Based on the 7+ meals I’ve eaten there, I recommend starting out with the sumptuous octopus salad, laid out on sliced pear tomatoes and topped with feta, rosemary, paprika and vinaigrette dressing."
"For a main course, I like the hearty Haddock casserole – based on an old family recipe – which includes prawns, clams, mussels, asparagus, and peas."
"Other my main course favorites include the grilled Galician sea bass or the “King” seafood rice casserole that combines King scallops, King prawns, crawfish, mussels, clams with seaweed, garlic, and saffron in a special caldo."
"I wouldn’t leave Tia Brigida without trying its acclaimed Devil’s food cake, crafted with dark Belgium chocolate, heavy whipped cream, and Earl Grey tea."
Other dessert creations from Mr. Moldes’ kitchen range from a perfect Spanish flan to delicious rum raisin apple pie to warm ginger cookies (with bits of real ginger).
"Mirroring this synthesis of old and new, the restaurant is located in a modernized Galician stone house, once the long-time home of a neighbor figure named Aunt Bridget."
"The ambience is clean, contemporary and tasteful."
A modern upper structure rises out of ancient Galician stonewalls.
Large windowpanes let the sunlight cascade through a glass floor to help illuminate the lower levels.
"The cozy, street-level bar serves good regional beers and Albariño wines, along with house-made seafood empanadas."
"The Moldes family certainly knows fish: one brother is a fisherman, the sister works at the local fish market and the mom is the shrewd, demanding buyer of anything that swims."
"Committed to a great dining experience, another brother oversees the service at the restaurant, ensuring that the staff is both professional and friendly."
This place truly is a family affair.
"Opened in the winter of 2008, this restaurant has quickly become a local foodie favorite, so make reservations in advance."
Prices are moderate.
"For me, Tia Brigida is the perfect place to enjoy a meal with friends or family at a relaxed pace."
"Visiting Galicia, from San Francisco, over many meals, I feel at home in this special restaurant."
Lively place filled with Spaniards.
The food was delicious.
The crowd exuberant at all hours.
We went twice in three days.
AlFresco is delightful.
"From the service to tasty food, it is a gem."
"Anyone looking to be in a no frills atmosphere surrounded by locals, should head up the picturesque ally to this special spot."
"My friends and i have been using this restaurant for a few years, last year ( May ) we visited it and could not believe how the place had deteriorated."
We complained about our meal ( all 3 of us) but the staff did not seem interested.
One of our party ordered spagetti bolegnese and it was just a plate of mush.
We will take our custom and our money somewhere else this year.
"This restaurant was recommend by our hotel , it is in a great location just off Portal de L'angel main shopping street, 2 mins from catulanya square."
"The food was excellent , meat canelloni for starter was gorgeous , roast lamb leg with mash and veg for mains and then most amazing 100% chocolate dessert."
"The service was very attentive , maybe a little to much so ,( it was a sunday evening and the restaurant was only half full hence waiters seemed to watch you closely) Atmosphere was very good especially when piana player was playing."
"The only downside was that the total bill came to 130 Euros for 2 people , which at the current exchange rate is £120 ,( a little expensive for 3 course meal with 2 glasses of wine each)"
The best part of Els Quatre Gats is the atmosphere and soaking in the experience of dining where so many famous people have done before.
"If you are looking for 5 star cuisine and snobby service, this is NOT the place for you!"
The food has always been good (consistent) and the service is good considering how busy it gets.
The boisterous atmosphere and the piano player make the dining experience even better!
I have dined in many restaurants in Barcelona and I ALWAYS look forward to taking friends to Els Quatre Gats!
Delicious lam
This was by far the worst and overly priced noodle house I've ever been.
"First of all, let me tell you about my background, I am an Asian American studying abroad in Spain."
"After a few weeks of Spainish food, my Japanese friend and I were craving noodle soup."
"We stumbled upon this posh, zen, futuristic looking restaurant called ""Udon."""
"Unfortunately, the good part ends here."
"Although the service and atmosphere is lovely, the food was awful."
We ordered a miso ramen and a beef ramen.
"When the food came, we were dissapointed."
"Basically, the ramen was instant noodles and the broth was the msg-powdered stuff."
Not even the good kind of packaged ramen!
"And at 9.75 euros for each dish, this place is a RIP off."
"Seriously, the ramen tasted like the Maruchuan ramen you can buy in the stores in states for 25 cents."
All this restaurant did was add fresh veggies and meat.
"I have to say though, bravo to Udon for using marketing ploys to trick us into trying this place."
"On the menu, it states that this restaurant was modeled after a famous 300 year old noodle place in Japan."
HA!
"If they mean that the noodles were actually 300 years old, THEN I'd believe it."
"Utterly, disgusting... Needless to say, Udon did not satisfy our noodle soup craving and we are still in search for our noodle soup place in Spain."
"This place not only has, in my taste, the best pizza in Madrid but also one of the highest food quality / price ratio."
The owner makes all the difference!
"If you are lucky, you might even have some opera sang to you while you drink the delicious 9 € italian wine the owner proposes."
The simple and stylish black decoration also enchanted me.
A absolute reference!
I went to Casa Roberto's just the other night.
I had to make reservations and they also advised that it was necessary for me to pre-order.
I chose Paella Valenciana and it was great.
It had chicken and rabbit and also snails.
The service was excellent.
Very yummy.
Prices get up there with paella costing about 17+ Euros per person.
They also have a bread service charge of $1.50 Euros per person so if you don't want the bread or the extra charge keep this in mind.
Stayed in Puerto Rico from 7th to the 14th of Feb 09 Minanas - Excellent food!
In hindsight I wish we hadn't eaten anywhere else.
"We had read a few good ratings on this restaurant on trip advisor before we went, so we were planning on giving it a go anyway."
Our hotel was directly above it (Castillo del Sol) What a hidden gem!
After you have looked around the Puerto Rico you will start to notice fairly quickly that all the menus are pretty much identical and all having a front man to try and intice you in (Pull you in at times!)
Minanas needs no front man and the menu is definately a breathe of fresh air.
Peter gives you a warm welcome from behind the bar.
"As soon as you walk in, you know this restaurant is different."
The mood is relaxed and Peter is honestly charming.
"There is an early bird three course meal every evening which is a real bargain and a chef's special set price meal if you choose to eat a bit later, as well as an amazing menu."
"Peter and Juan, (The Chef) own Minanas .You know the food is gonna be great if the boss is cooking!"
The locals eat here too.
"Which is another tell, tell sign that its the best around."
Cant say enough good things about this place.
Learn from our mistakes.
"Eat here the first night of your holiday, if you enjoy it, dont bother going elsewhere."
We were only there for a week and had a couple of nights where we thought we would try somewhere different - Why did we bother.
"If you find a restaurant this good, anything else will be a disappointment in comparison!"
Peter and Juan - Look forward to hopefully seeing you both in July.
"Love, Kerry and Bill"
At nine o’clock on New Years Eve my dining partner and I entered Vagabonds restaurant in Benidorm.
It was the start of a very memorable evening.
We were greeted by Frederic who introduced us to Marie.
Vagabonds is an intimate restaurant with only a handful of tables and Frederic and Marie do everything.
"We started with complimentary canapés, followed by salads which were beautifully presented and very tasty."
For main courses we chose pork fillet in strawberry sauce and lamb cutlets in mint sauce.
There were some very exotic sauces to choose from.
We were very pleased with our choice.
Also the potato dauphinoise was perfect.
"Pudding time next and we chose ice cream and whisky cake, as a man on the next table was in raptures over it, and Frederic’s version of crème caramel."
Both were absolutely gorgeous.
We then had a liqueur to finish.
"This was all chosen from the set dinner, 3 courses for €14.99 menu."
Proper restaurant food at this price.
"The best was yet to come, as we were the last customers to leave so we had Marie and Frederic to ourselves for half and hour or so."
These people are so interesting and entertaining we had to tear ourselves away or we would have missed the New Year fireworks.
I recommend Vagabonds to all who enjoy lovely food and really good hosts.
We were made very welcome and wouldn’t dream of going to Benidorm without paying a visit.
A truly memorable evening.
Thanks again Marie and Frederic.

This quickly became a favourite in a recent visit to Nerja.
It is usually busy and with plenty of locals as well as tourists.
The food is varied with classics as well as typical Italian dishes.
"Unpretentious but well cooked, tasty and freshly produced ."
"Service was always prompt, pleasant and helpful."
If you are lucky enough to get a table on the balcony the view 's good but its a pleasant place even further back.
Prices are sensible - not the cheapest but considerably better quality than several other Nerja restaurants of similar cost.
Defintely worth a try if you are in the area.
"We were staying in Tenerife for only one week, and wanted somewhere to go for Valentines Evening."
"As we are in the older age group we chose the Garibaldi as it was only a short walk from our Hotel, and looked elegant from the outside."
"We found the staff very attentive, and helpful."
The menu has something to suit everyone.
"The is a piano player, with a great electronic accompaniment, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant, with a good mixture of age groups eating there."
"There is a little enclosed courtyard, half in, and half out, where one can eat, or inside if it is chilly."
We liked it so much we went back again on our last evening.
"Visited late December expecting a very Spanish ambience, but was like a 'Little England', both staff and clientele."
"However, the service was very good, food, nothing very exciting."
The chipped tureen containing vegetables shows lack of attention to detail.
There are other more authentic Spanish restaurants in this area.
"Situated in an old farm house in the hills above BCN, this is a cut above the standard neighborhood restaurant that I found in the center city."
"Food, service and ambiance were all excellent and fairly well priced."
The presence of locals and absence of toursits suggested it was a notch above other well advertised restaurants.
My only complaint was that the 8 pm reservation was not honored even though it was in the reservation book for the correct time.
"It appeared that a large party delayed the restaurant from opening at its published time, and there was no attempt to notify me."
So yummy tapas place...We kept going back.
Mixed with locals and always a good sign.
It was very busy always.
But the did a great and fast job.
Went here last year and before in 2006.
We tried our best to eat here every other night.
We couldnt stay away from the place..great steaks!!
"Friendly enough waiters, can get very busy and advisable to book a table at all times."
Heading back to Santa Ponsa May of this year for a birthday week and hope to eat here again and again.
Simply sensational.
One of the best meals of the last decade.
"I had the tasting menu, and each dish flowed beautifully into the next, with superb plating and exceptional service complementing the outstanding fusion of subtle flavours."
"I was extremely fortunate in that the restaurant had a last-minute cancellation, as my hotel only rang at 10:00pm!"
"Chef Pellicer was extremely gracious as I was introduced to him in the kitchen, and he can around at the end of the meal and chatted with me for about 10 minutes."
"Seafood was the main component of the meal (naturally, in Barcelona), but the lightness and elegance of each dish impressed me enormously."
"Each plating was also a work of art, and the wine pairings worked beautifully."
It would be a privilege to be able to return sometime.
brunches are fab.
bit pricey but worth it!
"We took:  patatas braves, pan con tamatas, fried anchovies and grilled squid."
I really liked the first three so very good food here!!
"I found the grilled squid somewhat boring, but my boyfriend enjoyed it very well."
Afterward I took a desert: lemon ice with orujo --> VERY VERY GOOD!
!
We found this place while wondering around looking for something to eat.
With Barcelona being so touristy we found it hard to judge the quality of some restaurants but everything looked right about Taller de Tapas.
"Sure enough, the food was excelent, the service friendly prompt and helpful and the selection of wine top notch."
"We ended up going back 3 times during out 5 night stay in the city, having differeint things each time."
"The place is part of a group of bar/restaurants and there are several similar nearby, but the food here seems to be the best."
"It is certainly not a hole in the wall, off the beaten path or local place but that does not mean it is not very good."
The prices are a little high but the food and atmosphere are really good.
You should try the bread with tomatoes appetizer.
We have been attempting to replicate it at home without luck.
Definitely a safe place for people who really know tapas as well as those who are not usually adventurous.
This is a modertly priced restaurant near BCN University.
"It specializes in typical Spanish dishes, all well prepared and modertly priced."
There are a number of combinations available.
The staff is very accomodating and engaging and help with recommendations for other restaurants as well.
The space is small and can be smoke filled at times.
For those of you who dont like you pintox smoked by tabacco the air con is the best in the old town.
As for the food.... AMAZING... one of the BEST... GREAT modern touches from a talented and skilful chef.
We sampled allot of the pintox bars in the old town and it seemed to be the modern ones that delivered the more allround gastronomic expeirnce.
The standard is that of a high end restaurnat having 6 to 8 dishes is just like having a tasting menu at Arzak and Martin Berasategui but far more eaiser on the wallet.
Highly recomended :-)
I had the misfortune of meeting people for lunch at this restaraunt.
"Apart from the place looking modern, that the menu of the day was of typically backward and unimaginative Spaniah/Catalan fare i.e."
"all plates conatined meat and fish , with no thought for people who don't eat meat."
As we were pressed for time and I was the only vegetarian in the group we decided to try our luck and eat there anyway.
The staff were unwelcoming to the fact that one of the four in the group did not eat meat.
The option was to order from the few unbalanced vegetarian offerings on the main menu at a much higher price.
There was no attempt made to accomodate me at all.
"I have to say, I am still annoyed about the Spanish attitude to vegetarianism."
"Foie Gras, which is banned for ethical reasons in some countries is available in this restaraunt."
These restaraunts are typical of the peoblem of Spain in 2009.
It is behind Europe in so many ways.
It at least 20 years behind Ireland and Britain in they way they treat vegetarians in restaraunts like this.
"Sadly they are proud of the fact that their cuisine is rooted the past with no view to the future, without respect for the diet of an increasing minority or the disaster that our excessive meat and fish eating is having on the environment."
I was told that the chef is proud of his traditional offerings.
Good for him.
I am sorry if the tone of this review is political rather than of the food.
"If you eat meat, give this place a try, you will be happy here, as other reviews state."
What was served was fine.
Cataln food is very healthy if lacking in flavour and imagination.
"Naturally I won't be back, there are too many places in Barcelona that don't treat vegetarians as two headed monsters or a threat to a culture that does not want to move with the times."
"If you are eating out and would like more environmentally friendly options, one restaraunt in the same area with a nice twist on mediterrainan food with more imagination is Mama Cafe."
"It has meat, fish and vegetarian options, something for everyone."
Nobody is left out.
First came upon this 8 years ago after they first opened.
A lovingly family affair that has touches of haute cuisine without all the fuss.
The plates are deeply flavored but playful and the attention to detail everywhere.
Some of the portions are a bit small but the taste certainly never is.
Small bar is charming.
Went on a Sunday evening at 8:30 pm and had to wait 30 mins for a stool.
Chatted with others waiting - mixture of locals and tourists that knew of Pep's cuisine.
Sat down at the bar and told them what type of food we liked and didnt like and they suggested a number of dishes.
"Then out they came one after another of amazingly fresh, simple, tasty tapas."
You see it cooked in front of you and think we can do it at home.
"But that would be impossible since we don't have access to the phenomenal local, fresh ingredients and don't have decades of experience in cooking it just right."
So we will have to be content in coming back here for more in the future!
My husband and I were on the hunt for a place to eat in Barceloneta when we found this little restaurant packed with people.
We were seated immediately at a table for two right in front of the kitchen and were happy to see delicious food being churned out quickly.
"The menu is one large laminated page, front and back with a great selection of cold and hot tapas, along with more substantial meals, with a focus on seafood."
"We started ordering whatever we saw coming out of the kitchen that appealed to us (which was a lot) and ordered ""rabas"" which were lightly breaded and fried calamari, ""pinchos"" which was a pork skewer, and the tomato bread."
"Our waiter suggested that we try the house specialty, ""bombas"" and we did!"
They were large potato croquettes with a bit of ground pork inside.
"They were served with two sauces that we are still trying to figure out what they were, but it just complemented them immensely (yellow-hollandasise?"
orange-some sort of hot sauce?).
My husband also had the steak and potato platter and I ordered the beef tendon.
"Yeah, we didn't realize how much food it was, but it was all so good."
We washed it down with some cava and Estrella beer.
Everything was so good.
And the best part?
It was a great value at 35 euros!
"If you're looking for just great food and a causal atmosphere for a good price, you have to stop here."
"If you want a chi-chi place where you can dress up, you'll pay for the ambiance."
We really enjoyed this place and came back two more times for dinner.
This place certainly was one of the highlights of our trip!
It was the best meal I had in Barcelona!
We don't speak a word of Spanish so they put us (five girls) at the bar stool right in front of the chef himself.
He just ordered for us and kept bringing some fantastic tapas to us.
The house wine was excellent.
The only thing he asked us was whether we want more food or not (I think that what he said).
We all love to eat and this is by far one of the best food we had during our Spain trip.
I think the price is very reasonable for the great quality of food we had.
"If you don't want to wait, we went there about 10 min before it opens at 8pm and get right in."
"If you don't, it's a very long wait."
"an absolutely amazing Tapas restaurant with a great wine selection, a very rustic ambiance in a small street of the old town and a very friendly service."
I can't believe that this restaurant hasn't been reviewed before as it's my wife's and I favorite place to eat in Marbella.
"The food is excellent, the service impeccable and the price reasonable considering the quality of the cooking."
Not to be confused with it's sister restaurant on the coast at San Pedro.
I eat here every time I come to Madrid and couldn't recommend it highly enough.
"Carlos, the owner, is a wine expert and will take you through the extensive list."
Last time I was there Carlos recommended Campo Eliseo (Toro) and it remains one of the best wines I've ever had the pleasure of meeting!
"I would describe the food as posh, imaginative tapas, with a strong Catalan influence."
My overwhelming memory of the food in Matritum is 'mouthwatering'.
"Matritum is pricier than standard tapas restaurants, but excellent price-quality relationship."
I agree with the review saying this is a bluff as it is indeed that.
"Although the place is packed and has a good traditional appearance, the food is very expensive for what it is, eg €25 for the disappointing and 'famous' roast suckling pig with a handful of awful chips."
Worst of 4 meals in Madrid and the most expensive by €30-40.
I'd rest easy knowing you haven't missed anything if you don't visit and have two meals elsewhere for the price of one here.
My son and I found this restaurant while on a quest to find the Jardines de Murillo.
This restaurant was a great find.
It has been in business for more than 70 years.
It is a lovely restaurant serving Andalusian specialities.
"The wine list was excellent and its location is great, just the entrance of “Santa Cruz”."
We were extremely pleased with the service and the setting.
High quality products and delicious TARTA DE QUESO.
Lots of atmosphere and a real treat.
Hope to return next time we go to Seville.
We went based on reviews on this site and elsewhere - and we weren't disappointed.
"Great value, great choice, top notch service, fun and friendly."
"This is by far the best chinese food I ever had , cant believe it was in spain,it was a while back since dining here but by the looks of other reviews they are still keeping up the good work."
"If you visit Madrid and a bit crazy with Real Madrid, you gotte try this restaurant, Ramos has his own table at this place...!!"
Great food.
We stumbled across this place and have had a couple of great meals there.
"Menus are diverse, ingredients of excellent quality and overall the restaurant is very good value."
"Decor is dark and modern, but interesting and atmosphere vibrant."
Worth seeking out.
"I was with 3 friends at Don Miguel Restaurant, Ronda, Andaluzia on the 22 nd Feb 09 ."
We saw the splendid location and went there for lunch.There were plenty of empty tables and we were waiting to be seated.
When we ask the supposed maitre were told that the restaurant was completely full reserved and around 100 persons were waiting in the room.
So we decided to go to the cafeteria on the lower floor.
"Service was terrible, food horrible for the price paid- a called chicken salad as a main dish was nothing more than some lettuce leaves with 2 pieces of avocado; but the worse was that we were paying attention to the restaurant -all tables are in a opened air space, and the tables went on empty and there were no 100 people waiting."
It is degusting be treated in such a way.
"This owner is only looking for business- it was a busy day- sunday and most probably had billed already a lot... well ,bed service and would not recomend to anyone, beside i will write to local tourism service...It is really a pity that such a nice town has people receiving  tourists like that... José, Gonzalo, Jorge and Avelino."
I have to agree with all the other reviewers.
This place is excellent.
My girlfriend and I ate there on Saturday night and it was the best meal we had in Barcelona.
Like most people here I recommend the suprise menu.
It adds so much to the enjoyment of it all.
The waiters were excellent and very helpful.
I'm definitely eating there the next time I'm in Barcelona.
It is advisable to book as it is quiet small.
It is also a little off the beaten track so give yourself enough time.
Our Taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong end of the street so it took us a while to find it.
Would I recommend to a friend?
I haven't shut up about it so far.
Went to Con Gracia on Saturday night - had such a fantastic meal that had to write on here.
I'd read reviews about the place but none of them do it justice.
The food was fantastic - we went for the 'Surprise' menu with the surprise wine list to go with it.
Each course was delicious and the wine that was chosen for each course complimented it brilliantly.
The restaurant is not far from Passeig de Gracia and easily accesible using the metro.
"You wouldn't just stumble across this place, you need to know where to go, but it's definitely worth it."
"It's not the cheapest place, but there are no surprises on the bill."
Booking is advisable - it only seats about 20 people.
But the atmosphere is fantastic and you feel as though you are getting really personal service without it being intrusive at all.
"If you want a special, top class meal in Barcelona, make sure you go to Con Gracia"
My wife and I enjoyed a truly wonderful experience at Con Gracia.
Upon arriving we were greeted at the taxi and escourted into the restaurant.
We were made to feel very welcome and treated superbly all evening.
We selected the surprise menu accompanied by the wine tasting.
"Each course was served with it's specially selected wine - the flavour combinations were truly unique, delicious and very memorable."
An expensive evening but very definately worth it for the fantastic food and overall experience.
We would highly recommend this restaurant.
Had a fabulous three course lunch here last week with matched wines and could not have been more pleased.
The restaurant is very small so reservations (particularly for dinner) are a must.
The service was attentive and informative - each item was explained fully in English.
"We selected the ""surprise"" menu and were asked in advance about food allergies or items we preferred to avoid."
We tried to return the following day for dinner but they were booked.
We'll know better next time to reserve in advance and we will be back!
!
"If you compare the quality of the food, a-la-carte fares, the wine selection and calculation as well as the overall service with other competitors such as Port Petit in Cala D'Or, Moli d'en Bou near Manacor, Vall D'Or in Porto Colom - this Restaurant is highly over estimated (over priced) and in my opinion not more than average."
The service is highly unorganized especially when busy or in the beginning/end of every season due to frequently exchanged staff.
You should also read the reviews at the various Mallorcan Dining Guides.
Some of them don't even list the restaurant anymore.
"You can certainly dine at a higher quality, more relaxed and for far less money at their competitors."
And by the way - the views and surroundings are much nicer at Port Petit or the Vall D'Or Golf Course.
We went to La Concha on 2 occasions - both really good.
The very friendly waiter remembered us each time and recommended different dishes to us which we were only too willing to try - the baby pig and the zarazuela.
The fish soup was wonderful and they seemed to have a lot sea food available which looked fabulous.
All other diners were Spanish which is always a good sign.
Our 2nd visit we stayed very late and they made us up an excellent (enormous!)
cheese board and brought us complimentary liquers with it.
"We drank the house wine, a carafe, which was very acceptable and good value for money."
"Shirley Mott Dawson Montreal, Quebec, Canada My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at the Francisco II in Almunecar, Spain while on our honeymoon in October 2007."
In the beginning not being familiar with the area or the country we tried other restaurants but nothing compared to the delicious menu choice at this restaurant.
After being there a day or so we finally got adventurous and found this gem highly recommended by our sister and brother-in-law whose villa we were staying at while there.
"The service and atmosphere was so friendly we felt most welcome, so after that we returned there most days and spent many pleasant afternoons during siesta time, talking with the owners and even when my husband I started out as sole customers the restaurant quickly filled and pretty soon we were engaged in friendly conversation with the other patrons."
This certainly was the real taste of Spain.
We recommend it highly and hope one day to return to this charming place.
I had the pleasure of spending a few days in Almunecar while the locals were celebrating the Catholic feast of Easter (or Semana Santa as they call it in Spain).
"A savvy local recommended Francisco II to us as a good spot to dine, drink - and watch the goings-on."
"And how right he was : the restaurant is only a stones throw from the town square, and having secured one of the outdoor tables we didn't have to move an inch to watch the spectacle, as the festival parade passed right by us - costumes, religious floats, marching bands and all."
"As I read about Almunecar now on tripadvisor and plan a return trip, just thinking of Francisco II brings back memories of the 'real Spain' : large sides of ham curing over the bar, ever-grinning staff bustling between tables with a joke or a smile for everyone, and of course food to die for."
We'll be back!
5th Avenue is down one of the streets leading off the main street in Fuerteventura.
It is run by Scottish/English couple and is very good value.
The menu had some unusual spicey sauces using locally sourced meat and fish.
The food was served piping hot with very generous portions of vegetables.
For the homesick they do traditional Sunday lunch.
The decor is a little tired but the place is very clean and the service is friendly.
Meal for 2 plus bottle of wine cost us 33 euros very good value.
Sally
We tried the Restaurante Alexandre as it was a short walk from the Gran Hotel Solucar where the inhouse restaurant menu was pricey and the dining room lacked atmosphere.
The Restaurante Alexandre is modestly furnished and is a room off a typical local Spanish bar.
The restraurant although empty this evening off season probably does a roaring trade at lunchtime with its menu del dia for workers.
"However, we were very pleasantly served and the actual evening menu looked enticing."
A bit of Spanish would be a help for any diner.
All our dishes were excellent three fish and one meat for the four of us and well prepared.
"Overall, a very pleasant surprise (a hidden gem) and recommended."
We spent a few hours every day in this awesome crepe bar.
"The staff were super-friendly, and they spoke English!"
Great cocktails.
Great service.
Great food.
"We stayed at the Hotel Banys, which was just around the corner."
4 Norwegians had a superb dinner here in November '08
Excellent Sea Food and Meat They prepare a wide range of First Quality dishes Warm and excellent Service
"Whilst staying at the Hotel Bonanova Park, Barcelona (see separate review) we asked at Reception for a good lunchtime venue and were directed to the Si-Chaun restaurant (a couple of blocks away)."
What a find!
We arrived at 2:15 (early-ish for lunch in Spain) and the restaurant was already half full.
By 3:00 it was full with people waiting.
Here's a good sign: half the clients were chinese.
This is a smart restaurant with top class service and great food but here is the best bit.
"The lunchtime Menu del Dia was 7,95 euros!!!"
For a quality meal in nice surroundings in Barcelona.
I still cant believe it.
We started with a soya salad (beansprouts and salad) for my wife and a hot spicy soup for me.
Not the standard soup with red peppers and bits of egg in it but darker and more interesting.
Then chicken curry (I know what you are saying: a curry in a chinese restaurant?
But this was stir fried with many ingredients.
My wife had a whole pork shank (with chips).
The fat had been taken off and the shank glazed.
We had rice and chinese bread which is basically homemade bread that has been fried and glazed (I think!)
The wine was EXCELLENT (a whole bottle for two diners).
It was full bodied and definitely not the 1 or 2 euros stuff from the local supermarket.
Elsewhere I would expect to pay 5 or 10 euros for the wine alone!
"The sweet was the usual flan, helado etc touch but, in fairness, the flan was homemade."
My wife had chinese tea.
All around us chinese clients were ordering plates not on the menu of the day.
"Exquisite meals of dumplings, ribs, etc were being presented to great excitement."
Total cost?
A smidgin under 16 euros for two and a truly memorable meal and an experience to remember for a very long time.
"I cannot comment on the evening prices but if there is any justice in this world, the Si-Chuan should be expensive!"
Five out of five in my book....and I've visited a lot of chinese restaurants in my 22 years in Spain!
A nice spot to sit and have some churros y chocolate.
"We stopped here on an August afternoon and ordered porras, a larger version of churros."
They were cold and hard.
The chocolate was good enough.
"I suppose that it would be better to go here in the morning, when you'll get fresh churros, not ones that have been sitting for an hour."
Fine decor and atmosphere.
Strongly recommended is the veal with a cranberry sauce.
The fish dishes also looked very tasty.
"The service was fine, in fact there was nothing at fault."
A meal for two with deserts and an excellent bottle of wine came to €57.
The Tucan is closed on Mondays.
"Mix entre bar, pub y restaurante."
Agree that restaurant is not up to previous standard of 2/3 years ago.
Basic 'menu of the day' is still reasonable value.
It is certainly a lot quieter than before so people are perhaps voting with their feet.
I wonder whether they have lost a good chef?
"Dined in the upstairs section (Masia del Mar) on 31st Jan '09 & found everything from start to finish awful, bad service, over cooked food, stale bread, had to re-order wine when our main course arrived as they hadn't brought it yet, once we had finished our main course we asked for the bill & left, lots of better alternatives in La Caleta & Del Duque"
"We have been coming to Barcelona for the past few years and have never found a bar that both offers fantastic cocktails (at reasonable prices), amazing food and a brilliant atmosphere, but last year we found one such bar."
Marmalade is a must for any visitor to Barcelona.
"Since finding the bar we have normally been in their every night either for food or drinks, or as is usual, a bit of both."
"The cocktails are to die for especially in the ""happy hours"" of 7pm until 9pm where they have a wide selection available for 4€ each, but even after 9pm they are still only 6€ to 7€ which is still alot cheaper than most places in the city."
The food is excellent and we normally start on the lounge menu and have a couple of sharing dishes.
The crostinis are fantastic and fill a little hole until you decide what to do for dinner.
"For dinner we normally end up staying their and eating in the restaurant and a few of their ""to die for dishes"" are the stuffed artichokes, the lamb with sweet potato and also the homemade brownie with crema catalana ice-cream!!"
YUMMY What also makes this place different from the many other bars we have tried is the staff.
They are always friendly and courteous and make an evening there very enjoyable.
"By the way they also a have sister bar called ""Milk"" in the gothic area...same happy hours but a different yet fantastic menu (try the pitas with mixed dips!)"
Very unfriendly service
"Hubby and I went there with the idea that we would have a couple glasses of wine and a ""few"" pinchos."
"Well, we had 17 toothpicks left at the end of the evening, plus 5 glasses of wine... it was definitely more expensive than eating at a sit-down restaurant."
"But overall, it was a fun experience and the food was tasty."
Took my wife there to tell her I loved her and it didn’t disappoint.
"Lovely food, recommend the Pizza bread starter, wife loved it."
"Staff lovely and just right, not over attentive or pushy, allowing plenty of time to saviour the atmosphere and food."
"Located off the main strip hence may need seeking out, but well worth it"
"I recently revisited this, my favourite, restaurant in Torremolinos and discovered that they now do a menu at 12.50 Euros....Surely the best value for a meal of that calibre in town!"
"It's always hard to choose from the many choices on the set or a la carte menus but , as usual, we found something for everyone: wonderful steaks, salmon, sauces and delicious vegetables (in a country not always noted for vegetarian possibilities!)"
"As usual the chef proprieter manged to take time out of his busy hot kitchen to make us feel welcome and the waiters were, as always, charming and attentive, Whether for an intimate dinner a deux or for a larger party there can be no better place than La Escalera, with its fabulous views over the Med and its warm friendly atmosphere, And good news for smokers too!"
As in so many Spanish Restaurants it is still possible to smoke here (although you are asked to be considerate to other smokers) Viva la Libertad!
My new Fiance and I went here to celebrate our Engagement as it was reccommended to us by our Hotel Concierge as a Romantic and intimate restaurant with good food and service.
We were not disappointed.
The food was top notch.
My fillet steak was cooked to perfection as was my fiance's duck al'orange.
The menu i thought was very good.
Enough choice but not overloaded.
The seating was reasonably intimate and we were tucked away in a nice corner.
The service was EXCELLENT.
Always checking everything was ok. Wine glass never allowed to be empty!!
"The staff were very friendly and helpful, especialy with the wine selection."
"If you want a romantic evening, i would definitely reccommend the Magic Fountains of Montjuic (5mins walk from the restaurant) followed by dinner at this restaurant, or vice versa."
We went for a special birthday dinner and selected the Menu Degustacion.
"The staff were charming and attentive without being intrusive, and made a special effort knowing it was a birthday dinner."
We thoroughly enjoyed the food and presentation was excellent.
"Great ambience, can't recommend it enough."
My wife and I had a spectacular dinner at El Choto (the goat).
"The roasted meats, goat & pork, were suculent & crispy."
Great starters & desserts as well as a terrific wine list.
All made perfect by our charming host & waiter.
"Well, to judge by the reviews here, we were just treated badly, but I'm compelled to tell my story anyway."
I took my son (ten) to dinner at El Choto this evening.
"The staff was friendly, but the food was truly abysmal."
"I ordered the prix fix, and began with the scrambled eggs with beans and iberico ham: the dish came to the table as a mound of foul-smelling beans with traces of egg and small bits of ham."
The beans smelled like rancid dishwater and I explained to the waiter that I could not eat it.
"To his credit, he took it away right away and replaced it with a typical soup, which although heavily oversalted, was edible."
My son's main was duck breast in raspberry sauce.
The duck came so overcooked it looked and tasted like liver.
"We live in France and make magret frequently at home, so my son knows how duck breast looks and tastes."
This was an inedible dish.
"Then to top themselves, my mains came."
This was to be a stuffed filet of salmon topped with a shrimp-based sauce.
"The salmon arrived drenched in a very dark sauce, and when I cut into it, I discovered the stuffing was ice-cold."
"This dish, supposedly prepared fresh by the restaurant, obviously resides in the deep-freeze and then is microwaved, as the exterior of the salmon was cooked, but three millimetres down the flesh was raw and cold and the stuffing was almost frozen."
I sent the dish back explaining the middle was frozen and told the waiter I just wanted the bill.
"Which was brought promptly, for all items ordered; ie, I was charged for my full meal."
What kind of fine establishment serves a dish this poorly prepared and then charges the customer full price for it?
"My Spanish is so rotten, I couldn't argue, rather I paid the bill as one would pay a ransom, and left."
"Perhaps this is a great restaurant on other nights, but nothing I witnessed in El Choto suggested to me that these people have any idea what they're doing."
A disgusting experience.
Excellent service Excellent food Excellent view Probably the best eating experience I've had in barcelona.
"Waiters are friendly, you can almost manage in all English."
"Not that cheap, but for a bottle of cava and a 2 person paella we only dropped about 50 euros here for what is a really great experience."
We decided to go to this restaurant for an evening meal as it had been recommended on tripadvisor.
We arrived at about 8pm and the place was empty but we knew that would change and it did.
However for us it just didn't seem to gain any atmosphere.
We like to try local food when we go abroad and on this occasion we chose the following:- to start - seafood soup and salt cod salad for main - Seafood Fideua for 2 a bottle of cava and still water The charge for this was approx €85 The best part of the meal for us was the soup and the cava.
The salad consisted of raw salt cod covered in olive oil.
It wasn't to our taste but then you don't know that until you try.
The Fideua seems to be the same as Paella only made with vermicelli noodles and although tasty for €27 for the 2 of us there was very little seafood in it and the portion was small.
All in all we found the experience a bit of an expensive let down.
Good value for money !
Especially at lunch time.
I have been to El Chaleco a number of times.
The location at the end of a strip of shops and not terribly attractive.
"However, inside the decor is quite nice."
"The food, while it did not wow me, was good."
The service was very good.
The menu is predominantly French influenced and the restaurant seems to attract a French speaking group.
I have had a hard time finding what I consider healthy choices and the meals I did have were a bit too sauced and heavy for my taste.
This is not a bad choice for change of pace but not a place that I would dine regularly.
I've been last summer with my family on holidays in ogrove.
"O Grove it's a beautiful fishing little town but with a lot of beaches and ambient, so we decided to stay a few more days than expected."
we had rented a house with sea view and a beautiful terrace to eat outside but who wants to cook on holidays??
"no me, im on holidays too!"
and who can afford to eat out three or more meals a days?
we don't.
"but we just found this O'Forno ""Home made food to take away"" oforno its a small family shop,the owner its a very kind galician woman that cooks along with another womans that superb food, it really make you feel like home with her fresh tasty menu and exquisite Empanadas."
"Everything to take away, hot or cold with affordable price."
"Having tried this restauarant on 3 occasions (in case I got it wrong on the first two occasions), I have to say that whilst it is situated in a eviable position, the food is below avearge and I am not that fussy when it comes to quality."
"It is, as you would expect, expensive but you would expect this due to the postion of this restaurant but I can honestly say that the food is not at all memorable."
It is a shame because the service is good and the place IS really smart.
Torre del mirador was the most expensive meal of our holiday but also the most romantic and special.
We shared a seafood paella (36euro) and some wonderful house red wine.
"Excellent service, live music and ambiance."
Would definitely recommend it.
Just head along the Del Duque beach coast path (Caleta direction) and look for the pretty fairly lights.
were in Lanzarote for a week ending 19/2/09.
Went to El Navarro on the first night as it was late and it was just around the corner from our apartment.
Santa Rosa.
We were back for 4 of the nights and the standard of the food was just superb.
the waitress/owner was very pleasant and helpful and I would go back to Lanzarote to eat here.
simple but fantastic tapas
Good Japanese at reasonable price.
Hot spot in Jap food.
"nice place, typical but sitting turned out too expensive - you should stand at the bar and enjoy tapas & canas"
"Actually, the name is ""Memorias de China""."
Best chinese restaurant in BCN.
"Their ""bogavante a la sal y pimienta y especies chinas"" is a real classic!"
I tried the one in Madrid: mejor chocolateria del mundo - me encanta (chocolate caliente..hmm)
Good food at reasonable price.
Nice place to chill out.
Traditional decoration but mediocre food and service.
Just a pizza & pasta place to eat something before going out.
Delicious tapas in a nice setting.
No seating.
"Just average tapas, expensive and tacky place."
Not worth it.
The best Vasc restaurant in the city
A rip off!
Just because it has tapas on the name they rip tourists and locals off.
Ridiculous!
Watch out.
"We recently dined at La Alcazaba, as my husband is a chef we had heard some good things about it."
"Without a doubt it overlooks some of the most stunning views from Mijas, sadly this is the only plus point to this restaurant."
"The restaurant itself is ok, but for a so-called ""Fine Dining"" establishment - the menu was incredibly large & the decor and linen shabby (our napkins all had holes in)."
During the time that we were there we kept hearing this annoying loud buzz - a bit like a game show buzz - which we later worked out to be a signal from the kitchen telling the wait staff that an order was ready for pick up.
"The starters were over-complicated with the pate coming out in 4 blobs on some biscuits, surrounded by orange, kiwi, strawberries, a pot of strawberry jam, hearts of palm, tinned white asparagus, grated carrot, beansprouts & lambs lettuce Wow!"
"We ordered Chateaubriand medium-rare (for 2) for main course - which resluted in it having to be sent back 3 times as they just had no idea how to cook to desired temperature (1st time well-done, 2nd & 3rd Blue!)."
"The maitre'd then had the cheek to ask us ""what do you he expect me to do with the meat now?"""
At which my husband said he really didn't care!
By this time my parents had been served & finished what they could of their main courses (Dover Sole) the fish itself was good but the vegetables looked like they had been sat in the fridge for a week & then re-heated maybe 4 or 5 times.
"After aprox an 11/2 hr of commotion we politely asked for our bill so we could go elsewhere, however the maitre'd would not present it - after asking a further 4 times with no luck, we asked to see the manager."
"My husband spoke to him & he really didn't care about what had happened & we were then presented with our bill, we paid for what we'd had and left."
"La Alcazaba really is stuck in the 1980's & it seems that they are still living off of the repuatation that they had then, from the style of the food, the decor & the staff."
We were there on a Saturday evening (9.00pm) & there were only 12 people including us there.
It truly could be a phenomenal restaurant if it was in the right hands & guided in a more modern direction.
A good restaurant for lunch - situtated near to the Cathedral.
Sea-food always fresh.
We recommend you order a portion of your favourite seafood just boiled and a glass of beer.
They also do a seafood rice which is good.
The tapas bar is always packed with locals - the adjacent dining area is also mostly frequented by locals.
We ate here 3 times during our recent visit we enjoyed it so much.
"Menu outside a bit misleading, has loads of press cuttings with rave reviews displayed, definitely didn't live up to that !"
"Also we went for the early evening menu which is 18.50 for 2 courses but only when you go to pay the bill you seee the small print which says 1.50 per head cover charge and 7% for something else, I can't even remember it was so absurd."
"The service was friendly and fine, the food itself was no better than something i'd cook for a midweek family dinner, very little effort gone into the preperation of the food, it was very amateur cooking."
I went to this bar and had very friendly barmen who suggested a dish of tapas - not thinking to ask the price we then paid for a small dish of gamberetti 20 euros.
Apparently they are supposed to show prices in these bars but they dont.
"No wonder they have photos of actors, politicians etc - they are the only people who can afford or are willing to these prices."
In a recession and being an everyday traveller - dont be fooled by these thieves - dont go there.
This restaurant is situated overlooking the river with a fantastic view over the medieval bridge.You can eat on the outside terrace in the shade of a loquat tree surrounded by the scent of jasmine.
The food was very variable in quality.
"An appetiser of potato leek and courgette soup was very tasty, but was served with a very chewy bread."
The starters my family had were very flavoursome.
"Unfortunately, I chose aubergine, anchovies and peppers on pastry."
The pastry was rock hard and you had to dig your cutlery in so hard to break it up that bits flew off in all directions.
The main course selected by my daughter was shoulder of lamb.
It was tender and delicious.
The duck chosen by my son again was good but very small.
I had the monkfish.
I think it was the smallest piece of fish I have ever been served.
It was floating in a tasteless murky broth.
My poor husband had the oxtail.
"It was 99% fat and completely tasteless, it was truly disgusting."
The desserts were also variable.
The ice-cream was good and the local cheeses filled my husband up as he was still hungry.
The strudel was covered in extremely thin pastry and only contained 2 sultanas and arrived with the wrong flavoured ice-cream.
The lemon sorbet was good but miniscule.
Ca'n Quiros is representative of the dramatic facelift Port de Sóller has experienced in the last few years.
"Overall this can only be considered as a positive thing, but when I picked up the bill for a simple piece of fish -- “Cap Roig"" -- I vowed never to return."
"The food is presented well, the location -- one of a handful of trendy terraced restaurants adorning the refurbished and pedestrianised harbour -- is excellent, and the atmosphere is relaxing (despite a slightly unnerving and aggressive young man who acts as the maître d') and the service attentive, if somewhat patronising."
"Is it only me who, when ordering in faultless Spanish and responded to in faltering English, gets a tad frustrated?"
"Above all, however, it was the prices that bothered me."
"The problem is that they are not listed on the chalked-up ""catches of the day"" board."
It was my business companion who ordered the fish and I didn't have the gall to question the price.
"I would've liked to have had some advance warning, and perhaps savoured each bite."
"Suffice it to say, I have forgotten the taste of the meal and only have a hole burned in my wallet as a reminder of it."
"In spite of the gentrification of the Port, I urge visitors to resist being conned by a new generation of young upstarts with no restaurant experience, attempting to get a quick buck from seemingly rich tourists."
Ca'n Quiros also have a restaurant in the main square in Sóller where the prices are equally obscene.
"If you have that kind of money to spend on food, my advice is to visit Es Canyis or S'Atic in the port (at the other end from Ca'n Quiros, on the Platja d’en Repic) or Bens D´Avall off the road towards Deia."
"Good restaurant, 5 mins walk from Son Baulo hotel, open at 12-12.30pm every day."
Child friendly.
"This restaurant is lovely, every year we always fit in at least two visits to this great place."
The food is freshly cooked and nicely presented.
"Excellent priced, they seem to have managed to keep the cost the same as previous year, not as most other restaurants which have become quite expensive with the weak pound against the euro."
We been in this restaurant last week end.
They announce to serve fresh sea food.
"We called the day before for reservation, asking for a specific fish."
They said they got it ready.
"When we been on the table the day after, the fish was not available, and after some deliberation and complains they came a bit later with the fish."
"Of course it was farm fish (small turbots are farm made), but the price we paid was like the best fresh fish of the zone."
Also we paid €23 for not fresh 6!!!
(just 6)!!
red prawns (evidently precooked and coming from the frigo).
"They got no price for those kind of dishes, according to market price it can be read!."
"We paid more than €100 for a ""iced lunch""."
"Avoid to go there, scam, liers."
Great food and great host!
Hope they will re-open it in the future.
We'll miss your brilliant sense of humour...
In loving memory of Brian.
The girl next block.
Went to Terravina after having seen the rating on Tripadvisor.
All dressed up for dinner we found out that this is not a restaurant but a bar although listed as restaurant with Tripadvisor.
"Arriving on a Wednesday afternoon, we had planned on grabbing lunch at casa Calvet, but when we arrived at 3:15 (despite the sign stating they were open till 3:30) we did some quick google stalking and located Casa Alfonso."
"Upon entering, the staff were friendly, and offered us smoking or non smoking dining."
"Once seated, the main waiter asked if we spoke English and sent a more fluent waiter in our direction."
"We managed to order a spanish omelette, roasted peppers, and their 'mixed plate' for two."
"When we attempted to order more, the waiter told us we had ordered too much, and suggested we stop with that."
He was right.
"The spanish omelette was served cold, which I did not expect."
It was ok.
"The roasted peppers had a pear glaze, and brie cheese inside."
"I wasnt a huge fan, but my girlfriend was."
"So then the mixed plate arrived - Sausage, chorizo, black pudding, lamb, and a thin strip of steak."
"It also came with fries, roasted peppers, and asparagus."
"We eat alot, and it was more food than we could finish."
The chorizo was awesome.
"We had recently eaten black pudding in Ireland, so we were hesitant, but it was awesome."
The rice had a great flavor.
The sausage was found to be wanting when it came to spice.
"I attempted to order tap water, but was told it was not an option."
"I instead ordered the house red wine, which came in a small pitcher."
It was a decent red - quantity made up for the quality.
"Add in a coke and the total came to 48 euros - far more than I would like to spend on a lunch, but it was more than Id expect to eat on a lunch."
"Overall a good experience, though Im not sure of how value oriented it was."
"However, Ive only been in Barcelona a day - perhaps this is a reasonable price."
We visited this restaurant on the strength of reviews here and elsewhere.
"There is no doubt that it is inexpensive for the location, and the style and decor suggest that you are going to pay more than you do."
"That said, the food is really only average, poorly served by surly staff."
"Barcelona is a wonderful place to spend a weekend, with its museums, the beach, the nice bars and tapas... but when it gets to dinnertime you feel like a fish in the net and it is a lottery to find a place with good cuisine."
"The atmosphere of most of the restaurants is pleasant, but food, well it is hard to find the right place for something special at reasonable prices."
You might trust this suggestion and try Montiel Restaurant from the very first night.
We only discovered it at the very end of our journey and we regret not having had the chance to get back there.
"The owner, Marcos, is a very professional, lovely guy, who without much pomposity, but in very elegant and friendly way at the same time, is suggesting interesting proposals according to the fresh pescado or other particular specialties of the day."
Highly recommendable!
We had intended to visit here since seeing it on a documentary travel programme some years ago on which it was referred to as the 'Secret Cava Bar'.
"This gave the impression it would be hard to find, & tucked away but we found it easily just along from the Picasso Museum."
We stood at the bar for a while as it was packed when we arrived at about 8.30pm but managed to get a table after about 20 mins.
We asked for a bottle of the House Cava - it comes in litre bottles!
& is served in lovely flat saucer glasses.
"The tapas were simple rather than fancy but this suited us just fine - we had some plates of cheese, ham & bread."
The cheese was so good we photographed the label it so we could buy some at one of the local markets.
The Cava was very quaffable & it didn't seem to take long to drink a litre between the 2 of us!
One of the staff (whom we gathered was called Eduardo) asked us if we wanted 'sweet cookies' & we were subsequently presented with a tray of biscuits & sweet pastries along with a generous glass of sweet dessert wine which he indicated we should dip the biscuits into.
Absolutely delicious!
The bill for all of this was about 40 Euros which was extremely good value compared to some of the other places we visited.
The staff were extremely attentive & patient when trying to make ourselves understood in our limited Catalan.
The bar itself is small but has a wonderful atmosphere.
The walls are part tiled & make for great photos.
We popped back the next day just after midday - it was a bit quieter but soon filled up.
I'm so glad we came here & thoroughly recommend a visit.
"Based on reviews, we took an evening out of our 3 day stay in Barcelona to go and visit this Tapas/Cava bar...and we were not disappointed!"
"Straight away, on approaching the bar, we were served our drinks by the owner."
He insisted on trying out a selection of Tapas by pointing to the food.
"We didnt understand Catalonian, but that was not a barrier- we definitely felt welcome here!"
The bar was very busy and the joyous atmosphere made you feel at ease!
"The Tapas was simple, original - but absolutely delicious together with the Cava and we kept asking for more!"
Here you can meet local Barcelonians and tourists who are all very friendly!
We had a great night - I recommend it if you want a break from the Tourist scene and try real Tapas (nothing like the commercial restaurants)!!!
!
A great place for a special meal.
The food was great and inventive.
The service was exceptional.
I first took my wife and daughter to La Dauphin in July 2005 to celebrate my daughters graduation and we all loved it even though it was rather pricey.
"Food, service and ambiance were superb."
However on a return visit last year we were very disappointed.
"The food was just as good, the ambience still superb but there was a gross pretentiousness which was not present before."
This I am afraid spoiled the evening and we will not return unless we here that things have definately changed.
"The food is really original and good (on the fish side), tables outside are great on a sunny day."
"Service is ok and the guy is nice, but you have to be careful reading the menu if you let him suggest you'll end paying a lot, last time it costed me ca 70$ for a lunch alone and didn't feel too loaded at all"
1. it took the waiters 15 minutes to come to our table 2. in an EMPTY restaurant we were asked then to move from the nice and sunny table for six to a dark corner for two.
3. we then decided to have a chicken dish which gave us both extremely bad FOOD POISONING and turned our trip to barcelona into a nightmare.
We've been big fans of the tragaluz group restaurants (have visited numerous times El Japonese and Cuisines de Santa Caterina) but what we've been through in the last 3 days will ensure we keep a safe distance from them in the future.
We dined at Dafne recently during a vist to Santa Cruz.
We found the menu (Greek cuisine) interesting and varied and the service professional but friendly.
"Our food was excellent - well cooked and well presented, We chose a bottle of Greek red wine to accompany our main course - selected from a reasonable list of wines."
We visit Santa Cruz regularly and will go to this restaurant again.
We would also definitely recommend it to anyone planning to be in Santa Cruz.
Good food and wine.
Appeared popular with the locals.
I live in Madrid and really enjoy going to this pub.
The Guinness is like in Dublin.
I usually go to watch the rugby and there is a great buzz in the place.
great curries.. reasonably priced.
nice fresh.
friendly waiters and service
Visited Wikiki a couple of times when the weather was good.
Good service and the food was surprisingly tasty considering the location.
I.e.
it beach location means bad food.
Meat is especially good on the island and both the ribs and burger we had were excellent.
Only went during the day so can't comment on evening.
"I guess that as a tourist choosing a restaurant is always a bet, as probably many places are more oriented at collecting costumers than keeping them due to the tourist flow they have, so it has been a specially pleasurable experience to find this one, where food and service are very good, we came here two times in 5 days because we have been very satisfied with the eating experience at this place."
This restaurant is full of spanish charm.
"The staff speak no english but the food, mainly prepared in the public area, is excellent."
At lunch time there may be a need to wait for a table to become vacant as it is very popular with tourists and locals alike.
"One can recommend any of the meat dishes but be prepared for the size of the portions, we had more than enough every visit."
Reservations may be accepted but our limitation was the need to speak fluent spanish.
Early evening is easy as the locals appear later.
The food was great.
The maitre was nice and could give good and informed advice.
The problem is that the for some reason I was not 100% pleased with the waitress.
"She was not rude, but would not be able to give straight answers and seemed tired or not very enthusiastic about her job (it's true we arrived at 11 pm, but if your staff is going to be tired by then, then it's better to close earlier)."
I believe you can also smoke in the place.
"Although the restaurant was quiet empty and we did not have anyone smoking close by, I could still smell it."
Food is pricey (I would say slightly more than botafumeiro).
"I loved the ""berberechos"" and all the grilled seafood we had."
The langoustines (cigalas) had magnificient vibrant coulours (they seemed as if they had been purpously made out of a mold and hand  painted).
Very tasty indeed.
The octopus (pulpo a feira) was not perfect (I've ad much better one in cheaper venues in Barcelona).
The final bill came about 180 EUR for two.
I think I might try it again some time.
We probably had too high hopes since this was rated at number three in Corralejo.
Typical tourist joint with tasteless food and amateurs as waiters.
"El Pescador implied a fish restaurant, but it has the usual tourist choices from stroganoff to hamburgers."
The canarian potatoes were rubbery and the mojo sauces were majo-based and not fresh.
(None of the staff were Spanish which might be the reason for this.)
"Our main dish, fish and seafood stew, did not taste much and was dull."
"Service was slow, clumsy and they seemed to be confused."
Note: We are not sure we're talking about the same place as the others.
"Since there seems to be two places called Pescador in Corralejo, a ""Gregorian Pescador"" was mentioned by our taxi-driver."
Delicious Spanish seafood dishes.
The signature is the octopus.
"Remember to get in before 22:30, or you will wait for awhile for your table."
In a world where more and more restaurants are indistiguishable from each other Bodeco's really does stand out from the crowd.
Run by Bo (Polish lady) & Declan (Irish gent) it really offers something different.
"The food is absolutely superb, and very individual."
"Don't head here if you want steak & chips or a pizza, but certainly do if you are looking for a relaxed dining experience to delight the tastebuds."
"You can certainly find cheaper places to eat, but that is not to say it's overpriced by any means."
It's like a hidden gem - Mayura exceeded all our expectiations.
"When we saw its website, it looked pretty good."
"When we got there, it looked even better!"
Fantastic interior design - very authentic and grand.
The food was incredibly tasty too - and not badly-priced either.
I would definitely recommend Mayura to any person who loves traditionan Indian food - or for those who want to try it for the first time.
"The restaurant also becomes a lounge bar on thursdays, when it hosts Bollywood Nights."
The decor is diner-like and it's not a place you feel like you are welcome to savor and linger.
The burgers are very good and there is a nice variety of burgers on the menu.
There really isn't anything else.
"It seems a little expensive for what you get, but it's super popular and in Chueca, so that seems to be par for the course."
"I'd go back if I was in the mood for a burger, but it's not a place I'd hang out."
"There was a 10€ menu posted outside, when we requested for it they said they dont serve it ..... For the main course we took a paella ( 11€ each ) but portion were realy small ( even starters are usually bigger ) This paella had 4 small shrimps, it was ridiculous."
Small meal and not tasty.
"They charged 12€ for half bottle of wine ( full bottle price was shown 18€), wine was not good while advised by waitress."
Definitively the bad place to go.
If you want a typical Spanish or catalan sunday lunch on a sunny day in Barceloneta it is a good choice especially if the views and enviroment are important to you.
"There are better places ...in a quality of food to price ratio ...Can Majo, Els Pescadors...but to many people eating in a nice location with views over the port on a sunny day is as important as the food almost and worth a few euros extra..."
I wanted to comment that the previous review mentioned the rip off prawns.
In their defence these were probably palmos red prawns and are much sort after.
"They are always expensive, sometimes 45 euros a plate."
And it would be extremely strange to serve very fresh locally caught prawns already shelled.
"The best bit of top quality super fresh prawns are the heads....In Celler de Can Roca , near Girona, they serve one big purple prawn and you suck the head and accompany with a sweet wine from Malaga and eat the body with a drier wine...prawns are a delicacy."
Cheap tapas bars all over spain serve cheap prawns in garlic oil that are shelled but they are an all together different dish.
Yeah the view is nice and the restaurant looks impressive but appearances are deceiving.
I don't know why anyone would go here when there are other tastier and less expensive places in the city.
The food was salty to the point of being inedible and cost twice as much as other places.
We paid over 100 Euros for our meal that was left mostly uneaten when we normally paid less than 50 for a multicourse meal.
It was the most expensive meal I had in Barcelona but the worst food.
"I don't know how this place got such a great review from the other reviewers...not only was the food expensive, it was one of the worst meals that I've had in quite some time."
My paella with seafood was very salty as was my friend's shrimp in garlic sauce.
"The salt cod with paprika that my friend ordered had no taste whatsoever, despite it being salt cod."
STAY AWAY!!!
I wouldn't even recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy.
Wonderful food.
"After a weekend in barcelona, and not finding the best food around, we asked a bartender at our hotel for his personal favorite....and ended up at Barceloneta."
The paella and sangria were top notch.
"total meal was about 85 euros (included appetizer, two mains, and pitcher of sangria)"
Botin bills itself as the worlds oldest restaurant which started serving food in 1726.
"Of course you will get tourists, as well as locals."
All sorts of people might be curious to see what this place offers.
And what it offers is old school charm and good food.
"Not great food, but definitely solid."
"Heavy on meats and potatoes, the ovens are as old as the restaurant."
"Just off plaza mayor, grab a nice meal in a real spanish establishment before grabbing a drink in the plaza."
"I enjoy feeling history, and you certainly do not get history like this very often"
"Frankly, I am shocked by the positive reviews for this restaurant."
"Nothing about it is attractive, except may be its storied past."
"The present, however, is far more prosaic."
Botafumeiro serves overcooked food of questionable freshness while making it bland and tasteless.
"When we complained and tried to send some dishes back, we experienced a most unpleasant interaction."
No apologies extended and nothing taken off the check.
This place preys on unsuspecting tourists and thrives because travel writers are lazy and don't update their reviews.
"It is a shame to eat here in Barcelona, where so many other places are just amazing."
Avoid at all costs and discount the food reviews of anyone who graded this place highly.
Over priced and over rated.
The food wasn't that great - for the price they charge.
I've had better pub food than this.
"And the atmosphere is busy, busy, busy and very hectic."
Felt very rushed.
Not very creative in the vegetarian department.
And they charged a lot for relatively cheap and common Cava.
I would certainly recommend this restaurant.
"Yes, it has a wonderful view of the Alhambra, lit up at night."
"But the reasons for choosing it are the wonderful food and the lovely, slightly quirky atmosphere."
It is in a house within a garden in a tiny narrow street within the Albaicin quarter.
You will marvel at the skill of the taxi driver who takes you there.
Once inside you think you are sitting in the dining room of a private house.
The food is true Andalucian in nature and is cooked and presented to a very high quality.
My wife and I had turbot with an apple sauce as a main course.
It was truly memorable.
Deserts (apparently made in a local convent) were execllent.
Service was excellent and helpful -to the extent of taking us through the narrow streets to our taxi at the end of the meal.
It has a big name among the restaurant in Jerez.
Thait is why you expect more than you get.
"The food is good but overpriced, the service is not steady you have to be catching the waiter's attention all the time, so you cannot fully enjoy the meal."
The wait for a table is unusually long and they do not care if you leave.
They should improve if they want to keep up with their promotion.
This is one of the nicest restaurants in Nerja.
"It's very, very typically Spanish, and an absolute hit with the locals- which you can take to be a good sign!"
"The staff are better than you would get in most restaurants- very attentive and friendly, with marvelous English and Spanish."
The menu has something for everyone and has a very Spanish flavour.
My personal recommendations would be the lettuce hearts (starter) and the steak or rosada for a main- but I've never tried anything there that I haven't liked!
While you're waiting for your food they bring you an amuse bouche which is a lovely touch.
"This is a fine restaurant for families as the restaurant is located on a square that has a playground in the middle, but don't let that put you off if you aren't dining with children."
It is such a romantic setting- with a bottle of rioja- you can't beat it!
"After trying to find a good tapas bar not out to rip off tourists, we happened upon this one."
It was fantastic.
Two of us had a litre of sangria and 20 tapas for 43 euros.
All were freshly prepared and delicous.
We're meeting friends here later in the week for sure!
I am going again to ibiza this Aug.
"I went in 2005, with my other half and this will be his 6th time to the island."
And we both love ibiza.
He took me to the Curry Club.
All of this friends recomened the curry club too.
They go every year...... And it was lovely.
Everything about the place was nice.
"The seating area out side, the lighting of the place was also very relaxing.The waiters where very polite."
And the food was good.
I will be returning this year.
I could see why the like it.
"First time at El Quim, I ordered cafe on leche and tortilla espanola (veggie & potato omelet) for breakfast."
The coffee was excellent but the omelet was way too salty and greasy.
Tab: €7.
"On my second visit, I ordered whatever my neighbor (local dude) had, which was a pale sausage with grilled poblano-type chili and deep fried potato quarters with cafe on leche."
It wasn't the best breakfast I've had but decent.
Tab: €12.
"During my third and final visit, I stopped by for the cafe on leche only because I've already had breakfast at Pinotxo Bar instead."
This review is based on the breakfast menu only.
I didn't eat lunch or dinner here.
Nice atmosphere.
Decent food.
There is much room for improvement in service.
It was a good experience (little bit pricey ...).
"best value,fantastic food,friendly service ,in relation with the local culture."
sea front terrasse and nice decoration.
A modern take on an older style is how the interior greets you.
Certainly the restaurant is modern take on the old.
The presentation is upscale without pretension.
The service is excellent.
The food phenomenal.
I had Venison Paella - beyond delicious.
"We all tried each others dishes (all excellent) and, had we the opportunity, would come back a few more times to try more."
"Language is a bit of a barrier if you speak no Spanish, but we made ourselves understood."
"The owner is a gem, letting our photographer on the roof to photograph the city Cathedral."
Don't recall what we paid - I didn't see the tab.
"But whatever it was, it was well worth it."
We only visited Cordoba for 2 days but were so impressed with this reataurant we ate there for lunch both days.
"The tapas was excellent, the service friendly and attentive and they were really good with our kids."
Definitely recommended.
Let's just say we weren t as hungry anymore when a huge cockroach came out of the kitchen towards our table.
"The waiter crushed it, pushed it away under a closed and did not mind excusing himself."
Been to natalie's lots of times its a cafe not a restaurant good for morning fry ups but nothing special.
It has all the British dishes like pie & chips sausage & chips roast dinners and puddings not what i want to eat on holiday but i'm amazed at the amount of people that eat in there at night.
Friendly owners give the kids a free lolly as i said we go for breakfast because its close to were we stay and they are friendly but its nothing special and not really that cheap.
"On a narrow street in the heart of old Seville, this is a pleasant bar with a good selection of generous tapas and attentive service (plenty of seating)."
"Excellent for a light lunch (for those not up to Spanish eating habits), or late-night snacks (for those who are)."
Drawback: it's difficult to find.
Ask someone at your hotel to give you directions!
We planned our trip to San Sebastian around food.
We ate our way from Extebarri (Brilliant restaurant) to Arzak.
It was ok but not as good as you would hope.
Food was well presented and tasty enough.
The wine selection was excellent and very well priced for the choices but it just wasn't a 3 star.
"Things like a hair on the plate (the ultimate sin - followed with no real remorse or apology), having to pour your own wine after the glass being empty for 5 min, incorrect menu's being given all disappointed us."
"The one big plus, the chef and owner personally coming to our table to introduce herself and chat with us."
Great PR but i think getting the waiters to stop talking next to my empty glass and filling it would be much better.
"After eating in other 3 start restaurants such as Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, this restaurant is not in that class."
"The best restaurant in San Pedro Spain has got to be Brunnings,it is a German restaurant."
with great quality and big portions.Better to book a table.
Put simply - fine dining for Germans and Germans only.
Run by a German chef and his Asian wife who looks after the front of house.
"The most unfriendly people we have met in San Pedro, we get the feeling that running the Restaurant as a bit too much for them."
"There is no warm welcome here, upon approaching the Restaurant you are interviewed in order to assess the capacity of your wallet."
Forget it if you have kids - no access allowed.
"Very 1970s (Prawn cocktail with Mary Rose sauce style), very unfriendly though the food looks not bad."
We passed the first interview stage and got a table but the Asian wife mistakenly believed that our kids belonged to the couple behind us.
Once she realised that they were our kids she refused to give us the table.
"Go accross the road and around the corner to Caruso's Restaurant - charming owner, charming atmosphere and great food."
Went there on a Friday at 1300H.
"Even though the sign said the bar was open from 900H to 2300H, when I got there the lady bartender just ignored me."
I took a seat and grabbed her attention.
"After about 5 minutes of waiting aimlessly while she chatted with her colleagues, she finally came up to me."
"When I began to talk to her to ask if she spoke English, she replied with a rude tone ""Just speak whatever language and I will answer you."""
"She then told me that they are closed because the chef was still eating, and that I could wait for 30 mins if I want."
She had a very rude and curt air about her which she carried out during my entire meal.
She did the same to another group of guests who simply left after waiting for almost 10-15 mins with nobody attending to them.
"She gave me the menu, then never really came back to get my order."
A big group of tourists came and I understood that she was busy serving them.
"I was looking at her, just curious as to what she was doing (there are not a lot of options when you're sitting in the bar) but I can't believe when she told me off."
"""I know that you want to order but let me finish this."
"You don't have to keep looking at me!"""
Again in a very rude tone.
"When I finally got to order, I was choosing things from the daily specials (written on the blackboard), when she told me: ""Forget about those, those are yesterday's"" and quickly shuffled off to attend to other guests."
"Finally, after 5 minutes, she gets back to me and takes my order."
"When I ordered the fresh fruit juice, she tells me that it's not available as the juice bar will open in another 15 mins."
"To be fair, the food was good."
"But with such lousy service, is it worth it?"
Will never go back again.
"Attentive service, excellent food and good wines."
A rather small and intimate restaurant.
Worth coming back.
"Skina was my choice to dine, small, 5 or 6 tables, looked very intimate."
They just received their michelin star so My wife and I wanted to try it.
We ordered a starter and a main course.
"We were treated to 2 pre starters, some kind of pizza thing that seemed a little gimicky and a poached egg with mayo on the outside."
"The egg was ok. We did not realize that these pre starters were not part of the meal, when the check came we were suprised to see them on the bill, 4 euro per portion came to 16euro total added on the bill, but Skina was nice enough to take 2 of them off the bill because our hotel had recommended the place."
"We ordered an appetizer to split, what arrived were 2 scallops, 1 for each of us, 20euro total."
"The meal was good, the presentation was excellent."
Very small portions for the price.
"We ordered dessert and it was not much better, I had Chocolate Zen and My wife had some almond wrap thing, both were ok."
"The atmosphere seemed a bit stuffy to us, like they were trying to be too formal, it resulted in feeling a bit cold and generic."
"We have eaten at many five star restaurants and this one just seemed to try and be a bit too formal, we actually felt a bit uncomfortable."
"On a positive side, the wine that was recommended for us was excellent, very reasonable."
"It was good to experience it once, we would not go back."
"The value for your money is just not there, you will pay more for presentation than actual portion size and we are by no means big eaters."
We went out and had some tapas afterwards and joked about the experience
An enjoyable way to have tea in the Moroccan Style.
An experience not to be missed.
"Three of us had tea, one had a Hot Chocolate - Solo."
It was magnificent.
Consistency of chocolate pudding in a cup with a slight bitter edge to it.
Excellent.
The sweets are good too.
A fine selection of teas to choose from.
"Tried to book but couldn.t get through.Menu and restaurant looked great ,will definately try to get in on next visit.NOTE It is located right in the centre of the village and not in any neighbouring village as the map indicates"
If you are looking for a noisy Spanish tapas bar this is probably not your place.
"However, if you like top cuisine with high quality raw materials blended and cooked in an experimental way, you cannot miss this restaurant."
"Excellent, original dishes, amazing service and located in the olympic harbor area, one of the most beautiful places in Barcelona."
What else could you ask for?.
Cheap?
Probably not but you are not going to get more bang for your buck anywhere else.
"The menu is now in seven language, this should have been a warning to begin with."
"While the traditional atmosphere and interiors can compensate a little for the unfriendly service, the dishes were disappointing."
"We first had oysters and a rucola salad, which were the acceptable, but he paella was almost inedible because of its salt content and was of little delight also by its appearance and composition."
Creme catalan as a desert not outstanding.
Prices too high for the quality served.
Visited El Vivero for lunch on Sunday 15 March 2009.
"Have visited before a number of times with friends, mainly for the location and have never quite been sure about the food or service."
"Our experience on Sunday confirmed what I thought; extremely rude, grumpy, scowling and seemingly resentful waiters mirrored by a similar appalling dismissive attitude from the manager/owner."
Although this wasn't consistent as other customers appeared to get (only slightly) better treatment.
"Very average food and the general attitude made us feel very uncomfortable and we couldn't wait to leave, it was as if we were an intrusion to their day."
I was entertaining a friend on a first visit to Sitges and how embarrassed and disappointed I was for him to get this experience.
"How do people like this stay in business, they clearly have issues and it wasn't worth complaining."
We were even scowled at for not leaving a tip!
Don't go here; there are far better places in Sitges to spend your money and get great food and great service.
We thought that maybe they had taken on a 'Fawlty Towers' approach for a joke; it doesn't work and I don't think they are bright enough.
Me and my wife have eatn here for the last 10 years Food the best Service best in Ibiza FOR A FUN NIGHT OUT GO There WWW.TIJUANATEXMEX.COM
"The location is just perfect, the food is quite different but lovely (spanish fusion with international), good price and awesome staff."
Beware of this charming looking bar in the historic centre of Madrid.
It is a trap for innocent tourists.
We were taken to a small room at the back as the bar was too crowded.
"The manager jumped on us and pretending that he could not understand basic english or broken spanish, forced upon us huge platters of ham, cheese, tuna salad and prawns- and as we protested that we only asked for half portions or a taste, he refused to return it."
"The bread was stale, the ham fatty and the cheese tasteless; the salad was swimminfg in dirty water and canned tuna and we could not eat it."
The glasses of cheap house wine were tiny and charged at full price.
"Worst of all was the bill 18 euros per portion plus 2 glasses of wine, about 80 Euros for a meal for 2 ."
More expensive than the Ritz hotel !
"And all this for a dirty back room, bad ingredients and no cooking involved at all."
"We met other tourists with the same experience, so be careful."
"Went for the 3 course Sunday lunch, great choices and the food was very good."
Pleasant setting and the value was outstanding!
Four of us had dinner the other night at Can Romenet in the Barceloneta area.
"Famed as the oldest restaurant in this seaside neighborhood, Romenet had been recommended by a friend."
We were quite disappointed.
"We speak fluent Spanish, so language was not a problem."
"While the appetizers and desserts were OK, the entrees were awful."
"In the first place, the waiter got 3 of 4 orders wrong - bringing the meat and seafood paella when just seafood was ordered and bringing two fish dishes with the Romesco sauce (more on that later) when one had been ordered with white beans."
"The paella was overly salty, the seafood in it was rubbery, and the pieces of chicken and sausage practically impossible to identify - more like lumps of a salty sponge from your kitchen sink."
"The Romesco sauce (supposedly made of pureed nuts, chiles, tomatoes and garlic) tasted well, like a basic brown sauce which tasted of nothing but salt."
"When we complained about the mistakes, the waiter argued with us!"
"At close to 200 Euros, the dinner was a total rip-off."
"The best item of the night were the pinole cookies for dessert - fresh, buttery, interesting taste and served with a small glass of liquer."
But they hardly saved a disastrous and expensive meal.
We had a much bettter meal the next night at a tapas place for a third of the price.
I was so pleased i made the effort when in Barcelona to take a 15minute taxi ride  for a meal at El Cingle.
I found out about the restaurant in an article in Conde Nast Traveller and booked a meal for my partners Birthday.
When we arrived in a small village square El Cingle is tucked away in the corner and  doesnt look much but upon entering it opens up into a beautiful dining room with amazing views and you get that warm feeling that its going to be a good night.
My partner and i were not disapointed with an amazing tasteing menu.
Ive eaten in lots of michelin starred restaurants and El Cingle is up there with them.
Strongly recommended if you love your food.
We've eaten Indian food all over and found this to be amongst the best.
"Wonderful, freshly prepared food, generous portions, exquisite flavours with the expected spicyness, which doesn't over-ride the main ingredient."
The prices are reasonable.
"The staff are helpful and friendly and the restaurant ambience especially pleasant in the summer, when eating outside."
Expect it to be busy at peak holiday times!
although this doesn't seem to affect the very good service too much.
Adequate food.
Main reason for going is to see the kitchen and warren of wood panelled rooms.
"I visited this restaraunt during Mobile World Congress (=a very ""crowdy"" period) without reservation."
We just waited 15 minutes and we were promptly served.
Jamon +Snails for starters were superb!
Chicken on spit for main course was excellent !
"Riojha wine was good, and Creme Catalana for desert completed a delicious dinner."
"The building, the open rustic kitchen, the wooden panels and decoration add to a fantastic environment and the great experience."
I will definetely go there again in my next visit.
Great paella!
We were taken to this restaurant purely on its reputation and how disappointing it was.
This turned out to be a dreadful tourist restaurant.
"Granted, it had a welcoming and interesting interior, but the food was expensive and awful."
"I was awaiting and relishing a seafood paella and I am not sure if what I received was peculiar to Barcelona, but it definitely had a meat stock in it and tasted horrible."
The rabbit ordered was literally skin and bone.
The waiters argued that rabbits were skinny in Spain!
The steak ordered was sent back twice due to it being raw after ordering it well done.
All four of us were disappointed with our food and the waiters were seen laughing in the background after we had complained.
The management were equally unhelpful and refused to alter our bill.
"Perhaps we are used to better standards, but we got better service and food in far lesser known establishments."
"Dont be disappointed, go somewhere else."
What a great place to enjoy some tapas and have a glass of wine.
Great location (Gran Via) and mainly catering for locals.
Great Japanese... good value for money.
The pizza topping was very 'wet' with runny tomato.
It tasted fine but there was no way you could pick up a slice as it was too soggy.
"Although we sat in the non-smoking restaurant, the smell of smoke fro the bar area was intrsive."
The decor is cosy & funky & the service very pleasant.
They have a great system at this restaurant.
"You sit down,order a drink and they will bring you an empty plate as well."
Waiters bring round plates of different tapas to all the tables and you can pick and choose what you want for as long as you want.
They count the number of cocktail sticks to work out how much you have eaten.
Plain wooden sticks are cheaper than the plastic ones.
"The variety of dishes was fantastic, with lamb, beef, fish, cheese and veggie options."
There are also larger portions available if you want more - I found that 4/5 smaller tapas snacks were enough but my husband opted to have a lovely chicken with a mushroom sauce dish.
It is a friendly place with a great atmosphere and lots of Spanish people calling in on their way home from work.
They are changing the menu regularly and always offer dishes very interesting and savory...
I will however not recommend to go on Sundays because I have been disappointed several times (lack of freshness) but the rest of the week has always been great!
Went there in summer 2006.
Had the tasting menu.
"The choice of bread was fantastic, fresh and delicious."
The service was good (as one would expect from a michelin-star restaurant) but not excellent.
We had only one issue to mention: we ask for a bottle of cava and it took about 20 mins to arrive.
The waiter correctly apologised mentioning they had to chill it.
Ok.
However the cava wasn't still chilled when served.
A pity indeed.
On the positive side: I had one of the best lamb dishes ever (suckling lamb with goat cheese and mint foam - I can still remember!).
"For just 200 euro for two, I would recommend to visit."
"I like the food at Bazaar, I like their prices."
"But the service - oh boy, even for a town with consistently slow and inattentive service this place is remarkably bad ."
"The place is visually a stunner - big windows throughout, and whitewashed walls with old-timey wooden cabinets full of jars of different sizes starting on the upstairs smoking section that carry through to the non-smoking basement (which is considerably spacious and high-ceilinged, which makes it not feel like a basement at all)."
"Reservations are not accepted and seating is then first-come, first-served - which means I would recommend showing up around 9 PM or shortly thereafter or risking a 30-minute wait."
"The menu is interesting, there are a lot of options."
"In a touch of trendiness they've decided to run all the dishes together on a long list, without a break between appetizers, entrees and desserts: it's all one long list, and you'll have to scan the prices to figure out when things start breaking into the main dishes."
There are a few global touches here and there.
And the few things I've had have been tasty and interesting.
"The wines are incredibly cheap, which is not a bad thing on a casual place."
Now for the service - or lack thereof.
"Servers amble between the tables at whatever leisurely pace they feel compelled to take, usually trying to avoid eye contact with diners."
They are not very helpful at describing any item in the menu.
"Their demeanor in general is on a sliding range between ""I don't care"" and ""What are you bugging me for?""."
Even paying your freaking bill can take a while - the last time it took them 15 minutes to bring me the check and another 15/20 to come back with my credit card after I had given it to them.
And this level of service was consistent on both times I dined there.
"Considering that this is a place that supposedly works on a non-reservation basis, I don't understand how they don't get better servers that can cheerfully turn the crowd around in time."
"Overall I'd like to recommend this place, but have such reservations about the service I can't."
"If you don't mind it, go ahead - prices are good, food is good."
"But if you come from a place with speedy and attentive service, you'll find yourself infuriated."
This is a typically Spanish tapas bar that specialises in fried fish and seafood.
We visited w/c 16/3/09 - the most expensive dish was the plate of fried seafood.
There was more than enough for two and reasonable too at 15 Euros for the two of us.
In fact the whole bill (including several glasses of wine at Euros 1.40 each and other sideplates) was less than Euros 40 for the two of us.
"The service was excellent, very friendly and helpful Spanish speaking staff so we communicated with much pointing and the help of Spanish/English speaking locals."
Bodega Quitepenas is situated on the main shopping street which leads from the beach area of Torremolinos to the twon centre.
"Beware those tourists who are not quite as able as the rest of us, because Bodega Quitapenas lies on a very steep hill that is only reached if you can manage stairs."
There are provisions made for prams/wheelchairs etc but I feel you would need someone with strong arm muscles to navigate the hill.
But the reward is well worththe effort.
"The free shot with the bartender after the meal was greatly appreciated, but the food was awful."
I had the pesto gnocchi and it was WAY TOO salty!
"Tried the pizza, and it was fine, not outstanding."
The food and the service is very good.
Have lots of staff who take a pride in their job.
Ate at this restaurant on recommendation from bar man at the Barcelona Princess.
"Went here on the 1st night of our stay and had a wonderful 'fish stew' containing hake, monkfish, prawns, langoustines etc with a delicious sauce."
Very good value for money Euro 87 including 2 bottles of wine.
However BEWARE - after being unable to book a restaurant for husband's 50th birthday returned to this restaurant on the last evening.
Were greeted like old friends and taken through to the main restaurant and introduced to Ramon who is a bit of a character.
His job is obviously to sell you an expensive dinner.
"We were shown a plate of fish - lobster, langoustines, dover sole etc."
Aware that what we had ordered would cost more than previous visit BUT THE BILL WAS EURO 280!!!!!!
No arguing after you have eaten it!!!!
Do try this restaurant - it is the busiest at Port Olimpic but ask to look at the menu 1st!!!!
!
This lovely restaurant serves heaping mounds of tasty paella in an elegant atmosphere.
"It caters to the tourist crowd and is definitely more expensive than local tapas bars, but the food is worth it."
"My wife and I recently returned here having been before and it still had the charm, the same staff and the amazing food 4 years ago ."
"The only thing that had changed was that they now have a menu in English (nowhere can remain ""unspolit"" forever!)."
The staff are amazingly friendly - when we were there in 2005 the staff insisted we have a drink on them.
"The food is a little more expensive than the other tapas places around, but it is fabulous."
"They have a wide variety of seafood and other dishes, many of which are displayed in the chilled units in the bar."
"I think they do larger dishes, but we have always stuck to the tapas so we could try more things."
"Having been to Zaragoza twice I guess that's it for us, just a shame we will never eat here again."
"Situated on the same promenade as Bar M, and Iticha, the Bay Bar is further down just past KFC heading towards the San An Bay area."
"Its a funky, stylish and cool, local Ibicenco music bar, managed by the same team that ran Cafe Mambo when it was at its peak."
"The decor is stylish with relaxing chill out areas, moroccan cushions and day beds suspended from the ceiling in the outdoor terrace."
"The cafe serves a simple bistro style menu that is ideal for a snack, but not as a full meal."
"The speciality are Cocktails, Mojitos,Caipirinhas, Kiaporoskas and Coco Locos all freshly prepared at the outdoor cocktail bar ."
You will often catch a glimpse of a Big Name DJ chilling out and relaxing with friends as the Bar is away from the main Sunset Strip drag and is very laid back.
"The Manager Miguel (the one and only) is well known on the Island for his contacts and if he cant get you in to the VIP at Pacha or Amensia, nobody will!"
"The Bay Bar is not cheap, so don't expect a £1 a pint prices!"
We found this place and kept returning as it was the best.
They have the best duck I've ever eaten.
The food/staff/service/décor are all excellent.
The prices are fantastic for the quality on offer.
The staff have good English and were so friendly!
If you like good quality food you have to eat here!!!!!!
Reservations: 922 36 81 72
Very cozy place in a tiny village with a beautiful surrounding provided by the nature.
"The staff is very friendly and helpful, our room was very homy and clean."
Breakfast was included in the 57EUR/night total price for a double room (tax included).
"The breakfast itself was pretty okay, with an average choice."
"We also had a dinner at the restaurant for a very friendly price, and were satisfied with our meals."
I highly recommend their sangria :) A perfect place to spend a night when travelling from the South towards the North through the mountains.
The national parks and the Teide is also nearby.
"El Cucurucho is effectively smack bang between Gran Via and the Convento de Descalzes, and about a block away from El Cortes Ingles - which makes it the perfect place to come for lunch between shops or sightseeing nearby."
"We arrived quite late, close to 4, when normally restaurants won't serve lunch, but they were quite happy to take us - I assume this means their kitchen doesn't close."
"The decor is very cute - bordering on kitsch, although very charming all the same."
"Seashells are in abundance and adorn light fittings, mirror frames and the like."
"Theire is a menu del dia on offer at lunch, although the carte menu prices are quite reasonable."
"We ate seafood soup, which was delicious with sweet, fresh seafood."
"We also had a delicious omelet with garlic, wild mushrooms and nettles."
First floor restaurant in the village square with a reasonable menu where game is a speciality.I read somewhere that the wine list was excellent but it did not appear special to me.The food was was good but why do they persist in serving it on cold plates!Service was reasonable but the restaurant was very quiet(March)The bill was pretty expensive £50 per head(we did have wine ) and I would not rush back but its worth a look.
Just an elegant restaurant with a bit overpriced food
This place is amazing.
"If I could, I'd give it three thumbs up."
Multiple laminated photographs provide a helpful pictorial for the vast fresh seafood available.
Staff is friendly and efficient.
The dishes are simple and fresh.
"My partner had the sole with two lovely green-red tomatoes (almost a delicacy in themselves), brussel sprouts, and potatoes."
My baked hake was too easy to eat; it didn't need much of anything to dress it up.
Potatoes finished the entree and we both had fruit for dessert.
"The pineapple and quantro was refreshing as was the melon--honestly, it melted in my mouth--highly recommend finishing off the meal with fresh fruit."
I wish I had a place like this in my neighborhood.
Worth every penny.
I have been to Nuevo Lanjaron several times over the last 2 years and have NEVER been disappointed.
Many locals eat here so I guess that says a lot.
The staff are always friendly and welcoming.
Must recommend the aubergines chips deep fried in honey.....yumm!
It's not a place that you would dress up to go to - but a place that foodies would love.
It's near the shopping centre of Torremolinos so it's a good place to go for a really good tasty meal before or after hitting the shops!
"My partner celebrated his birthday, so I wanted to treat him with something very special."
This restaurant seemed to be the perfect choice upon traveller reviews and local people's recommendation.
During our stay in Tenerife this was the most amazing night we've had at El Molino Blanco.
I was prepared to pay a lot as everyone suggested how expensive the restaurant was.
"Compared to other local restaurants it is a bit pricey indeed, however if we go out in the UK or Ireland, we would not get the same quality of food and entertainment for the same price."
And after all you're on holiday in Tenerife so you should make the most of it!
Book your table beforehand though as the place is very busy - note: they will pick up the phone during daytime - they must be very busy at night as first I tried to ring them in the evening to book without any luck.
I thought the menu would be more extensive - there were ca.
"8 different tapas dishes, 8 starters and around 10-12 main courses."
"We could make our choice all right, but again compared to other places in the area El Molino's menu was a bit too short."
"I found the starters to be very expensive, they're just about the same price as the main courses - eur 17-20 - and of course they aren't big portions."
The entertainment during our meal consisted of a pianist who then later was joined by a violinist and then a singing chef!
We felt like in paradise!
I even received a rose from the chef!
"My partner had a starter,main,dessert, I had a tapas,main,dessert and we had a bottle of wine with a bottle of water and all we paid was 93 euro."
I would not consider this expensive looking at the experience we've got for it.
"I would absolutely recommend this place when you're in Tenerife, you shouldn't miss it."
Go and see it for yourself!
"This restaurant is not immediatly on the coast, but it's worth a taxi ride to get here if you are looking for a special romantic evening."
"I have rarely seen such a beautiful interior in a restaurant, being there is just fashinating."
"During our dinner there was also live music, the food was very good, the service perfect."
during a weeks stay in Tenerife we visited Blanco twice.
Firstly with friends then on our last night...Food was good prices were sensible...Bothe enjoyable night
Excellent menu of dishes based on fresh ingredients with interesting flavours.
"We especially loved the skewer of mixed grilled fish with lime & coconut flavoured rice, tuna carpaccio."
Cosy feeling to the restaurant and very friendly but not invasive service.
Very happy
"The service was very good, the food was priced appropriately for the portions."
We had seafood dishes and starters that were perfectly prepared.
"Ambiance was very good, staff was personable but not overbearing."
Wine list is good.
Would definitely recommend
This hotel is so very run down and is in dire need of refurbishment.
"We checked the reviews on here and saw some really positive ones, it as it was a cheap get-away we thought it would be OK -- but it was much worse than we thought."
The external areas were clean and nice (grecian style) but inside the rooms were another story altogether.
It smelt of stale cigarettes (even right after the cleaner had been - which was not every day by the way).
It was also so scruffy that even when cleaned it still looked and felt grubby.
The male receptionist was also really rude and unfriendly.
Costa Adeje is lovely though and we are going back next year but not to this hotel (ever).
"staff very good,great value.The best chinese in the port.try the irish bar for a guiness beforehand."
This restaurant is situated in Estepona Port opposite the boat shop.
The restaurant offers seating inside and out opposite the harbour underneath the Irish bar.
The menu is printed in three languages and the serving staff have always been very helpful and polite.
The food is freshly cooked to order and I have found it to be consistently better than most Chinese restaurants in London...let alone Spain.
"I've found the portions are generous and always served piping hot, in fact during one hot summer, I found myself eating a vegetarian meal at this place which is very unusual for me."
"I have been to Ibiza a few times and the infamous café del mar was on the top of my to-do list the first time I visited San antonio, though i had a bit of trouble finding it (My sense of direction is not the best!)"
"We stumbled upon Cafe del mar on our way back from a nights clubbing and it was closed, and looked very unimpressive, I couldn't believe it...is this what everyone was talking about?"
"On a subsequent visit with a different friend I decided i would give it a go, just to say I had been..and I was pleasently suprised!"
In the evening when all the chairs are out on the seafront it's a totally different experience.
We ordered a cocktail each (which were quite pricey at €11 each!)
and settled down to wait for another amazing sunset... and although the Sunset is as beautiful wherever you sit i can safely say Cafe del Mar definitely enhanced the experience.
As the sun settled behind the horizon a strange calm silence settled over the crowd (which was substantial by this time) which took my breath away.
As I said before this was not my first visit to Ibiza and knew only too well how breathtaking the Sunsets were but this was a totally different experience than before.
"As the last glimpses of the sun dissappeared the crowd broke in a spontaneous round of applause and cheering and everywhere there were couples kissing and friends hugging and posing for photos, i found it a really special evening and would strongly recommend it."
Yes the drink IS a bit pricey so if you are on a budget you can bring your own drink and sit on the rocks in front of the cafe for a cheaper option (although I am not sure if this is entirely allowed I saw plenty of people doing it when i was there) But if you can stretch to a couple of drinks I would advise getting there early and getting a seat...you won't be dissappointed!
"On my annual visit to Ibiza this year i am definitely going back and I am going to get one of the seats inside, they are on a raised mezzenine level with really comfy couches that have a perfect view of the sunset and the interior is decorated to look like you're lying in the clouds...bliss!"
"On main dining square the pedestrianised Plaza del Socorro, beautiful original building with traditional furnishing."
"All staff were welcoming and professional, some spoke excellent English."
"Good selection of mainly Andelusian food with great value set menus, house red is a good local wine at a great price."
All dishes were well prepared and of the highest quality.
We would definitely recommend this restaurant.
"On my first visit, I ordered whatever my neighbor had, which was beef cheeks stewed in roasted red peppers, raisins, pine nuts and tomatoes."
It came with a big hunk of bread for soaking up the sauce.
"With a cup of cafe on leche, it was excellent."
Tab: €7.
"On my 2nd visit, I ordered the tribe stewed the same way as mentioned above with a cup of coffee (special of the day apparently because El Quim, the other famous breakfast place at Mercato de la Boqueria had the same dish, had the same dish."
Tab: €7.
N.B.
: I didn't speak much Spanish so I pretty much pointed at whatever someone else was eating and went with it.
"we tried the india gate during a recent trip to benidorm,we choose the 38euro for 2 menu and there was a great choice to pick from."
the food was very good and we were not disappointed
This place is so much fun.
We came in at 22.00 in the evening and the place was packed.
"So if you go, go early, or go very late (open untill 1.30) because we met some girls who waited 1,5 hour for a table."
We were lucky to wait at the bar and jumped on the bar stools as soon as some Spanish people left (with some help of a very friendly Spanish guy).
"Before you start eating, take five minutes just to observe everything that happens around you, it's crazy."
I do have a lot of respect for the people who work here because believe me they work their butts off.
"Everybody is shouting, running etc etc."
Locals and turists are mixed and it has such a lively atmosphere.
The food is great and we only paid 35 euros the two of us including drinks so not expensive at all.
The next night we came again and everyhting was as good as the night before.
We will defintaley come back next time we visit Barcelona.
Felt really welcome here.
A wonderful choice for the tourist in Madrid.
Delicious and varied menu of spanish specialities.
"great setting, romantic light, good wine and very honest pricing."
Clean presentation and good quality ingredients in sleek surroundings.
A much more pleasant experience than some over-crowded and expensive traditional tapas bars.
Go early if you want to choose your table.
Visited the restaurnat in Santa Ana twice in a 4 day stay and still have tapas I want to try.
Great place and location.
This Restaurante LagOmar is part of the LagOmar house and garden originally designed and built for Omar Sharif.
The restaurant has a separate entrance to the house although once you are inside you get a good view of the grounds.
We went at lunchtime and there were quite a few people popping in for drinks but we were the only ones eating.
We started with a complementary tapas of cold meat and shared a starter which was prawns and avocado.
For a main course I had duck and my wife had sea bass.
For desert we had an apple and ice cream dish and I had tiramisu.
I had a couple of glasses of wine and the wife was driving so just water for her.
Finally we had a tea and an expresso.
That little lot came to €68 plus tip which I thought was reasonable.
All the food was very well prepared and presented and above all - yummy!
I thought the service was a little offhand but I wouldn't let that put you off.
The tables outside on the terrace were a bit rickety but the ones inside looked fine.
I'd be interested to know how much business they do in the evening.
It's quite a nice location for a meal but it's in a pretty small village and that would mean that most of their customers will either have to drive or come by taxi.
"After discovering Begur following a day visit - we decided to go back and spend a night so we could have a night on the town (we had been staying in a great little villa in Calonge, but it was drive to anywhere) Fonda Caner has a Michelin guide listing and is also listed in one of the guide books at our villa."
"When we arrived on a Saturday evening, we were greeted warmly and given a glass of Cava - unexpected but very welcome."
Whilst choosing from the menu we were served with three small dishes of apetisers to get our taste buds going - again unexpected.
"We choose from the A la carte menu although there is a good choice of fixed priced menus, tapas and a taster menu."
We had the Snails and Salmon Ravoli with goats cheese to start - both very generous portions.
For main we choose the confit of chicken with star anise and stuffed lamb shoulder and choose a bottle of Tempranillo - Raimat 2002 which was excellent.
"The choices from the desert trolley were very well presented and very tempting, we both choose a chocolate mousse - one raspberry the other white chocolate."
The food is fantastic and the service excellent and the price extremely reasonable.
"As with the related Quinze Nits, I was disappointed by this place."
"I can't understand why these places are so popular, they're so overrated."
"After years of seeing the queues outside, I finally got a chance to go, and it's OK, but frankly nothing to phone home about, and certainly not worth queuing up for."
"Some of the food we had was quite nice, but other things were decidedly less so."
"And the service was desperatingly slow, even though it was not a particularly busy night."
I won't be repeating.
"This place was packed one evening when we walked by, so we new it had to be good."
"We went for lunch, and had a spectacular meal."
I highly recommend any fish they happen to be serving.
"We had the John Dory and the sea bass--both were wonderful, and of the quality I would expect in a michelin 1 or 2 star restaurant."
"This restaurant was given as a value restaurant in our AA guide book and it did not disapoint, infact it was excellent."
The food is tremendous and varied.
"It is not an extensive menu but of a reasonable size, which is a good thing when making choices, the wine list is good and reasonable."
To ensure a table with little waiting arrive before 9pm or earlier in summer.
Book if you can to avoid disapointment.
It is just of the Ramblas and well worth any wait.
This was our favourite restaurant in Barcelona and will certainly be back to it on our next visit.
I am fortunate to go to Aiguafreda each summer...My family and I always enjoy the food and service at Hostal Rascassa.
Owner Oscar is fluent in many languages and is always happy to explain the menu....
Fantastic restaurant....
"Expensive food for a very lousy ambience, very average food."
500 ml of San Miguel costs 8 Euros !!
Tapa Tapa was 100 times better than this.
Felt thoroughly robbed off by the restaurant.
"I went to this place tonight with my wife and it was one of the worse places in the world...it WAS NOT tapas...or even good spanish food... the bread was dry, the menu selection was confusing...my wife ordered their seafood/chicken pella....tasted like cardboard...I orderd small fish, potatoes in spanish sause and spicy suasage."
when it arrived at my table i was horried... the fish were like small dry pieces of ash...the potatoes were like diced chips with orange looking mayo on it - No spanish sause here!...and the sausage!
I might as well have gone to a chip shop in england for better sausages!!!
and they came with fries!
spanish my behind... and then the cost came up to 43euros!!!!
horrible night....
I would have rather eaten mcdonalds!!!
it would have been more spanish!
I went to dine out with my friends to the said restaurant about a week ago.
After ordering drinks and food a basket of bread was delivered.
"After a brief inspection we discovered that one slice of bread had mold on it and the other had small holes in it as if some other guest had chipped away some pieces, without any doubt the bread was reused."
"We turned the waiter's attention to that appaling fact, he took the bread, didn't say a word and then he was gone."
Such a horrid dining experience has never happened in my life.
"Needless to say,we quickly finished our drinks and left the restaurant without paying."
"In any case, stay away!"
After a great evening of 6 Nations rugby at an Irish Bar we walked down to the port in search of a great end to a great Saturday in Barcelona.
"The charming black doorman did his job in enticing us with the 'free wine' trick, and stupidly, being soooo hungry, we fell for it."
"What followed was a dreadful meal with the traditional Paella, which was lacking in seafood and had what can only be described as a nasty tang."
"Other meals included a veal steak which was served on the bone and tasteless, and a Port Vell salad which didn't state it included lumps of raw fish."
The waiter was pleasant but a bit 'lost'.
"The owners appeared from time to time, scary looking people, and the chef, well, all I can say is that his appearance mirrored his food."
Overall about 40 Euros each (which with the Euro at parity is not a cheap meal) and genuinly we would have been better at MacDonalds.
"Incidentally, my sister-in-law was ill on the plane coming home, and my wife has lost work today suffering with her stomach."
My advice - DO NOT EAT HERE!!
"Oh - the free drink came at the end of the meal, a reasonable glass of Cava."
Situated in the corner of the main town square.
We ate here on two consecutive evenings.
It was surprisingly busy (on Sunday & Monday evening in February) which suggests that it has a good reputation!
We enjoyed an excellent meal (superb fish main courses) both evenings.
"Service was good, and we thought it was good value for money."
"In a side street in the Gothic quarter, not that easy to find but worth the effort, is this jewel of a restaurant."
"Our family of 6 adults ate there on 18 March and we had a great night, can't recommend it enough."
"It is quite small, maybe 12 tables, has an appealing decor and a welcoming ambience."
The food was superb.
My veggie eldest son had a succession of tapas dishes and declared them the best he had ever eaten.
Then there were lamb and beef dishes cooked to perfection followed by chocolate concoctions which had us drooling.
What got this place 5 stars from me was the attitude of the staff.
"For example, we asked for a cheese board which was not on the menu."
The waiter was taken aback but said he would see what he could do and 5 minutes later we had a selection of excellent cheeses on the table.
This is what it's all about.
When you spend good money you are entitled to expect good service and this place delivered in spades.
"Surrounded by other tapas bars in Plaza Santa Marta, this one stands out because of the decor (all about bullfighting) and the waiters' outfits (dressed as matadors)."
The food is good too - a great range of more unusual fair - and the service brisk and cheerful.
They even had toy bulls for sale when we last went.
"Real Spanish food, just excelent overall.... after the other reviews it gets I have nothing else to say."
I will go again and again and again...
"I have similar experiences to a traveller from London, went to dine out with a couple of friends about a week ago."
A very nice waiter approached us and without giving us the menus asked what would we like to eat.
We had a taste for paella de mariscos which we soon ordered.
"We couldn't decide on a wine so we asked for a menu card and promptly chose one, while I quickly glanced over the prices of the mains."
Paella de mariscos was around 13e which I consider for Barcelona a very decent price.
When the paella arrived it had half a lobster for every person on the table.
"Admittedly, it was one of the best paella I had in my life but the bill quickly brought us down to reality, it turned out to be 30 euros per person only for paella, not 13."
"Because I consider this an awful service and a blatant rip-off I will probably never go there again, nor will recommend this place to anybody."
"After a recommendation from relatives, we decided to book a table for our first night in Barcelona, looking forward to sampling some local cuisine and their famous fresh fish."
"We were really craving some prawns and fresh fish, as we saw them served at a nearby table."
We asked the waiter for a recommendation (the worst mistake) initiating the biggest rip-off experience of our life!
"I can't even blame it on language barriers as I am nearly fluent in Spanish, perhaps my naivety, in not asking the price of what we were about to eat."
I just didn't see it coming.
"I thought the charming service reflected the Mediterranean attitude towards life and passion for food, not a kniving façade that masks a typical tourist trap."
"So by the end of it, the massive dent was not only left in my bank account but in my pride too!"
And having blown the entire budget for the weekend we had to eat sandwiches for the rest of the holiday!!
"I've ordered a bottle of Cava to start, the one chosen never made the table but instead, as by magic, a more expensive bottle was brought forward, alarm bells should have gone off... Then I asked for a fish recommendation, a massive plate of prawns was produced and a very nice fish, all to be shared between the two of us."
"Once it arrived, well, it very tasty, the prawns were far less but I thought that maybe they were showing us all the prawns they had!"
We then had two lemon sorbets and some small samples of local cakes (amazingly enough complimentary of the house).
"As I asked for the bill, I also asked for a taxi and unfortunately they arrived together, giving me very little time to react to the horrific realization of the bill produced in front of me: €235!"
plus the audacity of the waiter to point out that the tip wasn't even included but our taxi was waiting!!!
"The plate of prawns that they showed us to start with, (which looked like the kilo we were at the end charged for) must have been full of live ones, as their great escape from the plate produce to the table later on, can be the only non-incriminatory excuse for receiving half of the amount we had to pay for!"
"€96 for 14 prawns, €88 for a fish, €10 for 2 miniscule lemon sorbets, all of which left us with a very bitter taste and a sleepless night after; food-poison would have produced less damage!"
"One of those situations when you can only think of what you should have said way too late, when you spend the night thinking, tossing and turning, fuming... then the epiphany... Trip Advisor: no-one else should be ripped off again in this restaurant!"
Mmmm... BBQ Ribs!!!
!
"As with most restaurants, more expensive doesn´t mean more tastey."
Rani does the best Indian that I´ve eaten in Barcelona and for a great price!
The waiters are very attentive and are very concerned with making sure that the food is up to your standards.
"Although it looks like they robbed a party store for decorations, the atmosphere is very nice."
"Low Indian music playing in the background, along with a mix of locals and Indians enjoying dinner."
I definatly recommend it for a great Indian meal!
"El millor japonés de Barcelona, sense dubtes."
"Not much of a negative nature to call at Davids The food is excellent value for money, the staff have time to chat and the booze flows freely."
"Having French owners, the food is of a far better quality than its Brit counterparts and the whole menu is fresh and tasty."
They do well from tourists who have sampled the attrocious Curry Club opposite and want something decent.
Highly recommended.
"We went with the idea of lunch in the Ra next door on March 16 and, dead on our feet, were put off by the long queue so decided to take a chance on this place, which had free tables (should have rung warning bells)."
Service was slow and one of the waitresses was particularly surly.
"They brought us the wrong thing twice and the ""mousse"" was a soggy mess which I sent back (and wasn't charged for)."
"Price is reasonable but if you're hungry, the portions aren't very big."
The food next door looked much more interesting and the waiters were smiley and chatty and the menu had much more choice.
"We have four cats, so we loved the name of this restaurant."
We ate here our first night in Barcelona with another couple.
We're all Americans with a very basic grasp of Spanish.
"Not a friendly greeting when we walked in and we sat in the waiting area, debating whether or not to leave."
"The main eating area is quite impressive, but also very, very loud and busy."
"My food was nothing to write home about and a bit overpriced, but it was a mainly enjoyable dining experience, especially since this is one of the few non-smoking restaurants in Barcelona."
Cool cups and plates that you can buy as souvenirs.
"Bags of atmoshere, and it was quite obvious everyone was having a good time."
"Nicely attired waiters who were very attentive, helpful and amusing."
Food (custard to die for!)
and drink were good and reasonably priced.
Restaurant very busy during our visit - justifiably so.
Very good rather old-fashioned food without being exceptiuonally adventurous.
Perfectly correct service and very welcome pianist all evening.
Excellent atmosphere - recommended.
"Last week I visited this place in Calle Princesa, I was quite sceptic about the possibility to have a good bowl of noodles in Barcelona, but UDON got it."
Very good food quality and a friendly service made our meal very pleasant.
Udon in broth is really a must to try and the rolls made with noodles are delicious.
"If you are around and need a good, fast and price valued meal UDON is highly recommended."
"Nice location and a place which appears attractive from the outside, went there a week ago... and left after 15 minutes !"
"The service is more than poor, the place mostly staffed by chineses employees who hardly can speak english, spanish and probably anything else and clearly do not care."
"Food equally terrible, we got nearly frozen ham, cold pastas and uncooked meat... when mentionned to the staff, they simply took it back to the microwave, came back with the same plate boilling... and even worse !"
"Finally the atmosphere is terrible.. seems to attract all stupid, poorly educated, noisy... tourists of the city."
My only recommendation: avoid this place like plague !
"Go anywhere else, you can get much better in Barcelono for the same price"
"We went to this restaurant in 2005, came back to Tenerife in 2008 so looking forward to eating there again but it was closed for renovations."
seriously considering going back to Tenerife for a weekend just to eat here.
I had Salmon which was fab.
Service and atmosphere are brilliant.
Go here to eat!
!
modern restaurant overlooking the port/harbor area.
"Fantastic views out to the sea, outdoor dining on decking in the summer.Very good quality food,almost fine dining standard.We had a three course set menu(during winter) which was excellent value, though a la carte would have been a little pricey,though worth it."
"Professional,attentive staff."
This is my third visit here and am never disapointed.
The meat is unbeatable and served with some nice wines.
I really enjoyed the Pampa mix starter and followed with a steak complemented with a rioja reserva.
All well presented and served by the english speaking waiter.
I agree with Trixiebelle27 - the portions of the bar menu were minute!
I was expecting more from the place especially at teh prices they charge!
We ordered burgers from the Bar menu and literally got a bun with meat!
No side salad (is it too much to ask?)
and when we asked for chips - the only chips they had was potato chips!
I have no idea what sort of concept they are trying to influence - but I suggest yopu go somewhere else to eat (unless you have a very very very small appetite!)
What a disapointment!
"Lovely restaurant, and great to get away from the commercial centre."
"The Chef is clearly passionate, and the food was just so delicious and beautifully presented."
"The prices are extremely reasonable considering the standard, and the ambience of the place is lovely."
Old fashioned but tastefully done.
"The service could be better, slow due to a lack of staff, rather than the relaxed canarian way."
Definately a must visit.
Reservations recommended as it is only small place and if you want the leg of lamb you need to order it the day before.
"Aruma was recommended to my girlfriend & I so we eagerly made the journey from Playa Blanca to sample the much hyped menu, all I can say is that it was a massively over priced disappointment."
"My starter was a plate of approximately a dozen clams, tasted nice but not worth 18.50 Euros, my girlfriends plate of grilled veg weighed in at a hefty 11.50 Euros."
My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed her main course of chicken however my fillet steak was extremely chewy!
"The service started off ok but there was only us and 1 other table dining at the time, as soon as a number of Spanish diners arrived we were largely ignored for the rest of the evening."
"this resturante is the best , you have to try it ."
jason
"when traveling through Spain or France, I often find that you go into a town and around lunchtime (2-3pm in Spain), the town is completely dead... until you find the restaurant where everyone goes for lunch."
"Casa Paca is it - a great atmosphere, everything prepared with care and with excellent ingredients."
"With our cervezas we had two pinchos (morcilla con queso de cabra y jamon) and for lunch we had a watercress, sweetbreads and jamon de pato salad, the peppers stuffed with rabo de toro and then costillas de cabracito."
Just what I needed.
"Very understaffed, dinner took over 2 and half hours with a 3 year old, waiters were very poor, easily the worst place we went to in this resort."
The menu del dia was great value and the food was very good.
Having it at the bar will save you a few euros (vs at a table).
The (very large) menu is a combination of a classic French menu and some classic Spanish dishes.
"Not very creative, but sufficient."
"Definitly one of the better restaurants in the Javea region, but it has to be said that most of the other restaurants in the region are serving mostly ""tourist menus"", while Masena is a ""Fine Dining""."
The ambiance is great.
"From spring to fall there is a (roofed) terrace, the tables inside are only used when exceptionally busy during this time of year."
The ambiance is classy and classic all year round.
Staff is efficient and friendly.
"Quality of food is good, prices are high for the region but reasonable all together."
"There really isn't much to complain about, but there is something about this restaurant that makes you think they're missing something."
"Expectations are usually met, but never surpassed."
Dress smart-casual.
"We went there in February and it was freezing inside, when they switched on the heating we couldn't hear each other because of the fan, ordering the food took ages, and we had to change order twice because they had supposedly ""run out"" , and we found out, after waiting for a long while that they were actually getting the plates from a different restaurant!"
"Apparently the cook hadn't shown up but they had decided to stay open.... Well situated but that's a trap, avoid!"
This restaurant was recommended to us by the staff at the hotel.
We had an excellent meal and the service was first-class.
We tried the Valencian paella which was E16 per head.
"Although you have to wait about 40 minutes while it is cooked, it was well worth the wait."
We tried some local Valencian white wine which was also very good.
It was obvious that the restaurant owners are real gourmets which is reflected in the menu and extensive wine list.
"We were told to make reservation, which we did, but actually we could have just turned up."
"If you want a really good, authentic meal in nice surroundings this is the place for you!"
I have been visiting santa ponsa for many years and always go to el ceibo.
food is beautifully cooked by juan and the sevice is brilliant .
you need to book in the evening
A romatic night at this reataurant will stay in your memory for a long time!
"We tried the winter menu which included 2 apertizers, 3 starters, 1 fish dish, 1 meat dish, pre-dessert and dessert."
Everything tasted delicious and was presented in a way that made every dish look like a small piece of artwork.
The somelier did a great job in finding us a terrific red wine and the staff in general were highly professional.
"It`s a bit outside the city centre, so I recommend to take a taxi to get there"
"This is NOT the place to go for a romantic date- it is bright, loud, and bustling- but these are all things that recommend it it in it's own way."
They do a really comprehensive seafood menu- it is a great place to go for cañas of beer and seafood tapas.
It's located on a square with a few swings and slides etc in the centre so a great place if you are dining with children and want to linger at the table!
These are the tapas bars i return to during a trip to barcelona.
It is a minchain of 4-5 restaurants.
"The one at placa de pi was most to my liking, but I also enjoyed the on just of santa maria del mar."
"Great tasty food, emphasize on seafood but also meatdishes are great."
The menu doesn't offer a lot of choice but the food here is absolutely delicious.
"I went with group of 8, none of us vegetarian, but we really enjoyed the meal."
"The desserts, however, were a big letdown; I wasn't even able to finish my lemon pie, because of how insipid and plasticky it was."
"The steaks are the best in Spain, maybe all of Europe, and the side dishes are incredible as well, Try the four-cheese ravioli."
"Remember that they have misinterpreted Fillet as ""sirloin"", so if you order the sirloin you are actually getting the top-cut of beef."
"The atmosphere is friendly and cozy, and the wines are worth a try."
it helps to know a little Spanish.
"Straightforward tasty food served in a brightly lit dining room seating about 25, served by one waiter."
Any people picking up on that this is a tourist trap don't go...don't go!
I live in Barcelona and a few less tourist trying to get in would be nice for me.
This place is for foodies.
Those that want to be dazzled by exceptionally cooked food with exceptionally sourced ingredients.
The service has to be the best for people who love their food and want to be steered down the right path.
I have eaten there over 20 times and each time they bring me new things.
I could write so many different dishes as recommendations.
The truth is its a pleasure going with the flow and letting them hit you with a mixture of dishes...its always good.
Simple cooked food done to perefection.
It is not cheap but you get what you pay for and I always leave with a big smile on my face and a full stomach and don't regret a single Euro....50 Euros a head to fully experience Cal Pep.
But I find most really good meals are around that.
The best tapas in Barcelona.
Pep is the leader!
It is INSULTINGLY overpriced for nothing.
They charge what you would pay in a 5 star restaurant only u sit at a disgusting bar with people screaming.
Its not charming nor is it interesting.
It is aggrivating.
The food is average at best.
"You leave eithe naseous or hungry, and feel financially raped."
DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT this.
It was maybe good ince upon a time but now it is just a sucker trap.
Spent the last night of our holiday at Oscars.
"We didn't book, as it was midweek, but the restaurant was fully booked inside."
"We were invited to dine outside which, in view of the usual windy conditions in Lanzarote, would not have been our first choice, but it was lovely."
The patio was totally windproof with a lovely atmosphere and we had a great evening with wonderful food.
"Prices are slightly higher than the norm in the local area but well worth the extra, 2 course meal for 4 with wine under £100, so can't be bad."
Service was attentive but unobtrusive.
"Excellent restaurant, food was very good and the price also!"
"the place is great inside in the design of a cave, the staff were friendly but be warned it's really popular and they want you in and out as quickly as possible other than that it was great."
Felt the traditional menu was overpriced for the quality of the food.
No locals were eating there.
Disappointing.
"Was recommended this restaurant by the Hilton hotel staff, as one of the best restaurants in the city for paella and frequented by natives."
"The location inspired confidence: on the Moll D'Espanya, opposite the main marina, similar to St Katherine's Docks in London or the Albert Docks in Liverpool, the silver service was begrudging - the staff weren't at all rude, just indifferent - as if being there was a chore."
"...as did the prices (EUR 78 for lobster) would make you think that if they're confident enough to charge those fees, the food must be worth it, right?"
WRONG.
The food tasted a little salty and I had my doubts about the freshness of the shellfish but shrugged it off as being less than expected.
"Having spent 24 hours between the bed and the bathroom - violently sick, our weekend break was ruined."
The doctor's prognosis back home?
"FOOD POISONING: V. CHOLERAE BACTERIA (typically from contaminated/raw shellfish) Before writing this review and potentially damaging a person's business, we've absolutely ruled out every other possibility - eating elsewhere, climate, medicine, etc and it could only be this restaurant."
SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND HEADACHE - FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT AND NEVER LISTEN TO YOUR HOTEL'S ADVICE!
In fact this is my favorite restaurant anywhere.
"Reservation definitely needed, and if you are planning on even one night in Madrid, make a reservation now."
"The house wine is perfect, a bottle sits on every table at the start of the night."
"The service was attentive, a rarity in Spain."
"My huevos dish (green beans, mushrooms, baby shrimp) was one step above the best I had previously had across spain, the white been stew was a special on the day I was there and I feel lucky."
I think they only offer it one day because it takes a full week to simmer.
And the Churrasco on the sizzling plate was both delicous and fun to prepare.
"I ate fine dining in Madrid, tapas in Madrid, and at the worlds oldest restaurant (nearby Botin) but without a doubt, Casa Lucio was a step above."
I even spent two nights in paris this trip and Casa Lucio was better than fine dining in Paris.
Chef Nizar is one of my favorite restaurant: I absolutely loved their Lebanese starters.
"They are also known to have the best lamb in Lanzarote (if you book in advance you can order dishes which are not on the menu, ask the waiter to help you with your choice)"
"we decided to try this place due to the reports on tripadviser and we were not disappointed, the food was fantastic and very good value for money only 4.95 euro, starter,main,rice or noodles,ice cream or tea or coffee with lager or wine, what a bargain if you like chinese food then you will love the china garden"
"the rudeness of the tall waiter is unreal he does not even look at you when he is taking your order but if you are lucky the mum will serve you.the food is ok and the menu is good but why it is so busy is beyond me.they also put a reserved sign on all spare tables when they are not even reserved.but even after sayig all this i still visit once a year just to see if the sons attitude has changed,it never does"
"This club-restaurant looks like a factory... after being ""pushed"" inside by two hostesses, you'll meet tired and unfriendly waiters asking you to hurry up...  Defenitely NOT the best place to enjoy sunny Barcelona!"
Such a disappointment!
Over-priced cold food and pretentious waiting staff.
We've had better chipirones at beach bars!
€13 !
"A cold shoulder of kid smothered with packet-tasting, glutenous sauce."
Yuk!
"OK, we had already read the reviews here but little could we expect what we found."
"Tiny rather than little, this restaurant had everything we were looking for at a reasonable price, not cheap though."
We recommend the surprise menu but everything we saw at the other tables seemed excellent as well.
Very conveniently located at the Gracia district so you can enjoy some drinks after dinner.
"Almost forgot, the service was excellent, which is a great plus in the area."
"Don't get me wrong, we love Barcelona but a good service is not always guaranteed and in this case it was NEAT."
After reading all the good reviews about this restaurant I decided to make a reservation and me and my friend went up there.
It's a really small restaurant with only 8 tables so the atmosphere is pretty private.
There is one swedish manager and one waiter (Spanish).
We were helped by the Spanish waiter and he is really nice.
We decided to try the 5 courses surprise menu.
"The first course was a soup with foie gras (never ate it but tasted good), the second course was a crab carpaccio with some spicey sauce (the taste was quite strong so we couldn't eat everything); the third course was white fish (I forgot which one and what came along with it); the fourth course was some really tender beef with lentils in teriyaki/balsamico sauce (wow tasted really good) but then the desert came and that really was heaven on earth."
I ate it with my eyes closed because I was enjoying it so.
It was the perfect chocolate souffle with some coconut foam to along with it (I don't realy like the tast of coconut but this was sooo good).
If you like wine I could recommend the white Chardonay from New Sealand.
"We just asked for a white wine, bit sweet and not dry and this one was great."
"Also our waiter was so nice, he explained us everything, asked if everyhting was ok (but not too often)."
We felt like two princesses because of the way we were treated.
This really is the best restaurant in Barcelona.
"Only one little point, we don't know if the Swedish manager and the Spanish waiter didn't like each other or that the Swedish manager didn't feel like working that night but he was incredibly cranky."
We didn't found that very professional because we really could feel the tension (since it's such a small restaurant) although he was trying to hide it.
We were really happy the Spanish waiter helped us.
Thanks again!
We have been to this restaurant on a few occasions .Our most recent visit was last week Like most of the other reviews we also had the surprise menu which we really enjoyed from start to finish .
We will have no problem recommending Con Gracia to any of our friends that visit Barcelona  Couple ;Ireland;
One of the best meals we've had.
"Not cheap, but worth every cent!"
"Forget everything you know about tapas - I love the traditional cerverceria-style tapas bars that are understated and littered with locals because the food is honest and clean, but 'Con Gracia' is a food experience."
The young chef and multi-lingual sommelier are passionate about the food and drink and it shows.
"We put ourselves in their hands and opted for the 6 course menu, each one a surprise chosen by the host with a wine to complement each course's flavour."
"We were so impressed, we called the next day to ask the name of a red & a white - we brought a couple of each home with us."
"We've been lucky to eat at some beautiful restaurants, but this one's a gem and shouldn't be missed if you're in Barcelona."
"The place could do with a splash of colour and livelier background music to relieve some of the tension in the atmosphere, but perhaps some of the guests were giving off that vibe, as the staff couldn't do enough to please (without fussing)."
P.S.
"they'll never compliment the chef, just to keep him trying hard!"
"This was without doubt the most fantastic meal I have ever enjoyed ,It was Booked for a special occasion and it certainly stepped up to the mark ."
"We had the chefs surprise selection and the wine tasting option and it became not just a culinary education but also 3 hours of entertainment as well , the staff are friendly and approachable and do their utmost to make you feel welcome ,all questions were answered patiently and with a genuine enthusiasm for their craft ."
Quiet and intimate ( they only seat about 20 ) it was a perfect evening and although the bill was on the high side I truly considerer it worth every penny .
Had a great evening at this tiny restaurante last week.
You could choose from 2 diffrent tasting menus each with it´s wine pairings.
The food was original and of highest quality.
The wines were perfectly match and explained.
"Service was attentive, knowledgeable and most importent: they could explain in perfect english what we were eating and drinking."
Highly reccomendable to reserve with some time as they only seat between 18-22 people.
"dined at con gracia last night with my girlfriend... long story short, it was quite literally the best dining-out experience i've ever had (and i dine out quite often)."
every aspect of the experience was impeccable.
"like all the other reviews, i'll highly recommend the surprise menu along with the wine tasting menu."
it's a 5-course meal with a new glass of wine for each.
the food...dear lord...it made me want to cry.
i'm serious.
"the final bill was hefty, but i have no regrets whatsoever and i'm already excited about going there again."
An abolutely fabulous little restaurant in the heart of Gracia in Barca.
"Exquisitely prepared and presented food, fantastic array of flavours."
"Amazing wine selection , and super efficient and friendly service."
Superb.
We LOVED this restaurant.
We chose it because it was rated number one on trip advisor...and the reviews were right!
The restaurant is beautiful.
They take a lot of care in every detail.
We went here on our last night in Barcelona.
"It was honestly the kind of ""make you want to cry"" experience...it was THAT good."
We did the chef's surprise menu and did the accompanying wine pairing.
We loved every minute of our time there and the staff made it that much more of a great experience.
They were definitely the nicest restaurant staff we met out of all of the restaurants we visited on our trip.
You really must go there.
We booked this restaurant on the basis of reviews seen on other sites.
It was held out to be Seville's finest but was in fact from that.
"We arrived at 8:40, 10 minutes after the restaurant was due to open."
It was empty of diners but also of staff.
after a while the maitre'd walked in and then walked out again.
After another few minutes nother employee walked in and showed us to our table.
The setting was fairly grand and rather ornate.
The prices were high (around 26 Euros for a main course) but the quality of the food did not qualify for such prices.
It was strangly dated in its concept and presentation.
The portions were overly large (not a complaint) but the food did not have the fine flavours we now associate with quality cooking.
In summary - disinterested staff serving rather uninteresting food at excessive prices.
"You can't really expect too much when eating out in Barcelona, and this restaurant held to tradition."
"The food was ok, nothing special at all ."
The dessert however made up for the lack of dinner flavor!
Their cheesecake and chocolate cakes are DELICIOUS!
By far the best dessert I've eaten in Barcelona.
"It was also very tastefully decorated, prices were reasonable, service was good and it had a romantic atmosphere"
"Good quality food, but a very small restaurant, few tables, people very packed and the place gets stuffed with smoke."
The prices are way too high.
Try the duck magret - it's really good!
Reservations are a must in this atmospheric restaurant.
"Been there three times in four days, once just for some patatas baravas & cervezas."
"Very authentic place, great food and ice-cold beers is what you should expect."
What you shouldn't expect is high prices and fancy luxurious decoration.
"The bar is lively, with hams hanging from the ceiling and people chatting."
This is not one of those touristic tapas bars where you get to eat frozen or lame food.
beautiful place nice food and friendly service.
That is one of the best beach club restaurant on the coast.
Beautiful swimming pool and gardens .
Very unusual tables .
The quality (and quantity) of the three Course-mid day meny incl wine is the best I've had for under 10 euros in Barcelona (been to about 50).
"The desserts are a bit disappointing, but you don't really need one after the two abundant previous courses, so just order a ice-coffee (cafe con hielo) instead."
Feeling like lunch we gave La Concha a try for the menu del dias.
"The place was busy with locals, which as someone else said, is always a good sign."
"I think we were the only tourist there, but were made to feel welcome and the 3 course meal for 9 euros including a carafe of Vino Tinto was very tasty and excellent value."
"It was 13:30, just opened and it was still dirty."
"They accidentally hit our 3 yo kid with a broom, 4 of the stuff starred at us dumbly, kid was crying, no one even cared to say ""sorry""."
"Just don't go there, find a place where you are respected as customer!"
"We have eaten at Vino Mio on a number of different occaisons over the last couple of years, including new years' eve, and have always been very happy with the quality of the food and the very friendly staff, especially Helen, the proprietor."
We will certainly be going back there again this summer and would reccomend it to anyone
went back to this restaurant every nite.
sad i know but when u get what u want who cares.
good food my husband particulary liked the mixed grill.
friendly atmosphere.
friendly staff.
still good value 3 of us could eat for 25 euros.
Loved it and spent 2 of our 4 nights in this place.
This City is famous for a number of gastronomical delights fulfillng a broad range of tastes both good and bad.
"Really enjoyed La Luna as the food was yummy, my husband devoured his stake and declared it better than his mothers which I am told is some feat."
After dinner the place started to truly come alive as nocturnal living spanish style kicked in.
They eat very late here and come out to play circa 11.00 or so.
This place was really very enjoyable and the staff friendly.
"Always busy, fab tapas, great cocktails and funky sounds a great place to meet people too"
"Excellent restaurant in the heart of PDC, beside the shopping centre."
"Good quality, tasty food at reasonable price."
"Nice, friendly staff."
"Advisable to book in advance during the Summer, as the restaurant is quite small and does get v busy, off peak months normally okay to get a table."
The duck is highly recommended.
Only fault is wine list could be better.
"nice place to go for a coffe, not for a meal."
Dishes are nice but not great and too expensive
We went to Corralejo on a family holiday for two weeks in Jan 2009 my husband myself and two teenage sons.
We fancied a nice sunday dinner and boy were we glad we ate it at 5th Avenue.
It opens at 12pm to start serving we all had a 2 course prices at 10 euros a 3 course is12.50 euros.
What can I say food was absolutely delicious three of us had lamb one beef beautiful home made food including stuffing sauces home made as well and different gravy depending on meat.
"The sweets were all home baked too and served up as you would find in a top restaurant, excellent choices and we tried a bit of each others as were all so good."
Lovely atmosphere very clean gentle background music and very helpful lady that cooks and serves.
A quick service too 10/10
"no words can be wrote about this restaurant, simply outstanding from start to finish."
"chicken with coca cola (yes coke out of a can) langoustine (prawn) acquapazze (garlic)  fillet manhatten (steak/black pudding) whistle stop entrecote (steak and cheese sause) and simply the best chocolate and fresh orange cheese cake, goat cheese and olives and finished with a homemade chocolate, we ate their twice early evening it gets busy late but if you had to wait i would, service and staff first class."
"taking the time to explain how the food is prepared and cooked, this happened with my fillet manhatten not to sure on steak and how it should be cooked this was an outstanding meal."
"just gutted we could not make it on the friday night, this place is a must on any visit to corralego."
thank to the staff for two outstanding meals in this gem of a place
"Stayed in Nerja for 7 nights, and went to Pepe's 4 of 7 dinners!"
The food was excellent.
"Best gambis pil-pil I have ever had, had it every time."
"The portions were HUGE, and the fish was fabulous."
"Great value for your money, the house red wine..."
FANTASTIC.
"The staff was welcoming, friendly, and I can't wait t go back there next year!"
My husband and I make sure we dine here at least once during our stays in Barcelona.
This wonderful little gem in the center of Gracia is a delight and entirely affordable.
"It is not a known tourist establishment, therefore you experience real Catalan cuisine in the midst of the locals."
The 'menu' for lunch is always delicious and comes at a great price.
"Typically, it includes a first dish, a second dish and dessert--also with wine/water and sometimes coffee."
My favorite dishes are the butifarra negro (blood sausage with pine nuts) or the potato with fois gras and mushrooms.
The 'little piggies of heaven' are my preferred dessert.
Such a great place and very authentic.
"Went into this restaurant for an evening meal on a whim, which paid off big time."
"Very pleasant staff, lovely quality food and prices were very reasonable."
Atmosphere was great and restaurant appeared to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.
"great ""arroz negro"""
This restaurant is hard to find and looks like an old yellow shack from the outside but after you step inside the small reception area your perception of the place is instantly changed.
It is the perfect place for a romantic liaison or special occasion.
The restaurant has some open plan seating but it also has secluded alcoves for more intimate occasions.
"In spite of the name which translates as 'The Beautiful Beach' I, personally, prefer the meat dishes."
If you like very strong garlic then the rack of lamb ribs has a deliciously thick garlic gravy and it takes a hearty appetite to finish the course.
Parking nearby can be difficult so it usually pays to arrive early.
"while out in fue decided to try fado rock indian restraunt boyfriend went straight to toilets when sat down,came back and said they was absolutely dirty and nasty not cleaned at all,so i was not letting the evening down decided to order our family meals.i had a curry like everyone else plus me & boyfriend had special fried rice."
"meal came after about 15mins,looked alittle nasty in my opion but started eating."
well my meal was absolutely disgusting never tasted curry like it & rice wasnt nice either.
"my son found something in his curry,which in my opion i should have complained but didnt,we just hate what we could got the bill & left."
"wouldnt go back there ever again,nasty food & nasty restraunt wasnt very clean neither."
Stay away from this restaurant .
Its filthy and staff are useless.
The food isnt even what i would consider average!
So disappointed as it was recommended highly on this site
this is on the beach just below the banana tree pub and restaurant.Your hosts are jackie and peter and Minolo.
"(Jackie does all the running around and Pete bosses her around-and does the odd bit of bbq-ing).Seriously,super service by great hosts.You lay on your sun beds and are treated like kings and queens,or you can sit at the bar or tables provided.Food and drink are brought to you so you dont even need to move.They are that accomodating you can have anything even if its not on the menu.Main meals and snacks are available.Everything is very reasonably priced for marbella and after experiencing the service and the laughs here,you wont want to sunbathe anywhere else.Jackie and Pete always remember who you are and a warm welcome is forthcoming.Highly recommend you use the beach here you wont regret it."
The restaraunt was very crowded but bright when we entered.
You have to place your order at the counter and you pick a seat when you get your order so be careful carrying your chocolate and churros.
There are two floors with one downstairs.
This restaraunts specialty is desserts.
"Favorite Dish: The churros are freshly made and are served with a cup of melted chocolate that can be used to dunk the churro or can be a drink, very very rich."
A friend of mine stumble across Si-Chuan and invited me to eat there with him.
I knew it was going to be a good meal when I saw that it was mostly Chinese people eating there.
"We had an assortment of different plates, including duck, beef, pork and chicken and every single one was fantastic!"
If you are a fine of spicy make sure you ask them to make one of the plates extra spicy... we did and it was the spiciest Chinese I've ever had.
Not to mention the prices are great!
Good Chinese restaurants in Barcelona are few and far between.
"So if you are looking for good Chinese, make sure you put Si-Chuan on your list!"
"Oops we made a mistake eating here apart from being full of English people a lot older than us, the food was not nice."
Unsurprisingly within the next 8 hours my husband & I were confined to our hotel room with D&V.
"If you are English,over 55 and don't like eating Spanish food by all means this is your place!"
Tremendous food created by an artiste.
Richard Anderson
"Bubo is one of the world's best cake shops, its beautiful creations laid out like fine jewellery in glass cases."
"Expensive, though a little cheaper than Cartier but the quality is the same ;) Chocolate is good too..."
Visited this modest restaurant twice and left the premises with a smile which lasted until I fell asleep.
Go there traveller and enjoy whatever choice your making.
Just been again for 3rd time on 4th trip to Palma (would have been 4th time but they were on holiday in July '07!).
"Have twice stuck to the tapas menu, which is excellent, but tonight ventured into full dish territory with the entrecote steak for two, which was fantastic (3rd best steak I've ever had...)."
"Restaurant is small and full of character, and clearly has a cast of 'regulars' judging by the reception given by the friendly owners."
Location is a little off the beaten track - but 3 minutes away from our apartment....!
Don't go to eat there : it is shapeless and tasteless...
"I have been to Meson O'Luar a few times, both in 2009 and 2008."
The restaurant is situated on San Bernardo - a large road that runs off Gran Via in the middle of town.
It is about 10min.
"walk from Plaza Espana, and about 5-7min walk from Hotel Atlantico in the other direction."
"It doesn't look very special from the outside with pics of the dishes, but the food is great."
The front of the restaurant is typically Spanish - bar counter where you can order tapas.
"There is a little TV in one corner and on the nights when the football is on, the bar is crammed with people eating, smoking, drinking and watching the game."
"Towards the back is a restaurant area, seating maybe about 10-15 tables."
The tables are well-spaced.
"Over 2 years, I have had dinner here about 4 times - and it has been great everytime."
Their boquerones fritos (fried anchovies) are some of the best we ate in Spain - so fresh and not greasy at all.
"They also do setas (big flat mushrooms) on the grill, grilled champinones (button mushrooms) with garlic oil and a wonderful paella de mariscos (seafood paella)."
"If you like calamari, order the grilled baby calamari, which is incredibly tender."
"Service is quite friendly by Spanish standards, and the guys were very patient with us getting through our traveller's spanish."
"If you are lucky, you'll get one of the guys who speaks a little English."
"Otherwise, the menu also contains English translations."
Price-wise it's incredibly good value - particularly within this touristy end of town.
We always ate fit to burst here and the bill was rarely more than 15e a person.
"Obviously this depends on what you order, but servings are quite generous."
The other great thing about Meson O'Luar is that the kitchen is open right throughout the day - no shutting between lunch and dinner service.
This makes it great for an early dinner or late lunch if you've had a full day of sightseeing.
Also great for families with kids that need to eat a little earlier.
Just back from a five day trip.
Enjoyed eating tapas for lunch but this was probably the best dinner we had in Seville.
"Ten of us enjoyed starters and mains from advocado prawns, bruchettas, mains pizza, pasta, fish and goat."
Three puds.
"380 Euros for 10, although we did have 6 or 7 bottles of very nice wine!!"
"The only thing we could complain about was the service, no time given to savour the meal."
As soon as our starter was finished plates were cleared and the main course arrived two minutes later.
Shame really as we did enjoy our meal
"Loved it, romantic, different, food was good, cocktails better than anywhere else in the world."
Just unique really but will never forget it..
"great food, great service and excellent value for money, love the cocktails, and the service"
"Young and good looking crowd, which would generally lead me to give a 5 star rating anyway, but the atmosphere in this place is spot on and the food was great - varied and authentic."
EXCELLENT COCKTAILS.
"Would recommend a visit, make your own mind up then!"
"Be to palma Nova twice and on both occassions ate here, the food is of very high quality and the seating area outside is lovely and relaxing."
The Salmon is to die for as are the steaks.
Out of all the restaurants in Palma Nova I didn't find it too child friendly and the prices are a little more expensive than the other restaurants around the area.
The staff could do with some training as to how to be friendly and helpful but overall I would recommend a visit and will be going back myself for the quality of food.
After looking unsuccessfully for three places listed in our lonely planet we came across El Cafeti by fortunate accident...
The place was excellent.
"Great traditional food, good atmosphere.. the deserts were divine!!!"
"The hostest made a big effort to recommend us the best dishes (not necessarily the most expensive, which was great as I am vegetarian) and we were given complimentary traditional desert wine to accompany deserts!"
Would definately recommend this place for when you get sick of eating patatas bravas and spanish omelette..
A lovely restaurant with attentive freindly staff in a lovely location overlooking the beech.
maybe a little pricier than some of the other nearby resaurants but in my opinion worth it
Excellent quiet and intimate restaurant situated in a back street of Estepona (near the South Eastern edge of the town centre) serving the very best steaks around in a very relaxing atmosphere.
The waiting staff were very helpful and polite and our food arrived at the table very hot indeed.
Entering Almunecar we parked our car in front of El Chaleco to ask for hotel directions and finding a place to do lunch.
Directions we got.
More importantly we enjoyed a great lunch with good value for our money.
Being Dutch is it great to be greeted in our own language (or Flemisch to be precise).
The Belgian owners prepared and serviced us an excellent lunch and gave us a great start of our Andalusian holidays.
Check out El Chaleco when you are in the Almunecar region.
You will not be disappointed.
We were searching the Barri Gothic area for somewhere to get a nice fillet steak & had looked at lots of menus before arriving here.
"We nearly didn't go in as it looked too upmarket & we were in jeans, & although not scruffy we felt a little out of place, but we discovered vey people inside were dressed up."
"On entering we were asked if we had a reservation - I was worried we might get stuck on a tiny table in a dark corner but we were led upstairs & given an excellent table on the balcony, which just made the evening."
We lingered long over our steaks & a good value Rioja from the cellar (12 Euros).
"My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, & had a delicious salty char-grilled crust."
Hubby's fillet with foie & Cabernet sauce was prefectly rare.
Although we had planned to go elsewhere for puddings we stayed on as we were enjoying the atmosphere so much & had delicious Creme Catalana mousse (see photo).
An upright piano played throughout the evening which was just lovely & not at all intrusive.
"The bill was about 72 Euros - that was 2 courses, bottle of wine, 2 cokes & a coffee."
Fair by Barcelona standards.
Booked the room in the cellar for a company lunch during Mobile World Congress.
"Fantastic atmosphere, great service and excellent food."
We visited this place 4 times for dinner during our stay.
We only found it by chance as it's tucked out of the way - but well worth the visit.
"A very cosmopolitan and laid-back environment, excellent food, top service."
Can't fault it!
I had dinner at this restaurant for the first time 2 nights ago and will definately be returning.
I opted for the Menu Degustation of 4 courses and every one of the courses was delicious.
To accompany the food I had the vino tinto de la casa (2 large glasses) which was rich and full of flavour - an ideal match for the food.
I finished off with a very good brandy and espresso and all this including an aperitif was under €50.
I dined quite early for Spain and by the time I left at around 9pm I was still the only customer.
Despite this the owner lit a roaring log fire for me (though it was really not required) and served me himself with great courtesy.
The restaurant is very attractive and has a smart rustic ambience.
It will be even better in the summer when dining on the very smart and attractive terrace is possible.
Definately one of my favourites in Moraira and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
"Nice atmosphere, and the locals are attracted to the place, so it looked promising."
"However, surly waiters, and dismal food left us unimpressed."
"From surly reception to cold, microwaved food this restaurant trip was a disaster."
No commitment from service or kitchen staff to any sort of standard.
Simply terrible.
- Dined there on a recent holiday to Tenerife.
- Service excellent & Staff very efficient.
- Atmosphere very good although it does suit an older clientele (who will end up dancing to the Live Musician as night progresses..!)
- Food a bit disappointing for such a nice Restaurant.
"My Partner had a medium peppered Fillet Steak (Sauce on side) which although medium is obviously pre-cooked, I think as it's such a busy place a lot of their food is pre-cooked before it gets busy."
I had a Veal Chop which was excellent & obviously cooked to order.
- We would return but would be a bit more careful in what we order.
*They have a great Restaurant here with so much going for it but I feel they do need to get their act together in their kitchen.
We went with a group of seven guys.
Got a great table with a big window overlooking the street.
"Service was very good from start to end, 2-3 waiters were taking care of us all night."
One of them spoke perfect English.
"With aperitifs we got great amazing appetizers, the entrees were good and the main courses delicious."
We also got a great wine recommendation.
"All in all, a very good price-quality ratio."
The bill was about 500euro for the whole evening.
The only thing we didn't get were cigars :-(
Have been there twice last week.
"Lovely service by Pia, tremendously delicous food, good wine selection which is priced very reasonably."
Was our favourite restaurant.
Another interesting place is Skina.
Will definately come back.
"Pile it high on the plate kind of place, without really giving any quality."
"Pretty forgetable dining, though they do have an outdoor garden for the summer."
Stick to Tortilla and Salad.
JLR score: 22/50
The most stylish pizzeria!
Superb Tapas Bar located in Spain's best Medieval town.
Good atmosphere and excellent menu.
JLR Score: 40/50
"quite exclusive and expensive but worth it on all accounts (cocktail bar, restaurant)"
"another Finca d Susana & co: great price-quality, decent portions, nothing too fancy, pleasant decor, indifferent staff"
good for decent tapeo or fancier dining inside or in the climatized tent-terrace.
"Great pulpo and lubina al sal, meats tasty too, quality products all round and just 100 metres from my doorstep :-)"
"great cochinillo (and other asados), impressive 1700-something building, Sunday-Madrid-escape recommendation"
I found this place well overrated.
Wated for a long time and found service quite poor.
"Tried the classic eggs and the ""rabo de toro"" stew, and none were particularly special."
"No reasons to go back, a few reasons to stay away."
Lovely views from the roof-top dining area.
"Standard Italian fare, but with big portions."
Puddings best left alone.
JLR Score: 23/50
The service and friendly nature of all the staff just makes you feel so much at home it's a joy to visit.
"My wife and I have been going to the restaurant for 3 years now and will be visiting very soon, several times between 25th May & 6th of June this summer."
If this is put up on a display of any sort we have no objections whatsoever.
My calling name for  future reference is TIGER and the staff will remember us.
"We are really looking forward to our next visit, very soon."
"Closing now,   TIGER."
"This is my favourite restaurant - I've been with my husband for romantic dinners, the children for family meals and girlfriends for girly nights."
It's candle-lit which gives a lovely atmosphere and the steaks are the best I've had.
Every time I visit Marbella I always come to this restaurant and tell friends to visit too!
This review is ONLY FOR THE RESTAURANT AND NOT FOR THE ACCOMODATION as we only went for dinner.
"The location is about 20mins drive from Palma and the airport, but Majorca is best explored by car anyway so I would recommend hiring a car anyway."
"The views from the restauranta are beautiful, the restaurant decor is elegant, clean, with typical Spanish rustic looks."
"The food was delicious- marvelous layouts on your plate, quick at bringing the food out, delicately prepared food with all home-grown ingredients (as this is an ""agriturismo"" which means that all the food made is home-grown)."
"We took the ""degustacion menu"" and was 32€ for a 4 course dinner without wine or drinks, so so so worth it I would recommend it always."
"If I ever went back to Palma, I would DEFINITELY stay in the apartments as well as if they are as clean, elegant, well kept and attention to detail as the restaurant then we'd definitely be in for a treat."
"Oh, we also arrived at the restaurand over 40mins late as we got lost following the satnav (which i would suggest NOT to use!"
"Just follow the directions that the hotel provide) but the staff were very friendly and perfectly fine with this, still served us properly and politely."
Recommend this for people who want to experience proper Spanish cuisine and environment with the waitor who still spoke a bit of english so you could communicate if you did not know the lingo.
What an imaginative menu when most of the other restaurants are serving the same Spanish or Italian meals.
"No choice for a vegetarian, but the dishes on offer for each course were most enjoyable."
"We were told that if we booked in advance and requested a vegetarian meal, the chef would produce something different."
"Our only quibble was that the tax was not included in the menu price (it is in most restaurants).However, the usual (for Spain) €1.50 cover charge for bread here meant homemade tomato and fennel bread (different everyday) with butter, tapanade and olives."
Extra bread was also offered with the first course.
"A lively atmosphere and very friendly, helpful, attentive staff."
I note from your list that this restaurant is not included.
My wife and I went to this restaurant on April 1st 2009 to celebrate a friend's 65th birthday.
"Firstly the service was terrible, we waited some time for the waiter to request our drinks."
"My wife and my friend's wife requested a Rose off the list, they hadn't any in stock so they had a differnt one which they didn't like."
"My friend and I requested a red wine from the list, they hadn't got any so we had to choose a different one."
We ordered the meals.
My friend and I and my wife ordered fillet steak whils his wife ordered fish.
The fish was fine.
The steaks were very large.
My steak and my friend's cooked OK but not perfect.
My wife's was very rare despite her requesting very well done.
When she complained they took it back and eventually brought her another.
Still rare.
"She complained again, this time a different smaller piece was brought."
Still rare.
Another complaint and the same piece came back all cut up and burnt.
She was extremely upset and walked out crying.
They offered no apologies and charged us over £100 for 4 main courses and wine.
"After 8 years of visiting Maspalomas, this is the wost retaurant experience I have ever encountered and I would definately not recommend it."
Just out of interest a German couple sat next to us waited 40 minutes to pay the bill.
We made a reservation here to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday a couple of years ago on the recommendation of a friend.
"Wow, it was out of this world."
"The service, attention,but more than that the wonderful food."
"I was really impressed when we both ordered a starter and then the main course of fish platter (my husbands plain, and mine in lobster sauce) the waiter informed us that the size of the main meal we had ordered was quite large and possibly we would not require a starter."
How nice was that!
They could have just taken our money and let us leave some food.
I will certainly be going back again and cannot recommend this enough.
It definitely rates as one of my best meals on the island.
Lizarran in Seville is a must stop for tapas.
The bar has long cases and you go up and pick up what you want both hot and cold.
"In addition, the staff come by and bring plates of tapas for you to try if you want."
There is a wide selection of bite-sized tapas that are visually appealing and a delight to eat.
The food is excellent and very inexpensive for what you get in comparison to the rest of Spanish restaurants.
"Staff are pleasant and helpful, and the whole experience is a treat."
All tapas are expensive for a very poor quality.
It is obvious that product come out of cans or freezer.
Avoid the restaurant's wine and the catalana cream.
Gambas ajillo had a terrible taste of old oil.
"Pan con tomate does not seem to be a specialty of this ""typical spanish restaurant""!!!!"
The meal was inedible!!
!
Uns gelats bonissims!!!!!
!
We really enjoyed the meal we had at the poseidon and went back twice.
We were staying at Hotel Isabel and it was a short walk from there.
The food was very reasonably priced and i can recommend the fresh whole fish dihes.
The sangria was lovely and very reasonably priced compared to other places we went.
The staff were so lovely- the head waiter even introduced us to his family on the last night!
There's a nice outside area too which backs onto the beach- nice for evening drinks!
Overall i would recommend Poseidon for good food and friendly service!
I got this tip from Tripadvisor and yes it's true.
The food is great!
"It's not the typical tapas menu, its more international with a limited selection but what is there is fantastic."
I loved the veal cheek and the cod tempura.
It's the most fun I've had eating and standing (no chairs).
"Its not actually on 31 de Agosto, its on the alleyway where 31 de Agosto no.28 is."
"The restaurant is outside of Alcudia city center, but not far and definetely worth a few minutes by car."
"The restaurant is lovely, the food (Italian/international) really good, but the service was outstanding!"
"The waiters managed to keep at that perfect distance that makes them available all the time, but not annoyingly so."
They also had a set 3 course menu with a very reasonable price and combined with fabulous wines.
Will certainly come back next time we're in Mallorca!
"We visit this restaurant every time we are in Torrevieja, only for the shoulder of lamb they serve."
"The nice atmosphere and good food is destroyed by very bad service and waiters taking orders using electronic ""mini-PC-s"" and showing no sign of knowing the words ""atmosphere"" and ""service""."
I was a regular visitor some years ago to this restaurant but will never go again.
"I went yesterday with my family and apart from one friendly waitress, I met with two surly disinterested young waiters who proceeded to deliver a watery gazpacho and an inedible overcooked sole to my wife (returned to the kitchen with no charge made) but no apology given."
"The others in my party were given a burned pizza, overcooked rabbit and two steaks both closer to well done rather than the requested medium."
The price without the sole was 128 euros - no wine ordered one alocholic drink and the others had soft drinks.
Too big for thier boots
The best Cocido Madrileno that I have ever had!
I loved this place.
We arrived right before the lunch crowd and managed to squeeze in without reservations.
We enjoyed every bit of our meal.
I suggest this as a must for anyone who visits Madrid and wants to enjoy a really traditional meal.
the food is insanely good.
the staff and friendly and welcoming.
food gets out fast and is of extremely high quality.
beautifull flavours.
a well rounded menu.
i ate there most days of my holiday and the nights i didnt eat there i wished i had.
try the duck or the cam cran burger!
beautifull.
fantastic house wine and smoothies also.
it is set on the quieter side of the island which is nice for a relaxing meal.
check it out or you will regret it!
Have visited No8 Bar & Grill many times and have never been disappointed.
The burgers a re to die for - great names too!
Fish and Pasta delicious Mmmmm!
"Julian, Alex and Heidi are delightful and there welcome warm and sincere."
Fast becoming THE most popular eatery in Santa Ponsa so may have to book!
"Good on the eye, scrummy on the lips and not heavy on the pocket!"
Enjoy!
My partner and I always look forward to eating at Rimini (www.ristorantesrimini.com).
The food is always beautifully prepared and hot.
The pasta and pizza very authentic Italian and desserts wonderful.
THE SPORTSMAN  By far the best breakfast you can get!!
"we loved it, set us up for the day, the kids loved it to, we never tried the rest of the menu, but you cant beat the brekkie!!"
five star!
!
This was the best restaurant in our short stay...we visited several starred places including one 3 star but this was a different level.It is run by a family and the welcome and service was faultless.The food was as good as I have ever eaten and I have been to over 25 0f the top 50 Restaurants in the World.The Sommelier suggested a Finca Garbet 2003 which was great.If you can get in I would not consider anywhere else in Barcelona.
Had a meal here recently at it was an absolute gem.
It is hidden down a rather unprepossessing alley way but once inside it is stylish and very airy.
The food and service is just fantastic.
We had a carpaccio for starter which was unusually made with veal.
Very delicious.
For main course I had the carbonarra and my friend had the truffle pasta.
It was very delicious.
Afterwards we had pannacotta and tiramisu which were very good.
A bit annoyed that they didnt do side salads as we were starved of veggies but otherwise the whole meal was great.
Please make an effort to go.
I have been here a few times over the last few years and was expecting a pretty hefty bill this year as the Euro is steep for us UK visitors.
"We had the set menu for 35 euros and although I can't list it all (will take notes next time) It was all spectacular - bream roe with blackberry, strawberry Gazpacho and liver pate for a little amuse-bouche before we even started.. Langoustine Carpaccio with grated Foie gras and goats cheese, pan fried bream which was out of this world and we had duck for main as the suckling pig had all gone by the time our party was ready to order."
"If you get a chance to try the pig (cooked for hours at 64 degrees, boned and roasted with super crackling and baked apples) The wine was reasonable enough - they start at 15 euros.. and our menu included some wine and water too."
"If you fancy a change from the over priced hype of the sea front and really enjoy a challenging menu, don't miss out on this place."
I would recomment the set menu though - it can be very expensive otherwise.
The location of this restaurant is its crowning glory.
"food is also excellent but since the demise of the pound, i feel now that it is a ""special occasions only"" place for me."
Average bill is 100 euros per head.
"We are regular visitors to Nerja and were concerned to hear that El Candil, our favourite restaurant and first port of call when arriving in Spain, had changed hands."
On visiting again we discovered that the staf had bought the restaurant and it is just as good as ever.
Same excellent food and same happy and friendly service.
It was also nice to see that the previous owners are still regular visitors.
El Candil is situated in the best location in Nerja on the Balcon de Europa.
We love nothing more than to sit outside on the terrace watching the world go by with our friends enjoying good food and wine in a happy atmosphere.
Will be back again and again.
La Rita was an excellent dining experience.
The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.
"Four of us had a huge meal, including an appetizer, first dish, main course, desert, and drinks for a little over $100."
"And this is for gourmet food, everything was amazing."
"Also, we made no reservations."
We just walked in and were seated in minutes.
I can't think of anything negative to say about the place.
"If you are tired of traditional Spanish food, then visit this place for a true Catalan meal."
"If I ever visit Barcelona again, I would go back to La Rita in a heartbeat."
We had recommendations from locals to go there.
"It took us awhile to find it, we were totally lost!"
But once we found it was worth all the effort.
"Great food, especially the grilled meat dishes."
The wine selection is excellent for local Spanish wine.
"Look for the ""Ribera del Duero"" wine it's very good."
Coming from California Napa Valley we are very particular about the wine we drink and we enjoyed every minute of it in Spain!
The service was excellent very friendly and helpful in our selection of food.
"Don't miss on the ""goat cheese"" plate to share for 2 as a beginning course, all I can say is WOW!"
TYPICAL ENGLISH FOOD why come to Spain.
Certainly would not rate it in the top resaurants locally to torremolinos for food .
A great ENGLISH BAR !
!
"You can come there all day and stay all night - until they close : ) Mostly filled with english people since the owners are fra England, and there is entertainment every night even outside of season."
During the week it is mostly quiet but they have live music in the weekends.
"Lots of room for groups, but no room for dancing - it is an english pub."
"Never disappoints, we had various dishes there over three holidays, don't be afraid to try the'sombrero' pieces of beef/pork/chicken, you cook it yourself on a little sombrero shaped stove they bring to the table."
"Just one tip, if you like your steak medium ask for medium/well done, they tend to err on the side of undercooking, if you like cows the decor will blow your mind."
"Service is helpful and efficient, we have always had an inside table but outside has a great view, would the food get cold?"
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to enjoy a mix of catalan and japanese food.
"They have a fix menu and, as I understand, it is different each week."
The price is around 45 euros for one person.
"The food is excellent, if you like japanese."
"I ate there the best toro ever, but also some other dishes very interesting."
"In fact, I have never tried such combination of food, like strawberry soup with mascarpone and a lot more."
"It's better not to eat before coming there because the menu is enough, although it seems not so much in the beginning."
I would recommend you making a reservation before going there.
If I'll go back?
"Of course, I'm just waiting for that."
My husband and i have just come back from barcelona and we loved this hotel.Really great rooms done in tasteful decor and furniture (shower was amazing).
The rooms are small but we knew that before we went.Next time we would pay extra for a view of the outside world .
The staff were really helpful and pleasant.
The location was good for us as we were away from the Ramblas but only a 15 minute walk away.
If you like classy places this boutique hotel is perfect for you.
Breakfast was continental but very good .
"We had drinks in the bar one evening and really enjoyed the ambience ,its a great   people watching place ."
"I have been charged E3.50, E4.25 and E4.10 for a bloody of local beer [Dorada]."
"The guy just seems to charge what the hell he likes, and has the cheek to put it through the till."
"Almost to the last person we spoke with about this place, talked about being ripped-off."
"One guy we were in the complex with said he went on Sunday 19th April 2009 to some advertised event, and was charged E13.50 for three glasses of Dorada."
"Think about it, the Euro is almost on par with the pound."
"Would you pay £4.50 for a glass [not a pint], in a grotty establishment, the toilets stick of urine, no soap to wash your hands, the guy who takes the money a conman and thinks everyone who's not a local is just an object to be ripped off."
"Had a burger, fries, and even our child wouldn't eat more than a couple of fries as the burger was 'rammy'"
"A lovely place to spend your free time, champagne sangria and canary potatoes are a must."
"My friend had the seafood special, wow, his plate was full with a selection of different fresh fish."
The vegetable paella was beautiful.
The setting on the beach is also superb.
I visited this restaurant in March.
"Having read through the menu, I decided to opt for one of the evening specials."
This cost €10.50.
"This included a nice hot bread roll, glass of nice wine, and a massive plate of grilled mixed seafood, with Canarian potatoes, mojo dips and side salad."
It tasted absolutely gorgeous.
"As there was so much food, my only fear was that there had been a mistake and the waiter had mixed up my order, and I was going to be presented with a huge bill,but no."
"Altogether, with an additional glass of wine, the total bill amounted to a mere €13.10."
Oh and I also received a complimentary liqueur.
"The food was great, the location fantastic.. and the service was good too (I went down for the easter holiday) ... i ve seen that many complained about the service.. sure,.."
"I live in italy and the service here is much quicker ... but when you go to fuerteventura.. you just don t have to expect the service to be the same as back home..live there is very ""tranquilla"" - you have to take your time and enjoy the location.."
I had a fantastic time there...
The food is consistently good and the Sunday set lunch always outstanding.
The staff are utterly charming and it is always bustling with local families and groups.
We are regular visitors to Andratx and it is always a favourite.
If you like a proper steak then this is the place to go to.
Gaucho's is an argentinian steak house with standard portions ranging from €15-30.
Today was my second visit in one year and I was again very satisfied with the visit.
We rarely go back to the same restaurant twice on holiday but we went back to this one five times.
"The atmosphere was great, good service and friendly waiters who recognised us and welcomed us back as old friends."
The food is average price but very well cooked and presented.
"To top it off there is a singer in the square outside, who sings a good mix of songs, both English and Spanish."
"place is all right, food is good, but portions are extremely small and waiters can get really rude making the whole dining experience highly uncomfortable."
This place is always crowded.
"I got there around 10pm and only waited a couple minutes to get a table, but after that, you probably wait a lot longer."
It's the kind of place where I was OK with the fact that my wife and I shared a bigger table with 2 other people.
Clearly a local place on some back street in Madrid (know how to get there before you go).
The tapas are great and they're cheap.
They have menus in English but it's helpful to know at least a little Spanish.
"The staff are hustling, really busy, but I didn't find them at all rude."
"In fact, when I was going to order 1 meat item (and I'm clearly not from around there), the waitress suggested I try something else that was obviously better."
And she was right.
The sangria was tremendous...probably the best I've ever had.
"The atmosphere was fantastic, mostly locals."
"There's a TV in the corner, which means if soccer's on, especially Real Madrid, they're also watching that."
I was not at all disappointed.
"But this is a place you go to fill up on great, local food and sangria, not fine dining."
2 people can easily do 4 or 5 tapas and a pitcher of sangria for about 30-40 euros.
"March 26th 2009 : address is Calle Teide 6, Old Town Puerto del Carmen - Bodeco is worth a visit when in Puerto del carmen - run by Bo & Deco the experience is one that will remain with you - the selection on the menu is great - from Tradional irish dishes to Polish dishes - all worthy of a return visit - service was excellent and all staff are so friendly - well done Bo & Deco - Helen & Barry Co Meath Ireland"
Food selections varies from fried squids to freshly opened in half - sea urchins!!
"Their dishes are very special and delicious, though a bit pricey and despite having to wait for 20 minutes before dining ( theres a long line always once its opens) it is totally worth it."
"All high chairs, - their famous dish is the bikini and the foie burger ( foie gois burger/ sandwich ) ."
"They had rabbit with bones, lamb stew and much much more.!!!"
definately worth going back again!
waiters were friendly and gives good recommendations!
"When we read this review before we went to Los Cristianos, I made it my business to find out where this place was."
I cant believe its number 1.
Plastic garden furniture and plastic check tablecloths - food very good but not really a restaurant you would go to for a night out on holidays - more like a local cafe type place.
I find it really strange that its number 1.
Sorry I would not agree at all.
or quite possibly the world...but since I am Italian I will say it's the best in Barcelona.
"Try the bolognese, and the crema de verduras."
The jamoncitos de pollo (chicken with plums) is to die for too.
The salads are fantastic as well.
The staff is very friendly and the service is great.
I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant!
"This is a good value for money place in central town, and here you do not get stinky of frying as in other similar places."
"It has very good food and varied dishes, some mixture of Japanese, Chinese, and other eclectic things."
"Say very correct shushi, sashimi, and sea food, along items like a fried egg with green onion, a chinese bread, a duck in hoi shin sauce, a piece of beefsteak with fried onion, pieces of tofu..."
Please DO NOT DINE at this restaurant.
"""Barceloneta"" was recommended to us by a Spanish guy who we met in the plane on the way to Barcelona."
"It is way too expensive for what you get, the service is lousy, it is extremely noisy and loaded with [--]."
"There are many good restaurants at the harbor, so please do not waste your money at this TOURIST TRAP."
"I visited the monkey bar with my husband and 3 kids after a rep reccommended it to us, big mistake, on arrival it looked absolutely lovely, very clean and beautifully furnished."
"We ordered burgers and fries for the adults, which were totally mediocre, in all fairness I have had much better in mcdonalds, the childrens chicken nuggets were rock hard and also cold, and worst of all it cost about 70 odd euros!"
we did complain but just got a couple of grunts from the waiter!
so please avoid it and just go to mcdonalds instead!
"Our hotelier recommended this place, it was quite nice."
"Excellent seafood, catalunya style, exactly what we were looking for."
"It's a bit pricey, but we didn't think it was too expensive."
I read here good food but not the best.
"But what we ate there, no one should endure."
"The meat was only half cooked, a lot of big chunk potatoes and some vegetables who came right out of a metal can."
Really I don't wish this experience to nobody.
This is what I call a tourist trap.
"It looks nice on the outside and inside, but I don't go for the decor only to a restaurant, but mainly to have good food."
And what we had to pay for it was outrageous.
"No, for a good restaurant you have to be in Belgium apparantly."
[-------------------] --> oldest restaurant :-) --> old food yeah
Been coming to Bella Roma for years and it is consistently good.
The pizzas and pastas are all familiar and excellent.
There is also a wide choice of steaks and seafood.
Good choice of wine too at reasonable prices.
The staff have also been there for years (a good sign - they must be happy to be there) and are always friendly and efficient.
There is a take away service available too for both pizzas and pasta.
"Well worth a visit and much better than many of the ""Italians"" in the main town."
"Unbelievable, wonderful, excellent, best service and ambience!"
We will come again for sure!
"I have been here a few times over the past 20 years, and came here again tonight."
I must say that the vibe is still excellent and the food is as good if not better.
"We sat downstairs and had both pork and lamb, each dish wonderful, coupled with a ham & cheese starter, salad and a fine bottle of Rioja wine, it was a fantastic meal."
"Sitting in this history is always a plus, and it's just plain comfortable to be in."
Service was impeccable and the price was very fair- 90 Euros for 2 of us.
I will happily come back here in the future.
Researched this restaurant before going and it was well worth the research time and expense!
Started by sharing cured mountain ham and then for a main course we shared the seafood platter which although at times was slightly fiddly to break through shells etc was worth the wait!
The fish was very fresh and was a mixture of raw and lightly cooked - the cooked variety being season well and cooked so the original texture of the fish wasnt impaired.
Stunning food and the atmosphere is amazing - the restaurant is always buzzing and the waiters traditionally dressed and having to contort and move into all sorts of positions to get round the tightly packed in tables.
People eat at the bar too for a less formal meal - you have to try it!
"Rustic-chic decor, nice setting and great views."
"It opens relatively early as it's recommended by some travel guides, so you'll see a lot of foreigners (but some locals too) and booking is recommended."
Prices on the menu don't include 7% tax.
It's okay but in Andalusia you can eat as well or even better at cheaper prices.
"We paid 70 euros for 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 dessert, and half bottle of wine."
"Four of us went to this restaurant and me, being a mug, ordered Lobster (in garlic) at an advertised price per 200 gramms."
Cannot remember exactly what that was at the time but it looked ok.
The waiter brought out the lobster to show me and that was ok as well.
He did not estimate or even let on the price of the thing (not did I ask - I never have and I have eaten a few lobsters in the past).
"So muggins here, ate the lobster which was ok but not as good and flavoursome as one from the chinese for example."
We got the rest of the average med style seafood and that was also ok. Service was in spanish which we can get by in and no mention of any price of the dear (that is relevant) old (that is not as it was fresh) lobster who weighed in at 135 pounds (sterling).
Correct £135.00 for one lobster boiled and some garlic over it - nothing else...
I blame myself; stupid and at 53 years old should know better but there you go.
"If I had been even ""hinted at"" as to the price of the dish then I would have questioned further but I secretly think that they had a great laugh in the kitchen at the time; ""esta ingleses poco loco"" or something like that.. For that reason I would not go back but I think that more sensible people may not be too disapointed."
"I just do not like to be ""mugged""."
"A fellow reviewer suggested ""best restaurant in town"" but failed to say in what capacity - ""slight of hand"" is quite a good category for this restaurant."
Nostalgic...
What an unbelievable surprise that this sort of large chain-looking restaurant had such mouth-watering food!
"We were just walking up Las Ramblas, north of the Corte Ingles, where I'd gone to have a shoe fixed."
"My husband liked the look of Txapela (Cha-PELL-ah), so we stopped in for lunch."
I am looking at the 2 bills I brought home with all our choices.
We went back twice on a 3-day trip.
There was Not a Bad Choice!
They serve pinchos (small portions) of the most mouth-watering tapas we had in our entire trip!
"We went back the next night, and ate even more than the first time."
"I am a Huge Foodie, and boy, it was so yummy!"
"Also, it is so inexpensive!"
I still can't believe it.
The tapas in Barcelona are more sophisticated (I think) than the ones in Madrid.
Here they experiment more - it is like Spanish nouvelle cuisine.
Delectable and inventive.
"Having said that, here are the ones we tried, some will appear ho-hum by description, but believe me they were not: #1, the Tolosa - which was just a slider (tiny cheeseburger), but so delicious, with thick beef - we ordered this 5 times."
"#35, the Frances, is a tiny croissant with real crab spread."
"#45, something with goat cheese and a mushroom I think (I'm having trouble translating the souvenir paper menu, because it's in Catalan Spanish - different dialect); #16 Bikini, tiny sandwich with parmesan, asparagus - we had 5 of that also; #19 Mallorca, this had Brie, I remember thinking this was a bit too rich; #33 Donosti, a tuna mixture, good but prob my least favorite, they love tuna in Spain; #13 Patatas Bravas - spicy & delectable!"
"; #4 Xistorra, so yummy chorizo (Spanish sausage); #20 Txapela, with codfish - oh gosh, this is getting boring... .we also ordered #'s 11, 12, 32 (just to see what the Iberian ham tasted like)."
"On the 2nd nite, I just kept calling out numbers, because it seemed we couldn't pick a bad dish."
"Remember these are tiny appetizer size (pinchos), so you can get alot of different choices, which is so much fun."
"The first day we spent only 25 euros ($33 USD) for 2 hot teas, 3 glasses of red wine (tinto), and 11 pinchos!"
"We were very full, we just kept eating because it was so good!"
"To give you a comparison on how great a deal this is in Barcelona, the night before we ate at ANOTHER cafe (NOT this one) that had the nerve to charge 46 euros ($61) for 1 tea, 2 wine and 6 tapas."
The second nite we were real little piggies.
"But for the sake of accuracy I'll admit we had 16 tapas, 3 tintos, 2 tonic waters, and one hot tea for 37 euros ($49)."
One thing to watch out for.
We sat at the bar.
"Twice they came around with a plate & offered it to everyone sitting there, so it looked like they were offering free samples."
Well they're not - you have to pay for each one.
Damn.
"I was told that in the North of Spain you have to pay for everything, unlike the more relaxed South near Madrid & the seaside - where they give away free tapas if you just order a drink at the bar (yes it's true)."
This was a good example of that.
I asked them if this restaurant was a chain.
"Surprisingly, they said no, there is only 1 other like it in something that sounded like ""Franchia""?"
"Since they speak Catalan, I wasn't sure if this was a town in Spain, or somewhere in France."
But Txapela is owned by a professional restaurant group and it shows.
"Menu in the restaurant is in like 5 different languages, even Japanese, with photos, so any nationality can easily order."
Plus many tapas are displayed in a long case surrounding the bar.
"But there were mostly locals there, from the voices I heard."
"Superb food, right on a main drag, oh so cheap, most yummy tapas we ate in Spain."
This restaurant relflects very well Spanish cuisine.
"It has small ""pintxos"" that cost around 1.5euros each, it seems a lot but if you order 8-10 of those, it is filling and costs like a regualr main course."
Excellent combinations of foods and delicious desserts!
We ended up back here 3 times during our 2 week stay.
"Order the Almond Chicken, Pork in whiskey Sauce, Goat Cheese Salad (which isn't really a salad), eggplant in honey sauce and you will always come back for more!"
We have recently moved to Moraira from Brighton and stumbled across this gem of a restaurant one Sunday in March.
One look at the menu convinced us that it would be worth a try.
We were not disappointed.
My apricot-stuffed pork loin was delicious and the seasonal vegetables cooked to perfection.
"My partner's 'roast beef dinner' was an elegant interpretation of what is all too often a rehashed school-dinner, and the Yorkshire pudding looked so spectacular I had to pinch some of it when he wasn't looking."
The puddings were dreamy!
We tried it again a week later just in case the first occasion had been a lucky flash-in-the-pan.
Even better!
The location is superb but what really impressed us both was the quality of both the food and the service.
"On both occasions we went for the set-menu option rather than the a-la-carte, and it doesn't happen often that I was tempted by all the dishes on offer for each course."
A superb three-course meal with drinks for under 50 Euro...need I say more.
We are going back to Brighton in September and if I had my way I would try and drag Del Mar back with us.
"Brighton is justly famous for its restaurants so for those out there that know the place think 'Havana', but on the Costa Blanca."
Patrick and Leon
"Very good food, good quality and price, excellent service."
Only inconvenient is that they do not have a non smoking area.
Despite the fact that this a place for tourist(also because is located in a very touristic street) it's really good!
The tortillas are excellent and i really loved the fried brie!
The atmosphere is nice and confortable and the waiters are fast and really kind.
A nice place to try some spanish food and relax after a walk in passeig de Gracia!
(Fantastic sangria!)
"We went looking for a good restaurant along Avinguda del Paral·lel, and were mostly disappointed by a string of bars which served a bit of food on the side."
"Just off the avenue we found the lovely looking La Bodegueta del Poble Sec, which was a bit of an oasis among the bars."
"The decor was lovely, with casks lining the walls and nice furniture."
"The food style is primarily grilled, with meat and fish options."
I had the pork loin with pepper sauce and it was very good.
"My friend had a giant steak, but part of it was totally raw."
"Grilled options come with fried potato chunks they make fresh at the restaurant, but no other sides, so it is worth knowing that when ordering in case you want additional sides or starters."
We also had olives and bread with tomato rubbed on it: both were very good.
Smoking is permitted in the restaurant.
There are English menus available.
A group of us were in town and one of the group suggested that we meet here for dinner.
I was instantly suspicious as a felt a club can't possibly have good food.
I was sooooo wrong.
The sushi here is excellent and the rest of the menu is great.
"The service is outstanding, and if you are lucky enough to have dinner on a bed then you are in for a treat."
I'd highly recomend it.
Ended up going back again 2 months later and the food and the service were every bit as good.
I went there after some friends advice and did not like the food very much.
I think there are better values in Seville.
"Myself and my family have just arrived back from a week in Palma Nova, having found many of the restaurants to be expensive we decided to pop into a little restaurant called Natalies which is family run restaurant."
Immediatly we were given a very warm welcome from the restaurant owner Dave and his family.
The food was lovely (just like the dinners your mom makes) and inexpensive.
So we ended up eating here every day of our holiday.
"We would recommed the Sunday dinners and 'Daves' very own steak, the canjun chicken and probably everything else on the menu!!!!!"
Dave is one of the nicest people i have ever met and will he go out of his way to please you.
We love you Davexxx
Great fondues
The best review doesn't even do it justice.
Food is delicious!
"Steak is very tender and pizza, beautiful."
It's very busy and we had to wait about 45mins for a table but it was worth it.
Staff are lovely and add to the fantastic atmosphere!
Very reasonably priced too.
Fully recommend!
"Don't be put off by the word ""cafeteria"" on the sign, or anything else."
This is a really good place to eat.
Good value too as tax and side dishes are included - though that's not very clear on the menu.
"The choice and presentation of vegetables varies every day and are interesting, for instance stuffed pancakes stuffed."
Staff are helpful.
Try the veal neopolitana.
"Plenty to eat, we never had a dessert."
House wine is fine.
This restaurant is at the top of the hill in Frigiliana.
"Tables are outside, but shaded by umbrellas."
"The view is gorgeous, you can see a lot of the village from there."
"We ordered tapas, and the food was amazing, best tapas we had in Spain."
Be sure and order the corn fritters with sweet chili sauce.
"Highly recommended, a peaceful place to just enjoy being in Spain."
My husband and I had lunch at Arzak - booked by Villa Soro just down the hill.
We had never heard of it then (about 2 yrs ago) and had just been to El Bulli.
We were amazed at how delicious it was.
We had the degustation which was superb - every dish was a burst full of flavour.
The chef also came out and introduced herself which was a lovely touch.
I dream of going back.
Have to side with those posting here who found Arzak a real disappointment.
"We did all three, three-star restaurants in San Sebastian earlier this month."
"Akelarre and Martin B. were delightful, each in its own way."
"From beginning to end, we could not believe Arzak ever qualified for even one star."
"On entering, we were invited to seat ourselves in a small lounge/bar at the entrance."
"Over the next 15-20 minutes, several other parties joined us."
Each was asked if they wanted drinks.
"If so, they were served."
"Then we had the pleasure of sitting there, watching one gentleman play with his computer screen at the bar, apparently setting up something (seating?)"
for the night.
"Various people came in and out, talking and looking at the computer screen."
All ignored us.
Finally we were seated.
"Like many American posts I've read, we were denied non-smoking because it was ""full."""
"However, no one near us smoked and so it was not a problem."
"Although every plate looked like a work of art, as one would expect at a starred restaurant, the taste just wasn't there."
Dish after dish was a major disappointment.
"Meanwhile, staff would bring the wrong dish to the wrong person, seem confused, and have occasional debates/discussions over dishes that were coming out of the kitchen; these would be off to the side, but in full view of the diners."
"The chef, Juan Mari, was out of town, but his daughter, Elena, was the one bright spot, continually bouncing back and forth from the kitchen to the dining room."
She was very helpful in recommending choices and even substituted for one dish that I found completely unappetizing.
"Alas, it was to no avail."
"We enjoyed delicious meals of pintxos (hors d'ouevres, essentially) at a number of the excellent bars in San Sebastian for a fraction of the price we paid at Arzak."
All were superior to the meal we had here.
"I have had the tasting menu three separate times, once as a culinary tourist and twice while managing small groups."
"I make no claim to being sophisticated, but was delighted with the entire experience all three times."
"Twice, we were seated in the alcove off the kitchen, a very quiet and privileged area."
"Juan Mari Arzak is warm and gracious, in contrast to many top chefs."
"After all, it was his grandparents' home that has become the restaurant!"
"As one of the fathers of ""la nueva cocina vasca"", Arzak does not make chemistry projects out of food, but honors a long tradition of gastronomic excellence in one of my favorite cities in Spain."
The bar can be quite busy in the evenings but it's still worth a visit.
Try the local cider and have a fex apetizers from the bar.
If you stand as far along the bar as possible you will be first to try the specials which are delievered every 5-10 minutes.
"If you are hungry coming home from the beach, drop in for a few to keep the hunger in place."
We loved our lunch here.
Lots to choose from with fresh ingredients right from the market.
The atmosphere is modern and welcoming.
The service was great and there are plenty of options for all sorts of budgets and tastes.
"After reading many good reviews from various sources, I was extremely eager to try this place, and when I finally got the chance, it didn't disappoint, which is remarkable given my high expectations."
"The design and ambience are very attractive and the food was very good; in particular, the roast pork with tomato jam that I had was absolutely delicious."
The desserts were very nice too.
"Against it, I could say that the air con was a bit too strong and we felt a bit chilly, and that it's a bit more expensive than I'm used to, but nevertheless this is a very good place and I know I will be returning in the future"
We visited this restaurant with a group of 8 friends and were extremely disappointed with the tapas and service we received.
"Not only were the tapas average, they were vastly overpriced and the half rations were extremely small."
"When we complained, they were not at all apologetic and didn´t really seem to care."
To add insult to injury they added items to our bill that we didn´t have.
We will certainly not be recommending this place.
"With so many other good tapas bars in this area offering better value, the attitude of the staff seemed to be very short-sighted"
Visited this restaurant for my wifes 40th as part of our trip to Palma.
Great start as we had a window table on the 1st floor (red room) overlooking the street below (I emailed them a few weeks before and asked for a non-smoking table.
Lots of space and not too many tables overall so felt intimate.
Had the selection of of tapas for starters - the Tenderloin tips and five pepper oil  were to die for and would rate as one of the best bits of meat I have ever tasted.
FORN” potatoes with creamy brava sauce also excellent as were the Battered langoustines with parmesan cream.
For main we had 1 chicken dish and 1 steak dish.
Both were excellent althought as it was 3 weeks ago I can't remember exactly what For dessert my wife had the special which involved popping space dust - sounds a bit corny but it tasted fantastic.
All in all great food and service.
"Not cheap at 154Euros although that included wine, pre dinner drinks and liqueurs"
"We were originally in Palma to visit a bar called ABACO, which unfortunately was closed."
Opposite we found Forn de Sant Joan and we were drawn by the look of the place and the menu of the day.
No faulting that the place has a certain style and good ambience to it and one would imagine on a busy service the place would feel very buzzy.
The Saturday lunch time that we visited was very quiet.
"We chose the set lunch which for both of us was a bad choice..reading other reviews before posting this review, it is clear that we would have been better choosing from the wide selection of tapas that were available, however we still wouldn't have been able to choose different staff, with hopefully a better attitude than the ones that served us, who always seemed to have that ""end of shift "" rush about them."
"Perhaps we were there on the wrong day but the waiting staff were not the ones cooking the food, which on this occassion was poor."
I have been to this restaurant several times and I cannot be any happier I found it.
The atmosphere is superb and the dishes are amazing.
Well presented and elaborated the mixture of different flavours in your mouth make you love every dish you try.
Service is more than correct and the food is worth the money.
Very close to Gaudi's La Pedrera this place is one of the best choices when visiting Barcelona.
"My guide-book recommended this place, so being in the area and wanting to try a ‘Basque’ restaurant for the first time, we decided to give it a try."
"On seating, our waitress told us that there was no menu, as they had served the same food for 30 years."
"She then proceed to tell us the menu, which consisted of just 4 mains (2 meat, steak but different cuts, and 2 types of white fish)."
"We debated whether to leave, but as it was late, and we were very hungry, we decided on the T-Bone steak."
We were also told that the side dish was slow-cooked red peppers.
"I asked if they did potatoes (I’m Irish), but no, so we went with her suggestion of red peppers."
The T-Bone steak was large but very tough.
"After several minutes of vigorous sawing and chewing, we complained and they agreed to replace it with something else on the menu."
That will be the fish then!!.
"This was fine, but you can’t really go wrong with plain white fish."
"On receiving the bill, it suddenly dawned on us that because there was no menu, we didn’t see any prices."
The side-dish of red-peppers came to a whopping 22euro.
"My starter of soup came to 15euro, as did my partners 3 white asparagus tips!!."
"We complained, about the cost, and they agreed to take the peppers off the bill."
"I go to upmarket/ Michelin-star restaurants every now and again, and don’t mind forking out for a fine meal, but these prices left us feeling ripped off."
There was no imagination or flare to the food at all.
"When I go to a restaurant, I expect to get something I couldn’t cook up too easily at home."
With a menu of just plain grilled Steak and Fish (no sauce) I wonder how any chief with an ounce of ambition can stay working here for more than a week.
A 10 year old could cook this.
"Most of the clientele seemed to be English-speaking/tourists (as were we), so that, and the fact that there was no menu, left us feeling that we had just dined at a tourist trap."
"To be fair to them, when we did complain, they didn’t hesitate to replace our steaks and not charge for the red-peppers."
They also didn’t charge us for our apéritif.
"However, a bill of almost 140euro for 2 whiskeys, 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 desert and a mid-range/25euro bottle of wine, is steep for such standard fare."
We are local people who visited this rural house with local friends recently so we could consider it for visitors.
"When we arrived, we were greeted outside and could not enter the hotel and were told we had to have our beverages outside."
This was the first shock and we were going to just leave but we did not.
The gentleman who waited on us seemed to be put out that we were there.
A woman at the front entrance glared at us as if we were not welcome.
"Although the beverages were fine, the gentlemen who waited on us was very unfriendly."
"I personally took a walk around the facility and was asked by a the same gentleman if I needed something and told him no, that I was just looking but he was not happy."
I then asked him if he spoke English as the web site appears to be in English and the vehicle outside of the hotel that advertises the hotel is in English and he told me he did not speak English and then he walked away.
"As locals with many visitors from various countries, we expected a friendly rustic inviting atmosphere and only received a bad taste in our mouths."
We all concluded that we would never return to the facility or have any of our friends or relatives stay there while visiting.
Such a shame the people who run or own the hotel do not match the surrounding.
"I cannot speak about the service as a paying overnight guest, but I saw enough to know that I would not spend a fabulous weekend amongst people who were so rude."
"Very good and creative food, especially the ""free"" appetizers and bread."
Main courses were o.k.
although mine was cold so I had to return it for additional cooking.
"The pre-desert was excellent…better than the dessert itself, but maybe we were just too full."
"Restaurant was completely empty, so it ruined a bit the experience."
"Adding to that the light food poisoning my wife got and the 100 Euros check (inc’ ½ bottle wine), I will not recommend it to a friend."
Went to the Casa Pedro on the strength of a recommendation from the Rough Guide (Directions) Guide Book.
Party of four.
"We sat down and immediately ""given"" a bread roll and butter without being asked."
"We were given the food menu, but told that they didn't have a drinks menu."
"Ordered typical local dishes (""Filet"" steak in roquefort sauce, fish (""grouper"") and king prawns in sauce) and beer, half carafe of wine, half carafe of sagria."
The food with the exception of the prawns was of short measure and not particularly good.
No way was my steak a filet and the roquefort sauce had no taste of cheese that I could detect...
"The big surprise, however, was the bill."
"Our bread rolls cost Euro 1.00 pp, the 3/8 litre of wine and sangria Euro 8.00 each and the beer Euro 3 (very small glass)."
The bill for four meals and the drinks was Euro 75.
"We did not give a tip"""
"The ""rich man's paella"" so named because all the seafood is shelled for you."
What a joke!
Almost no seafood and what was there tasted like it came from the Yangtze River.
The rice was soaked in a salty and oily brown goo.
This is an expensive tourist trap.
How do they get away with this???
Shame on them and the guidebooks who recommend them.
"been eating here for years never been disappointed,well worth a visit"
Absolutely wonderful environment to have a great meal.
"The décor is exuberant, the food is great (try the chicken pastela it's perfect if you love a little protein with your sugar), and the staff seems to be down to earth and genuine."
Overall happy experience.
Try the mint lemonade.
Try the mint tea.
Go with a group and order one of everything.
We had dinner at this wonderful restaurant.
Check out their website for pictures showing the decor-it was beautiful.
"The owner was very friendly, the server attentive, and the food was delicious."
"We ordered two appetizers (the sampler for 2 was one of them and was a huge plate, along with a basket of bread) and one entree-the chicken couscous with raisins and onions- for two of us to share, and were stuffed-no room for dessert."
"We did try the mint lemonade, which I didn't care for, but my daughter loved."
"It came to $47, and well worth the experience."
I live 200 M from this restaurant.
"The food is ok, even ""good"" but it's not great Russian food, its also not cheap."
"If you want Russian and are in the area its fine, atmosphere is pleasant, service is good, menu interesting, but nothing worth going out of your way for."
I also lived in Moscow for 3 years so I am familiar with Russian cuisine.
"Food: Fresh, elegantly presented, some surprises without overabused tricks Wine: Excellent."
Worth asking recommendations of sommelier and try some less known Spanish wines as well.
Place: Seaview almost from every table.
Service: Extremely professional still relaxing.
Chef himself came to chat with us twice.
Only minus on smoking.
Someone was smoking cigar and we could feel it even at our table.
"My girlfriend and I were on our way to plaza santa anna and she spotted this resturant...the interior is a mix of reds, whites and blacks in a minimalist /fusion motive....there was a good crowd... it was a tuesday evening at about 10...the prices were quite reasonable and there was a nice variety ....fine dining at budget prices...i had the pork roast cooked in the traditional fashion...it was excellent...the salads were huge and they featured a nice rebiero del duro red for under 10 euros...we just arrived from a week in paris and this resturant compares quite well with what we experianced there... we saw a huge plate of muscles they looked great but we didn't try them...there was also a nice selection of fish on the menu....we're going back to try lunch"
I am quite surprised to read mostly good food reviews about this place.
"I can understand that people can be taken by the setting, Ginger restaurant's retro decor and lively atmosphere make it an enviable place to be."
And that is what took us there as well as the menu which outlines fine food at unbeatable price.
We were there Sunday 26 April 2009 and up for a fine dining and romantic setting in the middle of Madrid's old popular quarter.
"Suspicion set in with the staff, dealing with us more like cattle and our fears were proven true as the food arrived, a mix of stuff put together with no clue about taste nor flavour."
"My main course was pompously named ""cod confit with aubergine mousse and crispy leek""."
"For those who are not familiar, a confit is slowly cooked submerged in its own rendered fat, in which it is then preserved by allowing it to cool and storing it in the fat, which is supposed to let natural flavours unravel."
"What came was more like a frozen piece of cod, with slimy consistence on top of an aubergine soup with yellow leek and needless to say, no taste."
"We mentioned to the manager the over-pompous menu that led dinners to great expectations, and she put the problem on the translation and when she brought us the Spanish, English and French versions even no language connoisseur could tell no difference."
"Go there to show-off, not for the food, even the atmosphere dries off pretty quickly."
A great family run restaurant providing the best of spanish food.
The fish is always the very best.
"However, the steak with pepper sauce is heavenly."
i have benn to this restaurant 14 times and every time i go its still as good as i can remember.
it is a must see if you go to majorca
Potser el millor peix que he menjat a Barna.
"it is one of the oldest taverns in Barceloneta, which might explain why the bill is quite high."
The food (fish paella) wasn't bad however (though I had no idea what was in it .. strangest paella I ever ate)
"when an undress plate of four lettuces and some onion arrives as your E10.50 'ensalada en crutites' arrives know you are not going to have a great evening... turbot was E21 and terrible, rape at the same price better value (at least it was E8 worth of fish( but dressed with recooked rubbery clams and muscles, no veg, no potatoes, just awful."
"they used to do good tapas, no longer."
"Kitchen is full of disinterested chinese cooks from what I could see, but maybe I shouldn't have seen that."
It's probably still in the guide books... it shouldn'd be
Gastronomic Fixed Menu for lunch (42 Euros) Overall El Duque is a great experience - worth doing if you are here only one day.
"On the Menú gastronómico what percentage you pay for food and what % for ""the experience"" is open to debate."
I would suggest that a entrada (morcilla) and Cochinillo (suckling pig) is better value for money; or even a salad to start with to be slightly lighter.
Share a decent bottle of wine between you (could get 4 people per bottle) rather than the vino joven to get a better quality wine (if you're into wine) and finish with coffee and tarta ponche sergovina (together).
Would be less expensive and hit all the highlights.
The details follow: Wine - Vino joven de la región (Abadía Real 2007) - 750ml bottle!
"OK, light tempranillo - offers little on the nose; red fruit (just); slightly dry; medium finish."
Entrada - various especialties of the Segovía.
"See photo (clockwise from top right; 2pm): quesos de la región, morcilla a la segoviana, chorizo a la olla, Judiones a la granja, picadillo de la matanza, salchichas al vino blanco."
In the middle sopa Castellana.
"Of these the Morcilla (blood sausage) has a delicate snokey/spicy flavour; the cheese is creamy with delicate flavours; the Chorizo looked like it was cooked yesterday but tastes good (a little dry); the Judiones are large beans in a mild tomatoe sauce served lukewarm; the picadillo has all the flavour of chorizo without being dry; the salchichas are softer & milder versions of chorizo - delicate, but somewhat lukewarm."
La sopa castellana appears to have fat swimming in soup (later found it was yesterday's bread that had soaked up the fat) with mild chilli falvouring.
Pick of the lot: Morcilla or Picadillo.
2do Plato - Cochinillo asado en horno de leña (marca de calidad).
Served all on it's own - no accompaniment.
How old was this piglet?
Leg length (from joint to trotter) 20cm +/- (8 inches for you Yanks).
Meat is delicate.
Have you ever seen a piglet - they're lean - little fat.
Perhaps the secret.
Perfectly cooked (2 hours on one side and 1 1/2 on the other - the waiter informed me).
Lovely crackling on the outside.
Meat falls off the bone - you can cut it with a fork.
"Lovely flavour - not at all ""Porky"" - moist with very little fat."
Worth NZ$50 (std price?)
"- not sure, but fantastic nonetheless."
"Dessert: Tarta Ponche Segoviano Covered with thin Marzipan, which has been seared by a hot iron rod (crscrossed to form a diamond pattern)."
Inside it has a custard filling between orange flavoured sponges.
Sweet whilst still being delicate.
It deserves a coffee to be served with it to counteract the sweetness (which initially picks up a headache from the mix of this and the over consumption of Vino Joven!).
Delicious but perhaps more suited to an afternoon tea/coffee than a dessert.
Cafe y Aguardiente de la casa (licor de hierba - to help with digestion supposedly).
Coffee is good (filterquality) without being superb.
"Aguardiente (herb infused liquor) is full on, yet strangely moorish."
It's pretty much a fast food version of all the baguette or sandwich shops you see all over the place.
"Best to go to one of the smaller, family-style cafes that sell baguettes or small sandwiches if you want a quick lunch."
"I went there to buy a baguette to take back to the apartment and it was like going to Subway for a load of bread, why would you do that?"
"The guy behind the counter was very nice though, and the baguette cost one euro."
"It was our first night in Barcelona, staying in El Born district, and we wanted a nice restaurant."
"The waitstaff was very nice and professional, offered menus in both Spanish and English."
There seemed to be mostly locals dining here on a Sunday night which is what we prefer.
"I ordered the Risotto which was excellent, the salad was perfect as well - warm goat cheese baked on an apple slice."
"The restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere, dinner ended with a really good Tiramisu and an offer of free Limoncello shots."
I had a lovely evening here.
The surroundings are nice and the service friendly.
"The food wasn't great, we had the house special roast lamb which I found dry and overpriced, our starter wasn't great either."
Nice wine though.
"Listed in Frommers, Spain."
"Instead of a warm greeting, my wife and I were met by a Maitre D', very full of himself, who looked annoyed, muttered something and gestured that we should wait out of the way, over by the door."
"After a few minutes, we were escorted upstairs and seated."
"Overall, a nice looking place."
"Their specialty , grilled meats."
"The appetizers were forgettable and small, but expensive, i.e., $23 euro for about 8 tiny shirmp in olive oil."
"For mains, I ordered the veal chop, my wife had rice with rabbit."
"For a place specializing in grilled meats, I was shocked with the quality and size of the veal chop; thin, very chewy with not a trace of flavor."
"The rice with rabbit is appropriately named, mostly rice with two, count 'em, two pieces of rabbit bone with a few strings of meat (was it really rabbit-?)."
The red wine was good and the basket of bread (4 slices) was 1.50 euro.
"After the waiter took our order, he was off, bowing and scraping with much fanfare to the Spanish speaking patrons, leaving our table service and check transaction to the underling bus staff."
"I made several attempts to catch his eye, to no avail."
He didn't even come back to see if we wanted coffee and dessert (we didn't).
"The total bill was 113 euro, we left no tip."
"This was the most expensive meal we had in Madrid and without a doubt the worst overall dining experience we had in our 8 days in Spain, (possibly in all my years of travelling)."
"Needless to say, it was a rip-off."
They knew we would probably never return and treated us accordingly!
"Hopefully, this reveiw will save other travelers a similar fate."
"Very good family run restaurant serving German food, we were greeted like long lost friends and the service is excellent."
"The food is typical German, big pork steaks, chicken and beef."
They also do very good pasta dishes.
"Very good value for money, you come out feeling well fed."
I would have not hesitation in coming back again and again.
Book tables in high season Maureen Seitz
What a find!
"Quite difficult to find actually, its up the main street in Calpe and turn left to the Courthouse, then turn left to the side of the Courthouse."
"British run, its a pretty, small restaurant with a fountain in the hallway."
Good atmosphere although customers seem to be mainly Brits.
The couple who run the restaurant are really nice and helpful.
They don't overcrowd the place so you don't have to wait long and you are not rushed to leave.
They do a three course meal with half a bottle of wine for 19.5 Euros and it is really nice i.e.
"lat time I hade the chicken livers to start, crispy duck for main, creme brulee for pud."
Really nice.
I would advise you book especially on a Saturday and definitely in the busier season.
We found this great little place in the Chueca ditsrict entirely by chance - having walked out of a recommended restaurant nearby when the staff ignored our arrival.
"It looks like a very basic tapas bar and restaurant, and definitely has no frills - but the food on the short menu was of the highest quality, and very reasonably priced - and the young man who served us was very keen to see that we enjoyed our meal."
"The address is C/ Pelayo, 8."
[--]
Four of us went to the Tipico Canario Restaurant based on a review in the Rough Guide Directions Guide.
The restaurant is at the eastern end of the (old) Playa Blanca seafront.
You will be invited (hustled?)
to come in by the black shirted waiters - who are very friendly and engaging.
"We were looking for typical, local food - two of us chose lamb dishes and the other two were persuaded to share the double fish platter (for Euro 29)."
"The food was frankly disappointing: the lamb chops were somewhat tiny, my lamb stew consisted of several lamb ribs in a thick gravy (I guess that I was expecting the hispanic equivalent of a Lancashire Hotpot!)"
- and the double fish platter consisted of a modest portion of somewhat dry fish - not very tasty.
The vegetables consisted of a handful of papas arrugadas each.
We had wine and beer with the meal and ended with coffee and leche-leche (very milky coffee made with condensed milk - delicious if you like that sort of thing!)
The bill was Euros 73 for the four of us.
"On the positive side, the restaurant is in a great location with views towards Fuerteventura."
It is very popular and lively.
I guess that you don't go there for the gastronomy!
Would I recommend it to a friend?
It depends what turns them on.
Loads of atmosphere?
then yes - but if they are looking for really good food then no
"Just outside the walls of the Juderia, Meson Juan Pena is the best spot I've found to taste wonderful local cuisine."
"My friend sent me there to try the fried eggplant, which is fantastic."
"We also enjoyed the little pots of spinach and chickpeas and cardoons in a special sauce; the tuna was also fabulous, and the night we were there they were serving a special salad of oranges, tomatoes and cured ham laced with a fruity, strong olive oil."
"The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't all that expensive, either."
"Be sure to try the house sherries, both the dry and the sweet."
"We stumbled a bit by accident into one of the several La Mordida restaurants in Madrid, just looking for something not overly fanciful to eat."
All in all we were pleased with this random choice.
The food was tasty and a clear step up from some other 'Mexican' chain restaurants.
"The decoration was fun, somewhere between art and true kitsch."
"The main downside was that while the restaurant is big enough to have a mandatory split between smoking and non-smoking zone, they had only opened the former on this weekend evening."
"At first this was no problem, but later people came in who started to fill the atmosphere with fumes."
"Service is good and nice but the food not good, i don't recomend."
"Three of us ate at this restaurant located in the old town of Barcelona, very close to the harbor."
"We ordered three things and split them: lasagne, calzone, and a pizza."
"The pizza and calzone were really delicious, but the lasagne was not nearly as good."
"I would say the lasagne was average, while the pizza was excellent."
"The prices were reasonable for the location, neither expensive nor cheap."
"There is a bar/tapas side to Boga, as well as the main restaurant area."
"We just ate in the main restaurant areas, which is pretty basic in decoration and furniture."
This is a great bar serving a wide range of interesting hot and cold tapas and bar meals.
The staff are friendly and efficient and most of the customers are locals which give it a good atmosphere.
The prices are good too.
I live in the next street and use the place regularly.
Indian and Ecuadorian... go figure.
I give it a 4 on value alone.
"I had lomo saltado (w/ rice, beans, and salad) and garlic naan and they were delcious and ridiculously cheap for Barcelona."
9 Euros with a drink.
I do wish they had smaller plates so that I could have mixed and matched more.
"It was the best value meal I had in BCN, considering price, taste, and quantity."
"There was nothing super-fantastic about the joint, but it was worth it after the many more expensive, but sub-standard meals I had around town."
Remarkable catalan-inspired michelin experience.
"Flawless service, though with prices to match."
Reliable eatery which caters for the summer beach crowd coming in for the big meal of the day !
A visit to Moreno is a must if you are in Burriana or Nerja.
Their fish cooked fresh on wood fires is dreamy.
"While along with many other restaurants along Playa Burriana they offer plates of paella from their regular cooking, so much better are the Paella Extra they will cook for two or more."
This 'personal' paella provides a really lovely meal to share in a lovely atmosphere right on the beach
A local recommended this as the best of the beachside restaurants.
"I can't comment on thast as I didn't try the others, but it was a darn good beachside place."
"Delicious squeaky fresh sardines, reasonably priced."
"My wife and I recently spent several days in Madrid and tried Bazaar the first night in town, based on positive online recommendations."
"The menu is a very unique mixture of small tapas style dishes, but not typical Spanish fare."
The menu is a bit confusing at first as it is a continuous listing and does not separate starters from mains or desserts.
"We tried several starters, which were all very good, i.e."
excellent goat cheese salad.
"For mains we had a variety, from fish, chicken and meats."
"The ""3 grilled meats with noodles"" was just okay, the rest were terrific."
"Finished with two desserts, try the ""Madagascar Dessert"" if you like vanilla cream and chocolate, it will knock your socks off."
We returned to Bazaar on our last night in Madrid and our meal selections were better than the first night.
"The Spaghetti with mushrooms, cod dishes etc."
were excellent.
Wine is plentiful and cheap.
"As a matter of fact, both meals cost around 65 euro each night, that's for two."
You can eat for much less if you want.
"The atmosphere is clean, white wood with glass and lots of bric-a-brac of canned and packaged food products lining shelves."
The service is where Bazaar needs improvement.
Although we were seated very quickly on both occations (no reservations) the wait staff is lacking in personality and seem to avoid eye contact with patrons.
"On our first night, we had a young waitress who spoke excellent english which was a big help."
"On our second evening, we were not so fortunate and had a tough time understanding how several unique sounding dishes were prepared."
"Luckily, we made good choices, as all dishes were terrific."
"Additionally, the waiters do not smile and while they are not rude, they just put the food down and pick up the plates when finished."
No conversation at all.
They also know how to make themselves scarce and seem to dash into the safety of the kitchen every chance they get.
"Overall, a ""very good"" relaxed dining experience."
Excellent and interesting food at a great price.
Just don't expect a jovial wait staff.
"Bodega Santa Cruz is fantastic on all counts-- brilliant atmosphere - it was always busy, any time of day I was there and never dull."
full of tourists but also loads of locals - always a good recommendation IMHO food is fantastic and also best value for money of any I had in Seville same goes for the drinks and the breakfast (this in particular was fantastic) I spent a lot of time here on my recent visit and it was worth it in every way - hard to top
"Having been to this restaurant 3 times, it has never failed to amaze me how the attention to detail is only matched by the stuning views down the Jalon valley."
Many corses usually fixed price even the wine is included.
"This place is an okay option for local cuisine, and it's inside the Juderia."
The salmorejo is good; the eggplant and the flaminquin only average.
"If you are going to shell out for a nice meal, I'd suggest another place; if you are hungry and are in the Juderia, try eating in the downstairs taberna instead of upstairs in the dining room."
That evens out the cost-quality ratio.
This restaurant serves great italian food.
"Located in the best night life area of Barcelona, El Born, is attended by nice clients and surrounded by great bars and coffee shops."
"The service is excellent (you will probably end up talking to owner Giovanni), the food really good (real italian), and the price is best possible, affordable to everybody."
"Okay, the food was good to very good (depending on which plate)."
"The service very good considering it was sunny, a Sunday and everyone seemed to be jostling for a table."
"The atmosphere though--while we ordered, the two-year old could play on the beach (and pick up 8 lovely young women who thought Ethan with his curly hair, ""SOOOO cute."")"
"A delightful place to veg...eat, and people watch."
Just grab a table when it is your turn and don't look back.
"Our bill was 191,74 Euros ($258.00)."
Our waiter (from South America) held up a plate of seafood when we sat down and claimed I ordered it as an appetizer.
The cost was 109euros ($146.00).
"When we realized what had happened (less than 5 minutes), they said it was too late."
They take advatage of tourists.
Avoid this place.
"We wanted a truly authentic paella and so followed the advice of a reliable ""insider"" guide."
The restaurant is traditional elegant - next to the Opera in a historic building.
"Their menu features about a dozen variations of paella - the famous one-pan rice and seafood, vegetables and seasoning dish."
All paella are served for two so plan on collaborating with your fellow diner(s).
"We ordered the ""Paella Mixta"" which came with 2 shrimp, mussels, crab and crawfish."
"It was fresh and interesting, but in the end disappointing."
The portion was modest; the actual qualtity of seafood by weight seemed pretty limited for 30.60 Euros.
"The flavor was good, but quite mild cpmpared to what we expected."
"The other customers all seemed to be local adulta and families, so it may have other choices that are more of a hit."
"Blech, The Paella Real is definitely not that."
Neither royal nor real.
My grandfather is from Spain & I was very disappointed.
"I couldn't even taste the saffron, which you use to flavor the rice."
Even my WASP fiance commented on his own that it was bland - and that was before I even said anything about it!
We had been laughing it up so much beforehand that it took me a few bites to realize my disappointment.
"I told both the manager & our waiter how disappointed I was in the taste - no chorizo, tasteless rice, but they really couldn't care less."
"They listened, kept defending their miserable cooking, saying all paellas are different, and didn't offer any compensation - not a price reduction, glass of wine, an olive - nothing."
This place disgusts me just thinking about it.
I was so hepped up to get a paella in Spain - haven't been back since I was 14 - and it was so fall-hard-on-your-butt disappointing.
I now realize that paellas are somewhat of a racket in Spain - lots of expensive offerings everywhere.
"Probably better to get as tapas, so it's not so expensive & you aren't expecting so much."
"The room is pretty, but who cares."
Paella Real - phooey!
Could be one of PDI most overrated restaurants.
Cold atmosphere and way to expensive.
If you want to eat really good and can afford to pay for it go to Bamira in playa del Aguila instead.
Well worth the trip.
"If you are a chocolate lover like I am, then this place is well worth a visit!"
Yummy melt in the mouth to die for chocolate... amazing... if you're not sure get the little chocolate fishes and try them 1st.
This place is great
My husband and I went to this restaurant in early April.
"All items on the menus he and I ordered were completely tasteless, but the prize for Worst Food Experience 2009 must surely go to my onion soup."
"This was a whitish (yes, whitish!)"
"liquid that neither looked nor tasted like anything resembling onion soup (if the truth be told, it didn't taste of anything at all); it gave the impression of having been made by dissolving a tablespoonful of white flour into a litre of tepid water, and the only trace of onion I could find was a thin, anaemic-looking slice completely devoid of flavour."
"My second and the dessert were not much better, and my husband's choices turned out to be very unsatisfactory, too."
"As for service: the woman owner, who was not terribly friendly, spent a vast amount of time giving out to an unfortunate young waitress who was clearly at the end of her tether and whose mistakes I felt could be easily excused by the pressure she was under."
"I couldn't help thinking that management would have been better employed making sure the food coming out of the kitchen was of acceptable quality, than breathing on this poor girl's neck."
"The restaurant is located in a very nice area and looks very inviting from the outside, but that's the only positive thing that can be said about it."
My advice to other travellers is: AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE.
"After a long stroll through upscale Salamanca and Park Retiro, we were in much need of a break at afforadable prices."
There is not much other than upscale cafes or Starbucks right near the Prado / Reina.
"Our Fodor's recommended La Dolores, and it met our needs perfectly."
"2 euro wines and delicious plate of olives in a lively bar with fast, efficient, and friendly service."
A couple of colleagues and I were taken here for a business lunch.
The place is out of town and outwardly unassuming.
"However the atmosphere inside, the food and the service were, in my view, excellent."
"Great selection of local and traditional Spanish dishes, good selection of quality wines, really first class service."
"I didn't pick up the tab, it would certainly not have been cheap but nor would I imagine it was exorbitant."
"If you are around that area, I can definitely recommend it."
"Brisa del Mar is first and foremost a fish restaurant, owned and run by a family of Motril fishermen."
"Whilst we did not eat there we did, on the recommendation of a local, visit the bar to sample the tapas."
Two minutes after ordering a beer and a tinto de verano for wife and myself a huge plate of assorted pieces of fried fish appeared in front of us.
"Cod, prawns, squid, octopus and hake we could not believe it."
After a while I ordered another beer and was given a soup plate size bowl of mussels in a delicious tomato based sauce..
The bar is quite small and seating is limited so we were pleased when the barman pointed out 2 stools that were vacant.
When we moved to them my wife fell into conversation with a group of expats and about 20 minutes later wanted another vino.
"Shortly after I ordered the drinks the barman appeared with yet another plate of squid in a batter, complete with half a fresh lemon."
Having eaten earlier we were feeling the strain about now and when we ordered our last 2 drinks we asked him not to bring us any tapas.
"He seemed surprised and asked us if we had not enjoyed our tapas, we pointed out that they had been excellent but we were sated."
So if you like fish and you love tapas then Brisa is for you.
Beware do not have a meal before you go!
!
A lovely little cafe on the front in this newly developed port.
"Only had a sandwich, but it was very tasty and reasonably priced."
Would recommend.
if you are near just try their chicken in pepper sauce and lovely canarian potatoes.
had two meals here in a week even though we were all inc. lovely house red wine.fab service with the personal touch.loved it.
not expensive either.go there.
Brilliant.
"What an experience, So refeshing and cush a change from the normal restaurants."
I visited in june 08 and again in aug/sept 08 each time we went it was full with locals celebrating.
Its so good to see family eating places at there best.
Food is so varing everyone will find something to tickle their tasebuds and the waiters/waitresses are ever so friendly and helpful.
No problems recommending this restaurant
April 2009 - just back from a week in Los Cristianos.
Great place.
"Went to Chill Out twice - I had the fillet steak (no sauce) twice, it was really good."
My husband had the special which was baked fish in sea salt - really gorgeous.
Great house red wine - only 2.95 for a generous glass.
"Bit pricier than some places, but well worth a visit."
Location is just through the tunnel towards the big beach on the right hand side.
I would cross a country on the back of a donkey to go back to this restaurant.
It is that good.
Words can not describe how good it actually is so i am not going bother to try.
"Make sure you order as much variety as you can, the food is charged by weight so ask for smaller portions of a lot of dishes."
"There is only 1 English speaking person which just happens to be the sous chef, Lennox."
He guided us through one of the most memorable meals of my lifetime - top 3 for sure!!!!
"I live on the opposite side of the world and i WILL go back to Spain, just to go to that restaurant!"
So do yourself a favor and plan to go there rather than to the over rated Michelin restaurants in San Sebastian.
Trust me!
Have eaten twice and agree with the rest exspensive and small portions.
Ambience is nice depending on where you sit but service can be a liitle slow.
Haven't been back since last visit as one of the group had beef stroganoff which she couldn't eat much off as it tasted salty and didn't really taste of any thing else.
On the way home she said she felt sick and actually vomited about 5 minutes later so that has put her off a little bit but no further problems following that one episode.
All in all still a nice restaurant and we will probably return in October when we return.
The view of the Alhambra is great but what makes Ruta del Azafran fabulous is the food.
Often location trumps quality but not in this case.
The space is minimalist chic yet cozy and bright.
The papas rotas (broken potatoes) are amazing.
I wasn't able to taste everything but the chef is to be trusted.
Staff I enjoyed but some find them off putting because they don't fuss over you which can be good if you like to take your time.
I didn't want to leave.
We ate breakfast in here over our weekend in Barcelona.
It was a delicious experience.
"There is a huge choice of sweet and savoury baguettes and croissants filled with hams, salamis, cheeses and even nutella!."
All are beautifully presented and the counters are extremely clean and well lit.
The coffees are hot and memorable but the freshly squeezed orange juice and fruit skewers are outstanding.
The place has a great atmosphere with Spanish businessmen and ladies who shop popping in for a quick snack and coffee before they hit those high powered meetings or drive down the price of that pair of Jimmy Choos they have their eye on!
The lady behind the counter doesn't smile much and our waiter reminded us of a Spanish Jack Dee.
He seemed to be sneering at our humble attempt to speak Spanish but he did warm up later and we even saw him smile before we left!
"We had a nice dinner at Veronica's on a friday night - like the locals we sat down at 10.30 PM - but I think that maybe the staff was on their way home, because they forgot half our orders."
"I order a salad as my starter - which I never got, and I ordered coffea for my dessert, but never got it (but my date got her tea) All in all its good solid food - and the resaurant is really nicely and quirky decorated - don't expect the best meal you've ever had, but do expect a good night out with some healthy food."
I would probably visit Veronica again if I got the chance.... and this time I'd make sure I got what I ordered....
We just spent two weeks in Estepona and ate at La Pappardella three times.
The pizza is great - Naples style - thin crust.
The pastas were all delicious - the sauces were excellent - especially the creamy tomato sauce.
Loved the avocado salad!
Definitely try the gnocchi with the meat ragu!!!!
The service is excellent and friendly - they greet you like an old friend.
"the atmosphere was great, the drinks were great, the stuff was great...."
I strongly recommand it to everybody!!!
!
We had a wonderful meal here last week.
"We ordered the 7 course tasting menu, which was fabulous in all respects."
Our hotel recommended this tapas bar to us after just arriving late and hungry just around the corner from the Hotel Casa Fuster where we stayed.
This place is amazing.
My husband and I were so excited at the prospect of eating wonderful Spanish food when we arrived in Barcelona and this place is what it is all about.
"It s fresh, its tasty and its moderately healthy and you will not find food like it anywhere in the UK."
I strongly recommend all to visit this place for lunch or dinner you will not leave disappointed.
To avoid lond waits for inside tables hang around the waiter outside.
They are remarkably fast and will find you a table as soon as they can.
But at the end of the day I will say its just luck an incredibly busy place but well worth it.
"The asparagus, baby calamari, green peppers and ofcourse the hams and cheeses are wonderful."
Infact its all wonderfeul we shall miss this place.
Enjoy.
Go there early (before 8pm) otherwise you'll have to wait a long time.
Really good food and you can choose a large choice of good quality Tapas.
Sangria with Cava is really good too.
"Wanted to have ""Pulpo Galiega"" but it was over at 7.30 pm for a Special of the Day !"
Shame for us.
Good service.
Waited about an hour for a table...this place is always hopping and they don't take reservations.
"To me that's not a big deal, because I'll wait in the states for a great restaurant all the time."
Everything on the menu is fantastic.
Great selection of beers (I had a great Chimay) and great sangria.
The prices were great too.
"As for service, it's very friendly."
They speak enough English and don't make you feel uncomfortable if your Spanish/Catalan is not great.
And they'll make great suggestions.
They definitely won't rush you even though people are out on the street waiting for tables.
A fun mix of locals and visitors.
An overall great experience.
Good Friday at the Kudu Bar was a really great night with the live act Soul Revival.
The bar was buzzing and the food offered that evening was truly delicious.
This is a place that I regularly like to eat at and since Ross and Vicky took over in December things have dramatically changed.
"If you are looking for a place where you can get great food at reasonable prices, then this is the place to go."
As well as them now doing barbeques at the weekend and during week you can enjoy a great tasting steak on Tuesday nights when it is 2 for 1 or Barry's (the chef's) fajitas again 2 for 1 on a Thursday night are absolutely amazing.
Great Indian restaurant.
Great deals on both set menus and from the main menu too.
Starters were ok- not the best we have had but we went late on at night and they were slightly dry- the dips etc are however marvellous.
The main courses- well......no words can descibe the food we received- absolutely amazing and i'm salivating at the thought- please go and try this place!
we spent one evening there and it was the best atmosphere and food that we had all weekend.
we were sorry not to have eaten there every night.
They also do breakfast.
Food wonderful and soooooo fresh.
Prices are sensible and atmosphere great.
This is what Barcelona is all about
This is a fantastic Cerveceria!!
"The food is really good (you can find especially fresh fish and good vegetebles),the beer and the sangria are excellent too."
The atmosphere is nice but the restaurant is very crowded(we waited more than an hour to have a table..)but it's worth waiting!
I have been going to Sitges for years and this resturant is such a wonderful relaxing place.
"The food is fresh, the Chef Valen shops locally and everything tastes great."
I went to Lateral in Madrid with my daughter in March and I am just now getting over the bacteria that I got from the food I ate.
After eating at the restaurant I woke up the next morning with a terrible stomach ache and all the rest that goes along with it and when I got back to the US after two weeks of not getting better got tested and found out I had a food borne bacteria that I needed to take antibiotics for two weeks to cure.
Not Fun.
The food was tasteless and they treated us like second class cititzens.
"We went to the Lateral (there are severalin Madrid) where they have a little back corner room off the bar ...that they told us was non smoking (we did not ask to be seated in the non smoking area, i mean the whole place ws basically smoking no matter where you were seated)."
It was like the sceen in Animal House when the Omega's put the less desirables in a room where the cool people would not see them.
We had been in Barcalonia for a week previous to going to Madrid and were treated great everywhere we went.
Do not go to this restaurant
the worst restaurant i have ever eaten in.
made me sick i couldn't even eat the food it look so disgusting.
the whole restaurant was smokey there was no ventilation at all.
the people were rude and mean.
the worst restaurant we went to in spain.
"Six of us ate at Fonda Caner last Tuesday and enjoyed the experience, despite service being slow."
"To be fair, most other restaurants were closed and the proprietor told us we would have to wait a bit."
We were offered cava and a little nibble while we waited.
There is a good choice on the a la carte menu and a range of set menus to suit all pockets.
"We can recommend the scrambled egg/mushroom/prawn starter (mine with the wild asparagus we saw everyone collecting locally was even better), and stuffed lamb shoulder and wild boar stew mains went down well too."
"Dessert trolley looked inviting, but we resisted the temptation."
"At around 27 euro a head including 2 decent bottles of local wine, it represented good value too."
"There are some other good dining opportunities in Begur amongst the restaurants mentioned on this site, just not on Tuesdays in April it appears!"
I visited barcelona in 2007. i saw the review in forums about this restauant so i went to try.
I cant believe the price on the menu...everything was around $10 or less.
the bill was around $20 for 2 ppl and we were so full.
needless to say the food was so good we went back for the 2nd time.
"This time, we got there around 7ish...when they are starting to let ppl in...but the line was sooooo long that we waited over 2 hrs to get in."
"Still, i think the food is sooo good and the price was sooo cheap that it's worth the wait."
the restaurant is a little hard to fine because it's located in a small alley.
I would recommend this restaurant.
I had a terrible experience while I was there.
First of all you have to wait more than 1 hour if you arrive later than 7 pm and finally when you can sit down the service treat you as an animal.
"I mean they don't even speak spanish, they want you out when you are done with the meal and they don't have time for anything you ask!"
It seems they only want to have the more possible tables.
Finally what really made me more furious was while paying.
They said to us that it was not allowed to pay the bill separated.
Obviously I couldn't believe that and after a discussion we paid as normal (they act like this because they don't want to waste time counting how much is each part of the bill).
Seriously as a Barcelona citizen I can't recommend this restaurant.
We have much better restaurants in terms of food and service.
"If you're a lover of paella, this is the place for you."
"But try to book up, especially if you go at weekends, since it can get crowded."
"The paellas here are better than any I've eaten in Valencia, which is where they originated."
"The atmosphere is bustling and lively, and the service is a little brusque and heartym but highly enjoyable."
Located on Pass.
de Gracia about 3 blocks north of Placa de Catalunya.
Easy walk from there.
"Nice place that does get a lot of tourists given its location but night we were there it was a mixed crowd of tourist families with kids, couples and young adult locals."
Good menu of Catalan based meat and seafood.
Our food was good.
The service sort of typical for the area (just get used to it).
Casual to dressy for dinner.
"Remember, earliest time for dinner is 8 PM and usually runs to midnight."
No tipping in Barcelona.
1.40 euro wines.
2 - 4 euro tapas.
"Comfortable, very large, spacious location."
"Waiters look like they belong on ""The Love Boat"""
This used to be a cinema and has now been refurbished and turned into very nice restaurant.
It is close to the Roman remains in Alcudia and they have decided on a Roman atmosphere in Satyricón as well.
Out in the back is a patio with al fresco lunch and dining.
The food is Spanish/Mediterranean and is very nice.
"The service was slightly stressed when we were there, but very friendly and the quality of the food and the general atmosphere made up for that."
"I haven't found an official website, but you can check out  http://www.mallorca-restaurants-121.com/es/restaurantDisplay.aspx?restaurantID=4774"
Excellent!
Hidden gem!!!
"This is by far one of the most fabulous, better presented and most convincing restaurants in Galicia."
"Miguel, the chef, makes an excellent job in a creative cuisine that remains local."
Ingredients are extremely fresh.
Presentation is modern and classy.
Taste is surprising and extremely comforting.
The Galician cuisine at its heights in this restaurant.
"No surprise if it gets a Michelin star pretty soon as, compared with some perks, this restaurant is outstanding."
Location is worth a detour.
Thanks Miguel for making our visits so enjoyable.
Strongly recommended!
"The food is amazing, the service attentive and the wine list devine ... in the week we are in Tenerife we always go at least twice!!"
!
perfecto!!
!
Super friendly and fast service.
Simple but great southern food and cocktails.
Good southern atmosphere.
I agree that the ambiance is wonderful and Els Pescadors is located in a great little square.
"Not just that, but the service is indeed excellent."
"The food however, did not live up to its price (nor did the portions)."
"I had been told by locals that this was the best fish in town, but I was sorely disappointed."
Service on terrace was so rude I never want to go back again.
They will not lack customers because view is great and restaurant is really well placed.
"Initially when we booked we thought it cost 40 Euros, which included a set menu."
We were wrong.
We prepaid 40 Euros per person for the show via credit card.
When we got there we found out it was 40 Euros plus the cost of a menu.
Menu prices range from 40 Euros per person to 90 Euros per person.
"The restaurant is small, the food OK, the show not worth it."
"If you're not Spanish, this show can not keep your attention for more than a few minutes."
"It got pretty repetitive, we left after 30 minutes."
"We are a family of 4, and it cost us over 350 Euros."
"Overall excellent dancers & a terrific experienmce, good menu & wine list, good service but too many people crammed into the available area/s."
"We do not enjoy dining 50 elbow cm away from other guests) on the tiniest table we've ever experienced (and where all conversations can be overheard) & because of this combined with the evening's price tag, we would go to another tablao next time."
"What a nice evening spent having a lovely dinner: good food, wine and especially friendly service."
You can choose between several menus; beware that you may have to eat your dessert during the show if you have taken too long to eat.
"There are 2 seatings: 8.30 and 12pm, and you can go to the show without eating."
"It was my first flamenco show and I thoroughly enjoyed it: dancers and guitar players had to make use of small space to dance, play and sing."
It was such a shame that I could not understand the language to appreciate it more!
"I have only been going to Benidorm for three years now, and on my first trip with my grandson he said lets try here (The Robin Hood) well best decision i have ever made, Barbra, Paul and phil made me so welcome, the food was stunning and the beer was cold, just how it should be."
"Barbra made my grandson so welcome it was unreal, then when my son and daughter came with me in 2008 the smae thing again, what a lovely welcome from all the staff, i would highly recommend this bar for the quality of everything they do here, i will be going back, not sure if this year though so all my love and best wishes to The Robin Hood, Barbra Paul and Phil."
From Marc Wilson & Family xx
Don't be deceived by the outward appearanc of this restaurant.
"From the street it looks like a typical, small Tapas bar with stools and counter."
"However, a maitre 'd quickly takes you down the long center lsle, past the small side tables and around the back corner, past the kitchen (open behind glass) to a stairway leading to the lower level which opens to a large dining room."
Magnificent!
We made reservations (suggested) for a party of 6 and were given a very large table (the table could probably have seated 8-10) in the non-smoking zone.
"Whatever they use to keep the smoke out works exceptionally well, didn't smell a trace of smoke all evening."
"The decor is understatedly elegant, clean with subdued lighting."
Excellent starters of a wide variety of traditional Spanish Tapas type plates.
"For main course, we all ordered various seafood dishes (hake, monkfish, cod, etc) which were fresh, delicious and very well prepared."
Extensive wine list.
"Desserts and coffee were good, not great."
The main course seafoods were the hands down winner and the reason I give this restaurant a high rating overall.
"The service was excellent, very professional with good personality."
"Pricing leans towards the upper side but worth it for the quality, quantity (you will not leave hungry) and service."
"If you like great Spanish seafood dishes, this is the place."
"This restaurant is amazing if you go to eat paella, expecially the lobster paella (paella de bogavante), it's quite expensive but it's really worthy."
Stay away fron the salads because they are expensive and not fresh at all!
!
"For those Hare Krishna people looking to eat at this ""Govinda"", this is not the usual Hare Krishna Restaurant that servers prasadam."
"Although the owner is an initiated devotee, his restaurant does not follow the principles very strictly (anymore?)."
"When we came in i tried greeting the staff with a ""haribol"" but got no response."
I tried to see if they were wearing kunti mala's but they were not.
So the staff are not devotees.
But since we were very hungry we decided to try it anyway.
"We tried to order something without onions, garlic and mushrooms, but the owner did not know the ingredients of the dishes on the menu."
"So we tried the veggie lasagna and picked out the mushrooms and onions ourselves.So if you want prasadam, then visit the ISKCON temple which is nearby."
The menu is quite variegated so you have lots of choice but the price can be high.
"We spend 50 euros with 2 people, incl drinks but no desert.!"
!
Great sushi!!!
"but it is expensive, and the place does lack a bit of ambience.... would definately recommend it to business people."
"We stayed for one week in Maspalomas with my girlfriend and after being almost depressed with the international tourist menus, this place was easily the best place we ate at."
Food was very well prepared and not overly complicated.
Simple and high quality ingredients and lots of lots of flavor.
Prices were relatively low and it was almost strange to pay same amount of money than in the restaurants in tourist centres and the food was actually very good.
The service was also remarkable.
The waiter was very skillful and made the dinner very enjoyable experience.
I highly recommend Salsete for everyone.
Location is a bit far away from tourist centres but taxis are cheap.
Great food at relatively low price.
"I went there for lunch on 07.04.09, and had Nardi's tasting menu, together with the restaurants very good 03 Ribera Del Duero."
"The restaurant is very good, and the food is presented very nicely - like the rest of Extremadura though, you need to be quite knowledgable about the Spanish language, because noone speaks any English."
However at nardi that wasn't a problem - the food was exquitite - so the language barriers were broken down by a great tasting experience.
"The restaurant, located in a small picturesque village in Spain, isn't very nicely decorated, which is a shame, however their cooking makes it worth a visit."
And a measely 36€ for the lunch menu makes it even more astonishing.
Had lunch there yesterday after visiting Baeza on our way to Ubeda.
"We were late, but no problem for Juanito's, we ordered the 5 courses Degustacion menu for EUR 36 pp and what a treat & nice wine menu, the best dining experience we have ever had in Andalucia (although too quickly served after eachother) and guess what, it's no secret: King Juan Carlos & Queen Sophia have been there several times: we rest our case: go there!"
!
I hadnt read the reviews as I only wandered past it yesterday and went back last night.
The front area gives no clue of what the main dining area is like but it is lively and bustling and we loved it.
Had mussels for starters and these were great.
But the Codfish Catalan was fantastic.
I've been to Rick Stein's twice and this wouldn't have been out of place there.
The waiter talked me into a 2euro more expensive bottle of wine and that was great too.
I'm not too sure whythe negative reviews from others but I'd go back without hesitation.
The only downside was a relative of Les Dawson playing the piano!
We had really looked forward to sampling the 4 Gats but they wouldn't let us in.
Even though we had their emailed confirmation they just rudely hurried us out because they had double-booked our table.
Not even an apology!
I really don't know how these sorts of places stay in business.
"food mediocre to poor and price considerable aimed at tourists, I don't believe any locals would be seen in there, let alone Picasso!"
Wine disasterous
"Creative restaurant, nice presentation, excellent service."
The food is very good and far from all the traditional dishes served in touristic restaurants of area.
Good value for money.
Other review below bears no resemblance to my experience.
"A warm, friendly place with excellent food and not over-priced."
"Its located right near the Barceloneta district, is very popular and so is not cheap!"
If you want cheap and tacky tapas bar there are a million other places to eat in Barcelona.
This is nice and smart and a lovely venue!
"Our hotel recommended this tapas restaurant to us, Lonja de Tapas, which we went to since it was close by."
"But it turned out to be way expensive for what they give, even though I had specified to the hotel that we were looking for inexpensive tapas."
"I think our hotel was in cahoots with this place & recommended it so they could get free food/drink themselves at a later date, since they insisted on making a reservation for us, saying the discount card for 2 free drinks wouldn't be honored without a reservation."
"We ended up going without a reservation, but sure didn't need one, as the place was empty!"
"They also happily honored the 2 free drinks card, so that was a lie."
"John had 2 tintos (glasses of red wine), I had one hot tea, and we shared 6 tapas, small portions (pinchos)."
"Total was 46 euros, or $61 USD."
Ridiculous.
The bill was this high even with the money-off brochure.
"When we got there, the manager was actively trying to inveigle people to stop by his empty restaurant by speaking directly to them and offering that same brochure for 2 free drinks... Now I know why."
"The food was mostly delicious, neither of us liked the croquetas though, but the rest was very tasty."
"However, the prices are way too high for a humble sidewalk cafe."
We had better luck just looking at menus with good prices as we walked around.
"The food in Barcelona, at the 5 or so places we visited, was outstanding & creative - especially if you like aioli which they use to flavor many items (garlic mayonnaise mixture)."
"The restaurant is situated on the north end of Placa Reial, in the middle of Barcelona close to La Rambla."
You can't reserve; you have to queue and people start queuing 30 minutes before to be sure of table when doors open.
Then the queue still present until the closing !
The food is excellent and the price really correct.
"All the dishes are very well presented bit some of them are not well filled, for that reason it is a good idea to take an entry (or to choose one of the delicious desserts)."
There are a great choice of good wine.
"After being in Spain a few weeks, I'll admit it: we were a little hammed out."
"So it was with great relief we found Ouh, Babbo!, an Italian restaurant tucked away near the Puerta del Sol."
"At first we weren't sure if we should try it, as the inside decor of red, white, and black was a bit off-putting and had more of an '80s lounge vibe to it."
"But the food, ooohhh the food, MORE than made up for any lack of design taste."
We were there for one reason: pizza.
"But quite frankly, we weren't expecting much."
"After all, this is Spain and if we wanted great pizza then we were on the wrong side of the Mediterranean."
Wrong!
"The pizza was absolutely delicious, from the crust to the sauce to the cheese and ingredients - it was crazy good."
"As good as any pizza we've eaten in Italy, and that says a lot because we've eaten a silly amount of pizza in Italy."
"Backing up just a moment (I was so excited to get to the pizza part), we were also presented with a little Italian tapas before our pizza, which was arugula wrapped in a slice of mortadella and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette."
Heaven.
"And, although we didn't have any pasta dishes, we eyeballed just about everything coming out of the kitchen and the other diners seemed extremely pleased with their pasta selections."
"Without question, we would heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delectable, quality Italian meal in Spain."
Because man cannot live by tapas alone...
just got back from this restaurant.
it started off great.. we hadnt read any reviews about this place and sat outside under a large umbrella which shielded us nicely from the rain.
we sat down around 7ish pm and started noticing a long long line of ppl waiting to get in.
our table was right at the front entrance.
the food was pretty good.. but the largely filipino staff was incredibly rude.
we ordered several tapas and a mixed paella (only option on menu) and i advised the waitress that i was allergic to shrimp and she told me it was no problem.. she would ensure that the chef did not put in any shrimp.
of course.. 25 minutes later.. it came with shrimp.
she wasnt apologetic and i practically had to beg her for another one telling her that i was extremely allergic.
she seemed annoyed.
then we noticed that they were clearing off all the outside tables and putting fancier table clothes on all the tables and changed the chairs.
i felt like we were being rushed out after waiting yet another 25 minutes for my correct order of paella.
we hadnt even finished HALF our food when the rude waitress gruffly told us that they pretty much wanted us out so that we can give the table to other ppl waiting on line.. even after we told her we were going to order dessert and coffee.
i didnt mind that we had to move tables.. or what have you ...but i felt like service was so abrupt and i was given almost nasty looks that i wasnt eating fast enough.
Shame on this restaurant.
this is hardly an excellent restaurant.. and why WHY there is a long line for this place is beyond me.
there were so many other restaurants within the same plaza with the SAME food.
"After eating mostly spanish food for a week, we were ready for something different."
I had read about Mamma Tina's on tripadvisor before I left so we gave it a try.
It was delicious!
There were four of us and we all shared our appetizers and main courses.
Every one of them was great but I would have to say that the black ravioli with mushrooms was probably my personal favorite.
We found the prices to be pretty reasonable.
It is a cozy space (as most places in Arcos are) so you might have trouble finding a table in the busy season.
"We enjoyed our animated ""Italian"" waiter."
"We have been visiting Nerja for over 20 years, and always make this restaurant our first & last visit.There is a typical Tapas bar where you can be served as well as fine dining.Very popular with the locals.Outside dining in the summer.The menu covers all tastes from local foods & international & all prepared by the owner Sergio."
Family run & welcomes children.Try the cold meat & cheese platter to start or the prawns in pastry.The steaks are fab.
"Infact the whole menu is a delight ,we have never had a bad meal.Portions are large.Open every night in summer.Check-out the specials of the day ."
The restaurante has an explendid service and food.
"Cheaper than the tourists restaurants rateds in tourism guides, like Botin."
"One of the best Madrid restaurants, not exclusively for meat."
First class wine menu
this is a great bar for lunch right on the beach.the food is nice and you just cant get better than being on the beach.
We ate here one evening and thought the meals were superb.
The restaurant was a little warm but the food and drink were very good.
It wasnt cheap but not expensive compared to tourist style restaurants that charge more for the location but supply poor quality food.
If we visit Barcelona again we will definately eat here again.
"After reading Rick Steve's book, we decided to try thiw restaurant."
It was way over priced for what it was.
The waiter completely ignored us through the whole meal.
"For a 200 euro dinner for 4, I expect good service."
"Besides a large German tour, we were the only ones in the restaurant."
There are better restaurants in Barcelona and I would not recommend this to anyone.
Excellent Italian restaurant in La Caletta.
"Interesting menu, good selection of wines, nice location overlooking the sea, good service, child friendly while still being attractive to couples, wide selection of ages, good bar / cocktails all in all very nice spot for a meal."
My boyfriend and I went to Hisop for lunch today after reading great reviews in the New York Times.
"The waitress spoke English and was very nice, but it was unclear by the menu (and by her description) how much our food and wine would cost."
"It showed on the menu that a tasting menu was 48 euros a person, but we were pretty sure we didn't order that, since we each chose a starter and a main... until the food started coming out, and we had an incredible 5-course meal with many unique flavors and textures."
"The presentation of the food, as well as the service, was impeccable."
"I was certain we had gotten the tasting menu, so sure that I bet my boyfriend that we had, and that our bill would be 120 euros."
He said 70.
Whoever was closest would be the winner.
"When the bill finally came, we were both shocked-- 65 euros total (including two glasses of excellent Catalan wine and sparkling water)!"
Each 5-course meal was only 25 euros each!
I was glad that I lost the bet because we got such a great deal and a truly incredible culinary experience.
"If you are visiting Barcelona, do not miss this restaurant!"
"If you're a lover of lamb, this is the place for you."
"It pays to book, since you'll get a better table in the restaurant."
"The service, wine and food are excellent and reasonably priced for the extremely high quality of the food."
"Whilst we went to the c / Preciados establishment, near Plaza Callao, I feel confident enough to recommend any branch of this excellent restaurant chain."
"But note: lamb is their speciality, so if you'd prefer something else I suggest you don't go."
Summing up the Pergola is simple.
"Home made, clean food that won't cost the earth."
"A little rustic Italian restaurant, close to the post office and booking is advised as it is often busy."
The owner Paco is so friendly and greets you like a long lost friend.
My favourite dishes are the seafood pasta and stewed veal.
"Finally no trip is complete without having a tiramisu to finsh, if you have the room."
My favourite place.
We went to this restaurant for 3 nights out of 7.
Wish we had gone every night.
Lovely peaceful atmosphere and nothing was too much trouble.
Really different to all the otther places and it had food that made us go mmmmmm!
The kids loved it - clean plates!
"If you are visiting Puerto Rico, make the effort to try this place."
It's really easy to find and you won't be disappointed.
Very good tapas - the best we got during our visit in Spain (8 days) - and the wine list is utterly impressive!
"If you have a chance, go and see these people."
"At one point we had the owner, th ewaitress and two guests discussing where a certain location was .... brilliant!"
This place is where the locals meet - but you can still come in as a tourist and be very welcome.
"The prices are a bit steep - but on the other hand, the quality is through the roof!"
"I found a great tapa place downtown Malaga, they don´t serve real Spanish food, but a great selection of etnic tapas: hummus, kofte with Spanish taste, original selections of salads, curry chicken, empanadas and a short but nice selection of wines."
"The owner speaks French, English and Spanish."
It has become a place where people meet for language exchange.
"They open at 2, but they said that during summer they will open a bit earlier for the turist."
it Is just 2 min.
"from Picasso´s House in a little walking road near a theather, really fresh during the hot weathers... Ah!"
the price is really good... don´t miss it!
Four of us visited the Jumbo Chinese restaurant by accident the first time.
We had gone to the Tipico Canario but it was clearly very busy - so we checked out the menu of the next door Chinese restaurant.
"Friendly waitress ""Penny"" persuaded us to try the ""Feast"" for 4 people at Euro 12 pp."
Wow - what a lovely meal!
"It was: - Chicken and Sweetcorn soup - Barbecue ribs (loads) yummy - 1/2 Crispy Duck with all the pancakes, hoi sin sauce etc."
"that we needed - King Prawn curry, sweet and sour chicken, chicken satay, sizzling beef + egg friend rice All the dishes were full sized and not, as often with such combination meals, small portions."
In fact we had enough left over to take several portions home for later.
Everything was of the highest quality Cantonese cooking (one of the waiters said that he came from Macau) The drinks were all very reasonable and the service outstanding - we were never left waiting yet neither were we rushed.
The young staff were great.
The bill for 4 of us was Euro 64.
Excellent value for a fantastic meal.
Towards the end of our vacation we did a rerun of the meal.
Equally good.
They even let us substitute a couple of the main course meals...
Found this tapas bar by chance.
Short walk from centre with views towards the Alhambra.
Enjoyed tapas with first drink so much that ordered our main meal from tapas selection on menu.
If you want to try out delicious portions of local specialities then try the broad bean and bacon or aubergine and honey (sound strange but tastes delicious).
Beware of the narrow street and speeding traffic especially when admiring the views.
There are really excellent food.
Long list for wine.
Waiters very professional.
It's possible smoking inside.
"This is a takeaway pizza place, you can call them and they deliver, or you can buy it there and take it with you."
Don't expect tables or anything like a restaurant.
"It serves mainly Pizzas in the style of other fast food chains such as Pizzahut or Telepizza, but at more competitive prices."
"If you are going to order from one of the big chains, try this place first, they are more generous on the sizes (medium is the smallest pizza they make) and you don't need to order extra cheese cause they usually put enough cheese on as a general rule."
Plus it's nice to order from a local business as supposed to a big national or multinational corporation.
"I order from here quite often, it's a good way of eating for less than 10 Euros (if you don't eat loads, a medium pizza will be enough for two, so that's less than 5 Euros a head)."
"We arrived at the restaurant close to their closing time (midnight on Saturday), so waiting for a table was not an issue as other reviewers have mentioned..."
"However, the restaurant was nearly full considering how late it was, there were only 1 or 2 tables open."
"Our meal was excellent, we ordered two very nice appetizers along with two great entrees, a bottle of wine, and a dessert for roughly 40 euros!"
"It was a fantastic value, much more reasonable than other nearby restaurants."
Relaxing yet trendy atmosphere and prompt service.
All I can say is we were extremely pleased with our experience...
Highly recommended!
This restaurant is to be highly recommended.
The ambience for a romantic tete a tete or a family get together is superb.
The food is beautifully presented and is cooked to perfection.
My husband and I always make sure we have at least one evening at the Aroma each time we visit Fuengirola.
"The last time we visited the Aroma we took four of our relatives, one of whom is particularly difficult to please, but he came away from his meal with a smile on his face."
We had the menu of the day which cost €15 a head for three courses.
"The choices for each course was extensive and we all had different things from the menu, not one person complained that they had not enjoyed their meal."
If you are ever in Fuengirola and require a decent meal then the Aroma is the place for you.
"This restaurant has everything, superb food, excellent service, beautiful decor and very acceptable prices all this together with a great atmosphere."
I' ve been there a number of times now and I just can't stop going back.
"You do need to book though , I think that says it all."
"Had lunch here one Saturday in March, with wife, two small kids."
"Staff helpful, smiley to the kids."
"Service was a bit slow, which was hard for 4 year old who was all set to march into the kitchen and demand his food!"
But it is Spain... and the food was good.
"Paella, lots of huge tasty prawns, swordfish nicely done."
Would definitely go back.
I can't recommend this place enough.
"My girlfriend and I wandered in one evening, tempted by the decor and atmosphere of the place."
The €15 for 3 course menu also was a temptation.
The food was out of this world and the head waiter and waitresses were helpful and friendly.
"The only thing that wasn't perfect was that the service was a little slow (it was busy, however)."
I wouldn't let that put anyone off though.
"We used to go dylans bar every night, great cocktails, and even at lunchtime, lovely chicken cesear salads, yum yum.see you in august 2009 britannia is also one we frequently went in as it being next door.."
I love this place.
"While there are Michelin-starred eateries a plenty towards Marbella, this is the place I'd choose if we were thinking about a cheeky lunch out as a treat."
The food is excellent – far from ordinary – and the service wonderful.
"Christian, the chef, is a very talented man and his modern European menu boasts traditional Spanish ingredients with the occasional Asian twist."
"Great portions, beautifully cooked and presented, and a cosy atmosphere."
"Sit inside in the winter with the log fires burning, or out on the terrace on a warm summer's evening."
This is in a 11th century building in the hills in the north of the city.
Great to visit just for that.
This place is mainly locals and the food is very local from the salted cod to the sausages and other cured meats.
But this is a fine restaurant.
The grilled vegetables were great.
Helps to speak some Spanish (I don't) but you can get by fine.
Will need to have them call you a taxi at the end of dinner.
Great place for a Rioja or Ribera del Duero red wine.
Dress at all restaurants in Barcelona is mixed causal to upscale but no jacket & tie needed anywhere.
No tipping in Barcelona so enjoy.
Miau is not exactly special --it's tapas in the Barrio de Letras.
"But when you are traveling in central Spain and would give your arm for a light dinner of grilled vegetables, this is your spot."
"The raciones of verduras a la plancha and/or the trigueros (asparagus) a la plancha, when they are in season, followed by a very nice fruit salad, can be just the thing when you simply."
cannot.
eat.
more.
ham.
It's on the Plaza de Santa Ana.
Has a terraza.
This well-known Barcelona tapas bar close to the centre is not what it once was.
It's quite a few years since I was here last but prices are now too high for the variable quality food.
"'Pulpo' is their speciality and was fresh and flavoursome, if over salted, but at €13 for a medium portion is poor value."
The 'Patatas Bravas' - usually a good indicator of overall quality - were the big let down; tasteless potatoes disguised with an overly spicy sauce.
"Not all bad: the displays of Galician tapas are impressive, the room has an authentic and old-school feel and drinks prices are fair."
"But unfortunately the food its just not up to scratch, a pity as there is now a dearth of decent fairly priced tapas bars in the city centre."
Not recommended.
"No bad, but not great either."
"Service was really good though, and the special menu has is good value for money."
Seems to be very popular wiht tourists and locals alike
"Been to Nerja a few times and always found the El Puente offers excellent food, big portions and gives excellent value for money."
"Staff remain the same year in year out, good sign, and yes they do remember you and value your business."
"Highly recommended and used by locals, a good sign in itself."
arroces de lujo...
I had made a reservation for a group of 25 people and I needed to make sure that everything runs smoothly for that day.
I spoke to the manager and he was extremely rude and incompetent.
I ended up cancelling the reservation.
We returned from Tenerife on Sunday 26th April 09.
Four of us visited La Vieja and arrived after asking the taxi driver to drop us off at his favourite restaurant in that area.
"(We stayed in Playa Fannabe, Costa Adeje)."
Luckily we arrived early enough to be seated at one of the best tables outside on the verranda with the most superb view of the sweeping harbour and watched the sun set throughout our meal.
"Fish was excellent, service fantastic and very friendly, great atmosphere, stunning views a really fantastic memorable evening."
The Avocado Mousse & King Prawn starter was like nothing I've ever experienced before.
Amazing.
"Not cheap, as previously mentioned, but worth absolutely every single penny."
Super.
(I've attached a not great photograph of the view as its taken through the glass partitions around the verranda - but you'll get the drift!)
The CAMALEON is by no doubt the finest thing silencio has to offer the food in there is absolutely outstanding the chef MICHAEL even comes to your table to make sure that you are pleased with your meal how many other places do that????
They offer a varied menu with a daily specials board and on saturday evenings they do a meal deal where you have a choice of 2 courses for a set price.The restaurant itself is stylish and very welcoming LISA and TONY who own it are warm and welcoming and more than happy to help they even let us take our food back to the hotel on 2 of their plates as we could not manage to eat anymore well done Michael for filling us up!!!
And LISA and TONY for showing SILENCIO some class keep it up guys!!
!
This was our first visit to The Bistro (April 2009) - it was recommended to us by the owners of Plan B.
We were certainly not disappointed!!
"Whilst there is an a la carte menu, the fixed price main courses at 7 euros each were just superb and there was a good choice too."
"My husband and I both had sole in parsley sauce, my daughter had a vegetarian pancake and my son had belly of pork with wonderful crackling."
"There was a choice of chips, roast potatoes or mash and vegetables or salad."
"If you have any room left, there is a fabulous choice of home made deserts (bread and butter pudding, pavlova, cheesecake etc etc) at 5 euros each."
We had such a good meal (50 euros for 4 of us including wine) that we went back for a second evening and it was every bit as good the second time round.
"Go to this restaurant - if you want more info, visit their website - www.thebistrotenerife.com YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
!
"Excellent food, excellent price and excellent service."
This restaurant has all in one.
They open from Monday to Saturday from 7 AM to 1 AM (closed in August).
Big variety of food and extensive wine list.
"The place is nice, always crowded so maybe a bit noisy but still worth."
For me one of the best restaurants in Barcelona.
"Only one thing there are two Flauta's; one located in Calle Aribau 23 (which is the good and original one) and the other one, which was opened after the big success of the first one, located in Calle Balmes 164."
This last one is bigger but the food quality is worst than the other so if you can choice the original one because you know normally second versions are not the same.
"Went to the El Horno de la Aguela (Abuela) (= ""Granny's Oven"") on our first night in Playa Blanca (March 19 2009)."
I had the sirloin steak in pepper sauce which was excellent and the other three in our party had fish and chicken breast.
The fish was great but the chicken looked a bit dry.
With drinks (wine and beer) the bill for four came to Euro 64.
Paid with Mastercard...
The staff were very friendly and overall it was a great evening meal We had a bit of difficulty locating the restaurant.
It is beyond the end of the taxi rank on at the western end of the Avenda de Papagao (on the sea side of the road about 200 meters east of the roundabout).
"If you want a similar restaurant in that part of town, try the ""Los Hervideros"" which is up a road almost opposite on El Marisco - this is one of the most popular restuarants in PB with a great menu...and similar prices."
I came across this restaurant by a coincidence just biking around in Barcelona.
"The menu looked interesting and the prices very fair, so my girlfriend and I decided to go there a few weeks later."
"We arrived @ 21, and like in all other Barcelona restaurants the place was almost empty at that time."
"Arround 22 however the place was full...  We had a har time deciding on the courses, and agreed to order 4 different courses and 3 different deserts to share in order to try as much as possible."
First dish: Spinach and parmasan piroques in pumpin-creme.
"Very nice, could have been a bit warmer though."
Second dish: Tomato tartin with marinated codfish - very good!
"Third dish: Rissotto with 4 different cheses, apple and powdered iberian ham - very good!"
Fourth dish: Duck breast with apple something and cardemum - also very good!
"For desert we had:  ""chokolatissimo"" which was a warm chokolate muffin with liquid chokolate in the middle."
Caramellised Mango rolls with creme-chese and couli - excellent!!
Black and white chokolate cake with dark chokolate ice.
"With this we had a bottle of white, one glass of red, two water, bread and coffee, and we ended at the amazing prize of only 54 euro!"
I cant wait to go again and try some more dishes!
!
For anyone that's visiting Barcelona this place is a must.
"This is an iconic place for Barcelona locals and it does attract a lot of tourists, but that's because it's so good!"
I went for lunch last week with my girlfriend and we went right at opening only to realize there was already a line standing outside the closed door.
"The restaurant opened as soon as we got there but to our dismay, there were only enough seats at the bar to accommodate the people standing in front of us."
"So we decided to wait in line as we were the first up to be seated, we thought it would be quick since everyone was at the bar but we were greatly mistaken."
"It took an hour just for the first party to leave, and there were people from opening who were still eating when we left!"
Spanish people really love to take their time!
"On to the food, as soon as we sat down, all we said was ""Si"" and one of the cooks started preparing our dishes."
"The first dish was a fried medley of seafood including calamari, sardines, and small crustaceans."
It was very simple but the seafood was so delicious as you could tell it was extremely fresh.
The second dish was some sort of cheesey/ham tart which reminded me of quiche but was very Spanish.
I liked it but my girlfriend did not.
The last dish was cooked chickpeas with squid.
This was the best dish of the meal as I've never experienced such tasty chickpea and the squid was very fresh as well.
We had the option of eating more but we chose not to as we were both full and had a big dinner to look forward to.
"The three dishes with 2 beers came out to 65Eu/ Overall, this was a restaurant which you must visit if in Barcelona as it is such a staple."
But be warned of the lines that form out the restaurant and also be advised to sit at the bar as that adds to the overall experience.
The cooks cook everything right in front of you and you can see all the seafood stored in their glass refrigeration system.
Not cheap but you pay for the experience.
"This was the best meal we had whilst in Barcelona, the food was delicious, the wine was lovely and the service excellent."
A little hard to find - a tiny wooden doorway down a narrow alley way - but worth it for sure.
Perfect for a romantic meal for two.
After reading the time out review we tried the fig icecream and it definitely lived up to it's promise!
!
Menu choice is limited but food was fine and a great atmosphere.
Excellent value for money.
"We were 2+2 teenage children, proabably a bit smokey for younger children."
Evening visit so not sure if theres outside tables during the day.
We had originally booked a restaurant called the 4 Gats for a party of 17.
When we got there they had double booked us so we were in a bit of a pickle.
The Rossini on Place Reial was the only place that could fit us in and we all thought that a touristy restaurant like this would be well below par.
What a pleasant surprise!
"The food was superb (try the goats cheese salad with the fruits of the forest dressing), the service was second to none and it all came at a reasonable price with a superb setting in one of Barcelona’s nicest squares."
"This is the first time I´ve bothered reviewing something myself, I usually play the lurker - reading other peoples opinions in order to find out where I might eat, sleep, drink etc."
And it´s no random occurance that this happens to be my first review... without getting into some lengthy meaty mess I´ll just point out the few things which sum up this restaurant; undoubtedly of the very best in its class.
There´s nothing pretentious about the place.
"The decor is simple, the place itself is discreet... so much so that we found it difficult to find."
The food is what it´s all about - and Shunka nails it.
There is a bar and open kitchen where you can see everything being prepared.
Everything´s served quickly and the quality is absolutely brilliant.
Tuna belly.
Yum.
The staff and service was brilliant.
Having come from France the day before it was a delightful change from the places we had gone to where we felt we were doing the staff a favour by being there.
Another welcome contrast was the price....
It ended up being one of the least expensive places we went to during our stay.
It´s the best Japanese I have had in a long time.
"Hell, it´s the best I have ever had."
I highly recommend.
"Note - the place doesn´t open untill quite late, and that includes reservations."
Make sure you know where you´re going beforehand!
There´s no music inside.
A little ambience wouldn´t have gone amiss.
We visited this Restaurant and sat outside for lunch based solely on good Trip Advisor reviews.
We are big 'La Tasca' Tapas fans back in the UK and wanted to taste some authentic Tapas while in Mallorca.
"We were very impressed with the food and enjoyed the Cod Croquettes, Tuna & Tomato and Prawns in Garlic & Olive Oil between 2 of us."
"The bill with a Beer and G&T was 38 Euros, which seemed reasonable compared with other Restaurants in the area."
The waiters looked like they couldn't be bothered at times but the food came in good time and we had no complaints.
"Oh, if you are looking for this place using Google Maps it shows you the wrong location."
Just head for the ferry terminal peninsula (on the left as you come from Santanyi) and the Restaurant is on the opposite side of the road overlooking the Marina.
Best parking is probably the underground public car park in front of the Cathedral.
Visited on a Thursday at approx 2pm.
Packed and waited approx 20mins for a table.
"Quite smokey atmosphere although can be quite common in Spain, Food arrived quickly and service was ok although have has friendlier."
Had approx 5 or 6 of the tapas dishes and none were great - just ok.
"Didn't try the squid like some people had suggested,  Also felt teh portions were quite big for 2 people - we went to another tapas place where you could order 1/2 portions (at less than half the price of here) and this was more tham adequate."
We couldn't finish the peppers or the meat thererfore seemed like we were paying a lot.
Five of us went to El Chipiron for an early lunch on Easter weekend and it is genuinely no exaggeration to say it was the worst restaurant any of us had ever eaten in throughout our entire lives.
This is a tourist trap in the port area in Barcelona and if they have ever had repeat business from a customer I would be very surprised.
"The food was quite remarkably bad - in fact, the chefs at this eatery managed to destroy dishes that a five year old could knock out."
Surely it is not possible to get a margherita pizza wrong?
"Try huge quantities of bland, gloopy cheese and no flavour whatever."
"One quarter of the pizza had a few herbs sprinkled on, so I ate that bit."
"Now, I don't like seafood, which is a problem in Barcelona - but two of my fine travelling companions did order from the extensive selection of fish, and they managed to destroy that as well."
Calimari - surely that can't be too difficult?
Wrong.
"One ordered battered cuttlefish, and couldn't finish it."
This man once microwaved a half-eaten kebab the morning after a night out and happily ate it - but he couldn't finish his lunch at El Chipiron.
"Trying to walk off this disgraceful meal on the beach, I decided I would rather kick sand into my own face than ever eat in this restaurant again."
I actually stopped believing the concept of good food could exist.
Never go to El Chipiron.
"Even if you are unbelievably hungry and think it can't be that bad, don't go there."
It is that bad.
If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would.
"In fact, if I could give this restaurant minus 5,000,000 stars, I would."
Great location by the marina.
"Busy too, but only because all the other nearby restaurants were closing."
"Our waiter was good to be fair, but the food was very poor as was the managers attitude overall."
"Clearly they rely on tourists - try it once, but never return!"
"The food is hit or miss, some things are good, some are not."
"It lives off its reputation only, not its stellar food."
I have been there 2x and it was good then ok. Service is very good.
"Its ""traditional"" spanish food."
"There are some amazing restaurants in Madrid, and this is not one of them."
"Stayed in Barcelona for my 21st birthday in March and booked this restaurant having seen the photos and descriptions on the internet and because of the fantastic location on the beachfront, with the terrace opening right out onto the beach."
"Very unfortunately it actually rained the day we had booked the restaurant, however I can imagine it being a very nice touch in the summer months."
"The decor in the restaurant was as incredible as it looked on the photos, with the black and red Japanese theme, lighting effects and a ""bamboo forest""."
We decided to only order a main and a dessert from the menu as the prices seemed steep.
"Websites recommended that a typical 3 course meal at Shoko would be roughly $30, however it was typically on the plus side of $15 Euros for a starter, $15 Euros for a main and $10 for a dessert, with cocktails costing around the $10 mark."
"This obviously isn't helped by the weak pound, and would probably have seemed reasonable a year ago."
"There was a large selection of oriental and mediterranean foods on the menu, including meat dishes, fish dishes and even sushi."
"We ordered a Kangaroo Wok, Green chicken curry and 2 chocolate brownie desserts."
I cannot fault the quality or the presentation of the food- truly fantastic.
"The service was very attentive upon arrival and during the meal, however once we had finished our meal we were left waiting for the bill for an hour, despite having asked for the bill a couple of times."
"The staff walked past us several times, not taking the hint that we had even put our coats on to leave, and we felt like we were invisible."
"They seemed too busy with transforming the restaurant into a club, however with it being a tuesday not during the high season, there were only 4 occupied tables in the whole restaurant so not much of a club atmosphere and we were ready to leave."
"Eventually one of the door men noticed us and went to sort out the bill, which seemed ridiculous given the number of waiters to the number of customers dining in the restaurant."
"The bill that was also wrong, charging us for 3 main courses and extra drinks than we had ordered, and again we were left standing at the bar for a good while for this to be sorted out."
"Overall, we enjoyed the unique theme of the restaurant and the lovely food, however the whole evening that we had planned at Shoko did not live up to expectations."
"Perhaps if we were to go in the middle of summer, on a weekend when it is sunny and a bit more lively, then it would be fantastic."
"As fancy as the restaurant was, to be honest we actually enjoyed dining in one of the quaint restaurants just off Las Ramblas on another night of the holiday."
"There we got a large seafood paella to share, a jug of Sangria, and 2 desserts all for just $30, all served in a friendly atmosphere with a smile."
Having read the reviews on this restaurant on tripadviser we sought it out and were not disappointed.
"The staff were attentive, the atmosphere convivial and the food was excellent."
"Our two starters were mouth-watering, our main courses of entrecot steak and a brochette of monkfish and king prawn in an orange sauce and our traditional pudding were well presented, cooked and reasonably priced."
"This was a very popular restaurant, so we would definitely recommend booking."
The food is simply first class- one of the best chinese meals we have even had and we went more that once during our stay.
"None of the dishes we had were disappointing and we ordered from the full menu rather than order one of the numerous excellent set menus they have at very, very reasonable prices including vino!"
I have also never witnessed such brilliant service in such a busy restaurant.
"It is at almost full capacity at all times it seems, but you will be greeted within seconds of entering by the friendliest and most professional staff and told when a table will be ready- usually within 5 minutes."
They truly are awesome here and there should be a TV programme made for hospitality/restaurant staff and owners to show how it should be done.
Please also try the lychee liqueur and the flower Liqueur San Hua jiu- at 54% they definitely add a spark at the end of the meal.
Brilliant- would go back to Benidorm just for a meal here!
From when you walk in the door to you leave the staff make you very welcome.Food was great-excellent value.The owner greeted every patron coming through the door and remembered them if they had been before.Nearly every person was a returning customer.
I visit this restaurant after seeing the high ratings on this site.
Due to these ratings I expected to find a Chinese restaurant at Michelin level like in some other countries.
But I guess this is Benidorm.
One more reason to stay away from this town.
"When my wife & I visited Benidorm last week we went to two Chinese, Los Amigos on Calle Gerona @euros4.50 & China Garden @euros4.95 both roughly the same menu,both were excellent,but what makes the China Garden the better is the atmosphere with Yua the hostess & owner?"
just look at her welcoming diners & visiting your table is a joy to be hold.
"This is a very good place to eat in Madrid at honest prices, the meat and paella are delicious, just like the starters."
"Also Juan himself, as an dedicated owner, is very atencious and helped us as few would do when we had a trouble with a taxi."
"Nice place, I'll definitively return."
"My wife and I enjoyed our visit to this restaurant a year ago, so decided to give it another visit (which is sometimes a mistake.)"
The food was just as good as we remembered.
This time my wife had the duck cooked to perfection and I had a medium rare steak served with a gorgeous blue cheese sauce.
A very acceptable house red wine complimented the meal.
"Service was excellent and the staff very cheerful, friendly and efficient."
"Clandestino is now on our list of favourites and we shall travel to Malaga again soon, if only to visit this restaurant."
Where to begin?
"Let's start with the manager of the 'Best Restaurant in Barcelona'...there are only a few words to describe him...inhospitable, rude, incapable of organising anything and clueless!!"
"During our meal at Opium, we called upon him on several occassions and on every one of these, he ignored us."
"All we wanted to do was ask why our food was wrong, cold and why only half of our party of 13 had their food."
We selected this restaurant as it had been recommended to us but I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.
"The service was hideous, the manager rude, the food inedible, pretentious and over priced."
Although it is worth mentioning that the waiter that we had was polite and brilliant!
"If you would like to be insulted, looked down on, threatened with arrest, given terrible service (at the hands of the manager himself!)"
"and ripped off all in one night, then please go to this club/restaurant."
Self confessed as the 'best club' in Barcelona we were treated like pieces of dirt.
"Our food arrived cold, the orders for several people were wrong, when they eventually arrived after everyone else had finished, they were wrong again."
"The manager ignored us all night - everytime we tried to ask him a question or order a drink, he blatantly ignored us, he then threatened to have us arrested because we said that we would not pay all the bill due to the horrendous service, he told us that this was Barcelona and not London and that we could not talk to him like that!!"
It was an absolute embarrasment.
Incidentally our waiter was so mortified by his boss's behaviour that he was apologising - he was very nice and accomodating and was the only thing positive about the whole experience.
Its also worth saying that the restaurant's look and feel is stunning - all white and serence - the setting is beautiful - but the subsequent service marred the whole experience.
We had 3 wonderful meals at this restaurant in Cordoba.
The food and the staff were excellent and we also had a wonderful experience visiting the wine cellar.
The wine list is very extensive and also not overpriced.
"The salmorejo is absolutely delicious and so are the following dishes: Wild Boar, Venison, Delicious charcoal cooked steak, fresh fish, etc."
"If we do go back to Cordoba, would certainly return here for the delicious food and wine."
Times catch up with every place.
"El Churrasco is a local institution, but the food has been pretty disappointing the last few times I've gone..."
I have just returned from 5 days in Girona with my wife and we stopped at the Peninsular hotel which is directly opposite Bromsoms.
At first sight this place doesn't look anything special but we ate there a couple of times and the staff couldn't be friendlier and the food is good and inexpensive.
11 Euros for the daily menu or a selection of Tapas from about 2.5 Euros.
"The first time we ate there was on the evening of St Jordi's Day and all the ""better"" restaurants were packed; although every table was reserved at Bronsoms they squeezed us in and we had a great time."
"If you are staying in Girona I can't recommend this place strongly enough, especially if you are on a budget"
"Recommended to us by our hotel - the food, wine, service and friendly relaxed atmostphere made this one of our favourite restaurants anywhere."
There's only 8 tables so booking is essential.
"It's not cheap, but compared with many it represents great valie for money."
I went with my finace on a recent trip to Barcelona and the meal was outstanding.
We did the surprise menu and the wine pairing- what a treat!
Everything was delicious.
I have to say that I never would have found this restaurant were it not for TripAdvisor.
I was visiting Barcelona for the first time last week and did a lot of research by buying three guide books (one solely on restaurants) and not one had mentioned Con Gracia.
It's a real shame b/c this is truly a hidden gem (location-wise as well as food-wise).
I went on a Thursday night with my girlfriend and was glad to have made a reservation over a week in advance as the manager told us they were fully booked that night as well as for the next few weeks.
"The restaurant had a simplistic decor but was cozy, they only had 5 or 6 tables."
The manager was Swedish but spoke a lot of languages fluently and was very kind and helpful to us.
"He was also a very knowledgeable sommelier and educated us on different Spanish wines before helping us select a fantastic red wine from the Montsant region, anyone eating here must utilize his knowledge of wine as it is simply incredible."
My girlfriend and I both chose the surprise menu w/5 dishes based on others reviews here and we were not disappointed...the first course was foie gras with garlic chips that was absolutely delicious.
This was followed by a tuna sashimi with seared scallop that was also very tasty.
I've forgotten what the third dish was but I remember it being an excellent seafood dish.
"The fourth dish was rabbit, perfectly cooked."
The dessert was a very unique creme brulee with some type of side item (forgotten this as well).
"All in all, this was the BEST restaurant we ate at in Barcelona (the other restaurants we ate at were Cal Pep, Comerc 24, Hisop, La Estrella, Tapioles 53, La Tomaquera and Bestial)."
I am by no means a food snob or expert but I really do enjoy fine dining and good wine and this restaurant is absolutely not to be missed for both.
The bill came out to 170Eu but we ordered a 50Eu bottle of wine.
The surprise menu w/5 dishes is 45Eu and w/4 dishes is 40Eu.
Definitely worth the money.
Thank you TripAdvisor for making us aware of this culinary masterpiece.
I will definitely be returning on future trips to Barcelona.
The evening started off badly through absolutely no fault of the restaurant.
"The taxi driver struggled to find the restaurant and didn't as it turned out, but we were close."
Unfortuantely the torrential rain meant we arrived looking a little drowned.
"The waiter/manager spoke excellent English and I would reccommend calling the restaurant from the cab if you have a mobile phone, as they will undoubtedly guide the taxi driver to them."
I had expected somewhere larger and with a bigger menu.
Again my fault for having mixed up my web sites when researching.
"The service here was brilliant, you really couldn't fault it."
They changed the menu to suite our tastes and what arrived was simply sublime.
"Every detail had been thought about, the look of the glasses, cutlery, plates."
"Two managers, I assume maybe owners, showed us and the other diners enough attention to satisfy our every need without being at the end of our table for the whole evening."
"We booked an early table which was a poor move, simply as the restaurant filled as we were finishing."
"It is a small place with maybe 7 tables in total, but certainly one you shouldn't miss, you'll walk away with a smile."
Oh my goodness I love the Trip Advisor.
We went here because of the reviews and it certainly lived up (and more) to the high praise.
Before we went I reserved on line.
The director/manager was really good when we asked him how we could get there from the Magic Fountain we were going to earlier and even suggested timings etc.
Service over and above I thought.
We were greeted by some free cava - always like somehting free.
Like some of the others we went for the 5 course suprise menu with the wine tasting.
"First frois grois then tomato consume, then tuna and pigs trotters, then a kind of panacotta with raspberry coulis."
"Me order or eat pigs trotters - I don't think so, but that was the beauty of the menu, you ate what was put down in front of you and their judgement was spot on."
It was fabby.
"Ok, that's only 4 courses I know but I am having a blank moment."
We were quite merry when we left (cava then 5 different types of wines).
"Bill came to £173 - ordinarily that would be a 'yikes' moment, but that just shows you how fabby it was - it was worth every penny."
Save up and visit!
Words do not exist to describe how great this place is.
It's located about a 5-10 minute walk from the Diagonal metro station near the Passeig de Gracia.
It's easy to get to but you have to know where it is...it's a small space on a small side street you would never just come across on your own.
There are 8 tables in the restaurant and they do about 10 reservations a night so book way ahead.
I didn't know that when I went in there my first night in town but got lucky with a reservation for the next night.
"The 2 guys (I think they're both owners) who run the place are very knowledgeable about their food and ingredients, as well as their wines."
They're extremely friendly and they speak great English.
It's as if they really want to get to know their guests but they definitely leave you alone to eat and enjoy your company.
"The decor is modern and simple, but elegant."
The service is extremely attentive without the snotty factor that you might expect at restaurants of this quality.
Just friendly.
Others have mentioned the wines being overpriced.
"That may or may not be true, but I had a great bottle of a Spanish red wine for 40 euros and thought it to be a very reasonable price."
I agree with everyone else: DO THE SURPRISE MENU (around 45 euros each).
You will not be disappointed.
The food was simply outstanding.
"They ask you what you like, what you don't...you can even call ahead to ask for something special and they'll do it."
"As for the wine, if you want, they'll even ask you what your price range is (as they have bottles ranging from about 25 euros all the way up to over 500 euros) and they'll bring something great."
I overheard them mention their #1 TA ranking.
They're aware of it and they're proud of it.
"Quite simply, they are trying to provide the perfect dining experience."
And they succeed.
It was perfect from start to finish.
I will visit this restaurant any time I return to Barcelona.
"For my wife and me, it came to about 150 euros total, including the bottle of wine...while expensive, it's an absolute steal of a value."
A comparable restaurant in New York or Paris would easily charge twice as much.
One last thing.
"They did mention that it's common for a couple reservations to not show, so if you cannot get a table, you might just try dropping in around 10 or 10:30 and just asking."
One couple that came in after us did so and they got a table.
"Overall, a great ""special occasion"" place...for me, it was perfect for the last night of vacation before returning home the next day."
Yes like everyone else we had read the reviews and decided one night we would try this restaurant.
The hotel booked us a table.
I would just like to say we thought this place was going to be average in price as we read in trip advisor that dishes start from £1 or euro so when our bill arrived at £175 we were a tad shocked...... but it was expected .
Upon arrival we could see this place was going to be special and it was.
The food was amazing the surpirse menu worked well.
Its not often one pays a large sum of money for a mystery meal but it was exceptional and the two hosts offered excellent service.
We went to Con Gracia for lunch during our recent trip to Barcelona.
We picked Con Gracia after reading good reviews on the Trip Advisor.
"We picked the 5-course ""surprise"" menu with wine pairing - however, we were a bit demanding due to our dietary restrictions which included no foie gras, no sashimi, and no rabbit."
Our host was really gracious and suggested that we have a cheese course as one of the courses.
We started the meal with a glass of cava which was just delicious.
Our host brought us some spiced salts with 2 mystery ingredients to have with bread dipped in herbed oil.
"Throughout the meal, we tried to guess the mystery ingredients which kept the whole experience very interesting and memorable."
(We ended up guessing the 2 mystery ingredients correctly.)
"Our five course meal included risotto, chilean sea bass with lentils, duck breast with apricot and pureed eggplant, cheese plate, and chocolate parfait with meringue."
The wine pairng was absolutely perfect and gave us a chance to try some really excellent spanish wines we would not have otherwise.
"Every dish was just perfect - delicious, interesting, and memorable."
"Our host was very nice, had a great sense of humor, made us feel really special."
The price for the meal was really reasonable considering such high quality of the meal.
"We would put Con Gracia on the top of our list along with Gordon Ramsey's and Petrus in London, Alain DuCasse at Plaza Athénée, Masa's, and Picasso at Bellagio."
We would definitely go back to Con Gracia if we ever return to Barcelona (we can't wait!
).
We regularly visit Barcelona and without a doubt we make sure that we eat there every visit.
"The food is always fresh, service is always very good and the prices very reasonable."
Particular favourites are their pizza's and lasagne.
For dessert you have to try the tiramisu.
They also have a nice slection of wines and would rcommend the san asisclo.
"There are at least 3 Gino's in the city, with our personal favourite being in the maremagnum."
The restaurant looked ok and it was a Sunday so more limited options.
The food was really disappointing with even the basics (ex Jamon Iberico) done badly.
Orders that they tried to charge for were forgotten.
Simple things that are easy to do well like bread not much good.
Wine very average and fully priced.
Wish that we had searched longer and gone to the well reviewed Taberna de la Boveda round the corner that appears to put more effort in.
"After a tiring shopping day in the center of Torremolinos, we found this nice French restaurant, just one street away from San Miguel."
"The waiteress who attended us was very friendly, the food was gorgeous and the prices OK."
I specially recommend the Duck a L'orange !
It was delicious !
What an experience!
We went on Sunday night and it was busy but the atmosphere was great.
"Grab a plate, ask for a drink and away you go!"
"Loved the pintxos, the fish ones were especially tasty."
We had 17 pinxos plus 4 glasses of red wine for under 40 euros which I think is good value.
"Nice food, frienly service, nice place and atmosphere."
We certainly recommand it !
Don't forget to make a reservation
"I found this place through ""Tapas-Sevilla"" on my iPhone and it was great."
Our first impression was not so good because there was not menu card and the waiter just told us what they had for food.
"BUT once we ordered, everything went very very very well: food,service,drinks."
"That was probably the best ""Salmorejo"" in the world!!."
"I really recommend this place, but make sure to make a reservation."
We went on a tuesday night and it was almost fully booked.
I adored this restaurant.
it was amazing.. the food was delicious and the service was great.
the waiters were very friendly and the seating arrangement was vry comfortable..!!
although it needs some time for the food to arrive but it's worth the waiting... P.S: LOVE THE WAITERS..!!
:P
We popped in at 10 pm this evening.
Greeted immediately.
Tables were full and were we seated a great little intimate area.
Good service.
Reasonable prices (red wine 2.95 euros and fresh fruit smoothy 4 euros).
"Wonderful fun, friendly, and comfortable atmosphere."
Hope to return soon
Very good Italian food everything from italy.
Very good wine selection.
!
!Pasta pasta pasta!!
good quality food
"Visit this restaurant at least twice every holiday,great food ,great service,well worth a visit."
"The menu is in English, it is run by English people, the waitress is english (and charming) and there is roast lamb on the menu...... we had grilled vegetables as a starter (very good) followed by ostrich in onion sauce (tough and over-cooked) and mass produced ice creams."
A restaurant for the english.
Good value food in an excellent location just opposite the seafront in Moraira.
Salads and sandwiches for lunch are very tasty and well priced for the location.
I also like the comfortable sofas (added last summer) which makes it a great place for a pre dinner G & T or afterdinner coffee.
"The owners are Dutch but they provide daily newspapers in Spanish , English and Dutch, for you to use whilst you await your meal."
"(service can be a little slow at busy times, but its so relaxing there, you don't really care) Evening meals are quite creative and very good too."
This was the best meal we had on our trip.
"The steaks were fabulous, lovely Rioja, the service good and the surroundings atmospheric."
Ciento Lindo has for many years provided good quality food and good atmosphere.
But this year it seems to have gone crazy.
Instead of the focus on Mexican Food and good service they have gone for cheap tricks to advertise the restaurant.
Now instead of pleasant conversation and pleasant food you have lots of decorative lights and annoying people trying to create a false hospitality rather than a great place to eat.
"Instead of eating there three or four times in my two weeks stay, as I have in the past."
This time I have promised never to return again.
"We were in Barcelona for a girls weekend and this place fitted the bill, although equally it would have been good for couples too."
"We visited here every day of our visit, either for drinks and/or food in the restaurant."
We loved the decor and the bar has a real buzz - did not find it empty anytime we went.
Bar staff are efficient and friendly and at 11 euros for a bottle of house wine it doesnt break the bank.
We shared some nachos in the bar and these were delicious.
We ate in the restaurant two nights.
"The food was tasty and well cooked, although some of the portions could have been a bit bigger - I had salmon and it was just 2 small pieces with 2 scoops of swede and mash potato."
Some had pork and beef and these portions seemed larger.
The patas bravas were generous portions and the aioli delicious!
Main courses average between about 10-18 euros so plenty of choice.
would recommend this place as it has something for everyone!
After reading the reviews I knew I wanted to find this place.
Located in an alley near the Sta.
"Maria cathedral in the Born neighborhood, it's hard to find without a map but is worth it once you do find it."
We first tried a Friday night which was a mistake if you want a nice romantic evening.
The place was noisy with a 20-something crowd at the bar who all looked like they were having a great time.
"Loud music, loud conversations and smoke, I couldn't get through."
"Went back on Sunday evening and it was quiet, and found the restaurant towards the back after the bar."
"The service was excellent, food was great (my husband had the steak gorgonzola and I had the risotto), and the atmosphere is very romantic."
It's worth coming just to see the old architecture on the inside.
"I was surprised when I walked out that the bar was crazy again, but you couldn't tell from the restaurant where we were seated."
They do a nice job of separating the two.
"The staff speaks both Spanish and English, and are very welcoming."
It was a very helpful member of the front desk staff at our hotel Las Leteras (see review here) who recommended this great restuarant.
"Originally she tried for Casa Lucio, the more famous sister establishment, but it was fully booked and we were glad."
"This place is the real deal, excellent meat, and that old guard atmosphere."
"The decor is a non decor, faded yet pristine, the starched lined table cloths and napkins matching the gold buttoned jackets of the aging yet funny and professional staff .... English wasn't a forte yet sign language - pointing at other peoples rders - worked."
"Our aperitif was at the bar , a chill glass of white wine and a few tapas."
We ordered excellent oysters and a plate of delicious pata negra to start these went down well with a bottle of Marques de Riscal Gran Reserva 2003.
Maindish was the carrucco - sirloin grilled on hot plates - it was good.
Our only regret .. not orderiing those eggs and potatoes we saw every table of spanyard of all ages eat atound us .. Hueovos patates I think they are called.
We vowed to make it back and order them but we never made it .... later in life I hope.
Go there for an experience of Real Madrid .. shared with other visitors like you !
:-)
We were recommended to Passadis del Pep and had wonderful meals all over Barcelona but this was the worst for value and quality and service.
It is the ultimate clip joint be very careful.
They serve course after course and champagne even when we said we didnt want it.
We were told it was a set menu however they charge for everything whether you order it or not.
"Wish I'd found this place on previous visits to Barcelona, as I'm intending to eat here any time I'm back in town!"
"Even if you have to queue, and you probably will, it is always worth the wait ."
The concept is brilliant: 1.
Choose whatever you fancy from the raw fish counter at the door (by weight) 2.
"Pick how you'd like it cooked (broiled, fried, steamed, with sauce etc) 3."
Collect your order number (make sure you know what it sounds like in Catalan!)
4.
Pay for food and drinks at the bar and collect your cutlery and glasses  5.
Find a table 6.
Collect your food from the servery when they call your number (dishes will come whenever they are cooked - not all at once) Very fresh seafood cooked simply and unpretentiously.
Try the razor clams - they're brilliant.
Always packed out and with a lively atmosphere.
"Perhaps not ideal if you're planning romantic dinner for two, but fine for any other occasion."
"Wouldn't bother with the salad as, although it's a generous portion, it's pretty unimaginative - save room for more seafood."
Make sure you order enough food for your table before you leave the counter as you'll need to rejoin the queue to place a further order.
Recommended to all lovers of fresh seafood.
"firstly, you must be prepared to wait in the line."
"if you go 10 minutes before 8 - when they open , then you're smart."
"if not, then you'll have to sacrifice some time before you get to choose your seafood for dinner."
Wide range of seafood selections.
very fresh.
not expensive.
kitchen works very fast as well.
"Its kind of like a self service restaurant where you pick the food, pay get a seat and wait till the kitchen to call out your receipt number and you go pick up the food."
"once youre done with eating, you collect the plates and put it at this counter."
"Beer, and quite some selections of wines."
"its not a very posh place, but its good enough to just eat and feel all excited!!!!"
so goood.
went there twice in a row!!!!
!
"A fantastic restaurant, one of the best!"
"Food is brilliant, well presented and served by fantastic friendly staff."
"The food is imaginative and original, the chef is obviously a star!"
If you are in Corralejo it is definitely one not to miss.
"The little extras they do, handmade chocolate!"
Honey rum etc is lovely.
I miss it already.
excellent food with a gd atmosphere service was quick and friendly waitress very knowledgeable & told us the best places to go on the island for fishing & site seeing  goin back this year  thanks guys
Yup - agree with the previous reviewer 'just don't go there'.
The restaurant is brilliantly located right by the Cathedral but that is all I can say for it.
The food was ok but horrendously overpriced as were drinks.
There is a supplement for sitting outside in the road!
Good food.
Good service.
"Fun place to eat, Don't be put off if it's busy, the waiters are friendly (and patient with broken spanish), so just wait at the bar for a table or eat at the bar."
"This is located in the commerical or business district of Madrid and is down a street - take a taxi here, dont risk finding it yourself."
"Gorgeous restaurant - quite dark and only a handful of tables lit really well all circular and arranged in a circle with a real, huge olive tree being the focal point in the middle of the restaurant."
Staff are ultra professional and discreet - as you would expect for this level of establishment.
The meal includes really tasty amuse bouche - we both had the roast suckling pig for main.
A treat - quite expensive - looking at 50 pounds each equiv without wine.
High recommended!
hidden and great
"Fado rock is the best restarant I have ever eaten in abroad --people that have written bad reviews must be writing about the restarant oppsite called O fado, fado rock is run by portuguese and they are so attentive It's made me want to go to Portugal!!!!"
the portions are huuuuuge make no mistake don't order starters LOL!!
"never had room for a pudding but they still gave us freebies strawberrys in chocolate sauce free of charge, another day nacho's with cheese and prawn cocktail free of charge!!"
the rose wine is amazing!
"the best dishes I ate were seafood mixed grill MASSIVE I will attched a photo...also samon steak in garlic, and the tuna steak was enough for two people!!!"
anyone who write a bad review need to realise they are not writing about fado rock!!!
please dont get them confused cos FADO ROCK is calleta's gem!
we met loads of people and then saw then in the restarant every day for lunch and dinner everyone like us realised you can't beat there food!!!!
they have a man playing romantic songs live on a piano - heavan
Great atmosphere for dinner in Barcelona.
"If anyone knows the Max Group restaurants in Hartford, CT, this place is like that."
Upscale with mixed age crowd with well dressed 20's and 30's in solid attendance.
"Yes, tourists too but the well dressed kind from all over Europe and some US."
Food is Catalan high end and very well prepared and elegantly presented.
"thery have a more casual place downstairs where the bar is, but you want the main restaurant upstairs."
They also operate the best Japanese restaurant across the alley (pasaje).
North of Placa de Catalunya between Gracia and Rambla.
Good wine menu.
Go for a good Ribera del Duero with this meal.
Very nice decor.
Get dressed for a night out but no ties around here.
No tipping in Barcelona is a bonus.
This restaurant is probably better to just have a drink in.
The best part is the location - the tables are in a small sunny plaza.
"Average food, a bit pricey for Madrid."
"Vino tinto (red) was 2 euros per glass, the patatas bravas was 5 euros, and just mediocre taste."
It was 1/2 ration size.
"A pincho (small size) of Spanish tortilla was 2.50 euros, and again, my least favorite of all the ones I tried in Spain (out of 4 total)."
"Oh well, it was nice sitting outside there."
"Having used tripadvisor to highlight top places to eat in our recent 8 day stay, we visited The Ornage Tree restaurant."
"Location and atmosphere - close to front line and paloma park, without unfortunately overlooking either."
Menu and food quality - a wide selection (too much choice) and food appeared to be freshly-prepared.
"Service - good-natured and chatty whilst very busy, but staff do seem to be non-stop."
Value - more expensive than other places especially for wine so does not present greatest value.
Reaasonable.
Overall - would probably return if we are back in benalmadena
The El Naranjo restaurant is a def 10 out of 10 for me.
"Every time i have visited this restaurant the service, food and ambience have been brilliant."
"New specials have been added recently along with the famous shoulder for two, like the ribs for two and the surf and turf...the menu is great value for money and you also get a bottle of wine inc on the set menu and specials."
"The restaurant caters for all, highchairs available to those who need them."
:-) I highly recommend anybody looking for a lovely night out with beautifully cooked meal to visit this restaurant and to also to book because the tables go fast.
We have visited this restaurant on a number of occasions and have always had a great meal!
"We tend to opt for the special for two, which includes a shoulder of lamb, veg, chips/potatoes and a bottle of wine all for 27euros."
The restaurant is usually busy but the staff are very attentive.
"Also, they do a lovely banoffee pancake...which simply must be tried!"
We were recommended this bar / restaurant by friends who had been there the previous year so we thought we would give it a try and we were not disappointed.There is a wide variety of food from basic pie and chips to steak and fish dishes.
Paco and staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us.
"There was entertainment on every night from 9 till 12 o'clock and Dave and Sheila the geordie entertainers were excellent, there was always something going on for both young and older people.If you are looking for a quiet romantic place this is not for you but if you want a friendly family pub why not call in.It is not the easiest place to find but is next to the Bellvue complex under Siesta 3 apartments"
"You'd think in a Arab influenced town like Granada, you'd be able to find a good Arabic restaurant."
"If so, then we just picked the wrong place."
"Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't BAD, it was just very average."
The service was also slow.
The best thing about this restaurant was the beer...and it wasn't like they brew it there.
"Unless you are starving, avoid this place."
Its not worth it.
My husband and I were walking around ciutat vella/ribera and found this gem.
There are actually two separate shops.
One has a grand display of cakes and pastries that is fun just to look at.
The other is more of a cafe with seating and an expresso bar.
We sat just outside of the Santa Maria del Mar on Good Friday morning watching people come and go from church.
"For breakfast, we each had a cafe con leche and shared a chocolate croissant (which was amazing) and another small pastry."
Everything was freshly made and packed with flavor.
The service was great and our waiter opened up one of the large patio umbrellas when it started to drizzle.
Our total for everything was around 6 euros and worth every penny.
We would love to go back and try one of their beautiful cakes.
Had a superb paella there.
"Good service, pleasant surroundings, great food, proper linen table cloths and serviettes."
"Aprox £50 for 2 (dinner, dessert, bottle of wine and tea/coffee)."
Highly recommended.
"We went there for a tapas lunch, and boy we weren't dissapointed!"
"When visiting spain you're bound to at some point get tired of Iberian ham, potato omelet and sussage (I still love it - but at some point you just get pigged out) - when that happens, then go to La Musa - they have some unbelivably ingenious tappas, we had: Fried green tomatoes with jam port chop with a honney and egg crusting ... and a dish of potato with different sauces (I can't remember the details) The waiter decided for us, and we weren't disapointed."
"The restaurant is very nice, and very modernly decorated - definatrly worth a visit - at least for lunch..."
a very nice and confortable way to have the really best traditional food on a mordern-contemporary way.
Quality here is always guaranteed...amazingly good!
Price is really modest for what you eat.
Difficult these days to find such food and quantity for such a reasonable price.
We surely repeat our experience in many more occasions!
ENJOY !
!
This is where all the locals go.
"Make sure you eat the prawn pintxos, it's their specialty."
Their English is not that good so we were using out phrase book and they really appreciated it - the other customers thought it was really amusing but were so friendly they helped us order.
So much fun - eating and standing (no chairs).
Went to La Fonda as a treat with my wife and daughter.
It is located in the main tourist square of Valencia and is a 'proper restaurant' so is pricey (say £40 a head + wine for 3 courses).
"It is a small, intimate restaurant, with very good muli-lingual serving staff."
The bottom line was the food was excellent- very fresh fish and paella; excellent quality side dishes and home made desserts; good selection of wines.
I would recommend for a special treat (and as many other places in the old town are relatively poor quality).
On the Rambla?
In need of a quick but perfect food fix?
Tired of all the tourist traps?
Go to Taverna Irati ; just a few meters (yards) from the middle part of the Rambla.
The tapas selection from Euskal Herria (pays Basque) is irrisistible.
"It's 1,80 € per big fresh piece of exotic taste (about 2,35 $ US at the time I wrote this), wich means you can be satisfied and add a glas of wine or beer for under 15 €."
"Try the black sausage, the omellette, the sardines and the stuffed red pepper."
We have been coming to Coy for the past 12 years and it is great to come back each year and find that everything is just as good as it was the first time.
The restaurant is family owned and run (Tenerife Spanish family) and the owner and staff are consistently friendly and helpful.
"The food is ""to die for"" and the choice is superb."
The paella for two is the best I have ever tasted!
There are plenty of vegetarian options too and a good kid's menu.
"All in all, just go and experience it for yourself - you will not be disappointed."
I can't think of anything wrong with this place.
It may seem a bit pricey at first but you get good quality ingredients and an extremely clean restaurant with nice waitstaff.
"We ate here twice in our first week in Barcelona because I wanted something healthier to eat other than ham, cheese and fried food."
"The ramens and Udon noodle bowls are very good, and the green tea blend was like nothing I've ever tried."
"We went to the location on Montcada, near the Picasso museum."
We stumbled across Amanhavis when looking for a decent restaurant in Benahavis.
"Whilst many of the others are good and have plentiful portions, Amanhavis had that little extra quality and originality of food that we did not find elsewhere."
A little quirky in atmosphere and decor but still remaining very pleasantly surprising.
"Not the cheapest in town, but when did quality ever come cheaply?"
I do believe I could manage a stay at the Hotel if the standard of food is indicative.
"If you would like to eat the most amazing seafood, paella, prawns and squid, in a beautiful setting and pay less than 25euros a head the this is where you need to come."
In Port Olympic - you can't miss it.. it occupies about 8 shop fronts along the marina .
"fab food, great service, HUGE portions."
Just lovely - really can't fault it.
"This is a lovely, modern tapas bar and terraza in a great location, just across from the Neptune fountain (it's affiliated with the NH hotel) in central Madrid."
"The food is really excellent, and serves as a good introduction to the new (okay, not so new any more...) Spanish cuisine We weren't too hungry when we got there, but nevertheless dined well on a ""deconstructed"" (waiter's word, not mine) tortilla espannola to the squid ink rice (nicely salty and al dente), delicious little croquetas and wonderful octopus under a fluffy potato puree."
"The service is friendly, and the heat lamps in the terraza let you enjoy the view of the fountain and Paseo del Prado."
Absolutely PERFECT!
Good menu with fix price.
Very clean.
Good music.
Excellent service.
Have the tasting menu - 4 courses for 28 euro - plus 'amuses' and cheeseboard.
"Superb culinary experience, even if staff couldn't always explain what you were getting!"
"Went back a second time within the week, and received entirely different range of food."
Easily the best restaurant we visited.
"C&Z, Dundee."
"this is right on the beach and i always stop by and have a drink and snack its just rustic and lovely ,staff nice and friendly ."
"Whilst in Port de Soller we were ""tipped-off"" that the restaurant Es Raco was the best place to go to experience fresh fish, quality meat dishes and delicious desserts."
"Frequented by the locals, this family-run business did not disappoint and from starters to desserts was excellent."
The service made you feel completely at home and was cheerful and friendly.
"We had monkfish and roast lamb, both of which were cooked perfectly."
"For the dessert you must try the chocolate mousse, simply heaven!!"
"Outside seating overlooking the harbour and cosy, traditional interior."
"Thanks, Es Raco, we will be back!"
From the outside you could be mistaken into thinking ordinary type restaurant with average type food.
you could not be more wrong.
"Family run and could not be more helpful, every dish can be explained to you with recommendations to suit your palate."
If If you can only eat out one night because of the exchange rate just now this has to be the one.
Everything is freshly cooked and presentation is second to none.
We eat out a lot both on holiday and at home as would reckon this is amongst the best meals we have enjoyed .
Do not be put of by the position (within a row of shops and bars) easily driven past .
Recommend booking as a very popular restaurant.
I used this restaurant on 30th March 2009 and can highly recommend it.
My wife and I shared the Tasting Menu and whilst a little more expensive it was superb.
The restaurant gets a mention in the Michelin Guide but I fail to see why as yet it has not recieved a Star.
The food was exquisite and artfully presented.
I have eaten in 2 Star restaurants around the rest of Europe and can rate this one very highly.
The decor is unassuming with a little back-ground music.
It is in the heart of the city but quiet when inside.
"The range of wines is good and very reasonable as is the WaterMenu, very keenly priced compared to Uk restaurants."
Waiter service was by one girl with 3 covers that evening and her timing was perfect.
"Not only this but as it was her birthday they indulged us with a beautifully crafted birthday cake of sumptuous chocolate with a sugar constructed stork, a work of art."
We shall be back.
"Good seafood, very nice sea view."
Not Typical but pleasant.
Fattish food but tasty.
Beautiful standard restaurant downstairs.
once in a lifetime experience
"A very busy tapas restaurant, but it is worth the waiting time."
"""a real Italian Italian"" - sometimes too busy though (long waits)"
Good food but nothing special.
"Surroundings nice, loved the architecture and wanted to visit after reading it was designed by Cesar Manrique for Omar Sharif."
"Disappointed there was no live jazz, as indicated on their website which needs updating!"
Would visit again but not to eat there.
"Pros: top notch service (very kind + professional, also in French and English), great food, nice presentation."
"Cons: not ideally located, and maybe a little bit overpriced indeed."
"An 'ordinary' bacalao as main course is already around 25 EUR, if you take more exotic fish you can go well above 35 EUR/dish, however I found the level of sophistication (both in and outside your plate) is - just - not on par with the prices."
"And: beware of the ""salty touch"" of the bacalao."
Never in my life have I eaten a more salty dish.
"But it was very, very fresh."
"A warm, calm afternoon on the veranda with warming, earthy and salty sea bass ravioli, cous cous and soy sauce"
Cheap and good... What else ?
"Excelent food, service and atmosphere - highly recommend!"
"Good, tasty, and cheap."
"One of the cheapest meal you can find in Barcelona (6,90 Euro for a paella, 7,50 for a big jug of Sangria) but I have to say I expected better food."
Fideuà was very disappointing and only one of the three big Paellas we had was actually good (the other were tasting a little bit old... too dry).
No reservetion allowed so don't get there too late expecially if you are a big group
Great seafood
"Absolutely delicious pinchos but be careful cause since thay are so good (but not chaep at 1,80 Euro each) you might end up spending a fortune in here"
3.5.
Casual but friendly.
My seafood dish was nicely prepared with good sauce.
Very-very good modern concept tapas by Paco Roncero.
Very good wines by the glass as well.
"Try ""Manitas de cerdo con tallarines de sepia""."
No reservations.
"First in, first served."
"The restaurant itself is rather small, so you may want to arrive there early (before 9pm) if you do not want to wait."
"If you wish to eat a bit later, booking a table in advance might be a good idea."
The food is good (not excellent but  tasty) and the waiters are very attentive.
After many recommendations tried this restuarant on our last night.
Waited 20 minutes to order drinks then another 45 for any food to appear by which time we were half way down the port!
Waitress walked away while we were complaining and said the reason for the wait was because the prawns apparently take that length of time to cook and that length of wait time was common in Spain!
The manager lost all capability of speaking English when we wanted to complain which was funny as he had been chatting to others all night!
Terrible and overpriced.
"The sushi is good here, but also the noodles (try the yaki udon) and the rolls (california and fried ebi are my favourites!)"
"The staff is friendly, we go there very often, whenever we crave for sushi!"
Would recommend anyone to go there.
Good value for money too.
"We have just been on a 7 days trip in Andelusia, this was by far the best restaurant we went to."
They serve delicious food in an international cuisine standard.
We look forward coming back.
Discovered this delightful restaurant by chance while browseing in orange square.
Went there for dinner with seven other people and we all left very satisfied and vowing to come back again.
The owner and his wife were the perfect hosts.
Stopped in the nearby Hotel Picafort Park and soon found this place for our later evening and lunchtime option.
"Literally overlooking the sea , spent many an happy hour having a relaxing drink under the straw brollies."
Good Pizza from a stone oven and other food selection.
Its a jewel in the quieter end of Can Picafort.
We visit Moraira on a regular basis and have tried lots of restaurants and bars.
When we found this bar we were very impressed by the food (all fresh) the friendly atmosphere and the excellent selection of different wines from around the world.
"Each time we have visited, there has always been something different and new."
"The couple that own the tapas bar, (Justin & Becky) are very professional and know their wines, and their food."
"The general atmosphere is very comfortable with a lovely spanish feel to it, with background music to match the ambience."
"We will certainly go back when we are next in Moraira, and we already tell all our friends to give it a try."
This lovely tapas bar was recommended to us by our family.
It certainly lived up to expectation.
The tapas is excellent and I would certainly recommend the wine tasting!
The bar is run by a very friendly couple who go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
It is the perfect place to spend a leisurely evening.
We first found this place in October last year and really enjoyed the intimate ambience and great wine list.
We revisited last week and were pleased to find that they now have a full tapas menu with lots of delicious and different offerings than just your usual fried fare.
My wife and I tried their 3 tapas for 10€ which is available until 7.30 in the evening and we were so impressed we went back on our last night to celebrate my wife's birthday.
The couple who run Terravina are English however on the night we returned it was good to see that the place was busy and full of Spanish people.
A meal for 2 (about 3 tapas each inc bread and dessert) with a bottle of cava cost just under 50 euros and the quality and presentation were excellent.
Highly recommended.
Best noodles on the coast!
I have to agree with everyone else.
"This is not a sit down, eat your meal kind of place, however if you are content standing up having a few tapas (the way it is traditionally done anyhow) then you will not regret your choice."
We ate there twice in three days.
"The food, Pisco and ambiance were great and not to expensive fro Madrid."
"In May of 2009, my wife and I ate twice at the La Tagliatella Ristoranti and Pizzerie, 40 General Peron Ave, Madrid."
The service is excellent and nice atmosphere.
The portions are very large and many couples may want to split an entree.
The food was excellent.
The pizza was very large for an individual but delicious.
The restaurant is located near the Holiday Inn in Madrid in the business district.
A nice place to eat and relax.
"We had a superb evening at en Busca del Tiempo - a party of 13 looking for a special occasion, truly 'Madrd' meal which is the main event in our annual city break to a different Euopean city."
"This place was superb, great value menu at about 35 euros each, for 3 courses including wine, coffees and a glass fo cava to round it off."
The food just kept on coming!
"Sharing starters kept appearing - tasty and fresh salads, croquettes, pate, hams, bread, the main courses were equally delicious - steaks, venison, fish - fabulous flavouring and very generous portions."
"Desserts didn't disappoint, the wine flowed and the whole experience, in a beautiful dining room , windows wide open onto the balmy and busy street outside, with cheerful staff-- really hit the spot for us."
Would go back again in a heartbeat.
"Found El Tunnel by accident, not obvious from the road but once inside we knew we had found something worthwhile."
"Live flamenco/Spanish guitar music made the candle lit atmosphere even more enchanting, and once the food and wine arrived there was no doubt we had struck gold at this charming little restaurant."
"Whilst my Spanish is non existent, and the waiter had limited English, everything we wanted was provided in a friendly and helpful way - they even have an English translated menu."
"The food, steak for me and sea food for the wife, was out of this world."
Cooked exactly as ordered (medium rare steak) and melt in the mouth flavour - why is it so hard to get a good steak in England?
"We were sad to leave, we were there for over 2 hours just enjoying the music and atmosphere, but had to get the last bus back to the hotel."
If you are in Palma and want variety (e.g.
"sea food and steak) then this is the place - nowhere else came close on the remainder of our trip, and we will be back."
"Been coming here for 5 years, always busy, always freindly service and exceptional food."
Never had a bad meal.
Reasonable prices as well.
Cant fault it at all.
"Small quaint restaurant located on a street behind the Picasso museum, it captures all the Spanish ambiance you will ever need."
It also helps that the owner is the waiter.
Thanks to the reviews on Trip Advisor this is a place I would never find on my own and would selfishly keep to myself if I were local.
Our dining experience tested every aspect of their menu from appetizer to dessert.
"I highly recommend a visit and if Marcus suggests something to drink, comply, satisfaction guaranteed."
"We went here because we wanted to save a few bucks, and it was recommended in Lonely Planet."
We almost did a double-take when we saw the menu prices - they are quite low for Madrid.
"We had a decent meal, but the service was weird and surly - dishes arrived at odd times (mains before appetizers, and my partner was served about ten minutes before I got anything), and the servers practically throw the food onto the tables, then whip the empty plates away the second you´re done."
It´s really off-putting.
"If they could improve the service they might have something, but I can´t recommend it at this point."
I booked at Montiel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor.
It has been my favourite experience in Barcelona.
I rang on the day to book (which I don't advise) and they were kind enough to fit us in that night.
"Unfortunately I don't recall our waiters name but he was so helpful, spoke excellent english and made the most divine suggestions for meals and wines."
The restaurant is in a beautiful little lane-way off the tourist beats.
It is lit beautifully inside for a romantic dinner or intimate dinner with a group.
It's atmosphere is great and we loved everything about Montiel.
The meals were beyond what we hoped for.
"The cockles were the freshest I have ever tasted, the shrimp melted in your mouth and our mains were gorgeous... Then there's the dessert...."
Heaven!
(No waiting between courses) A wonderful place with amazing food.
My brother and I were visiting Spain last week and had dinner here based on a recommendation read on another website.
We were there on a Monday and were only ones in the restaurant.
"Marcus, one of the owners, was our waiter and spoke great english and he made recommendations along the way and each was excellent."
We started off with a cheese course which had three different types from different regions of Spain.
Next were some potatoes served with three different sauces and some shrimp with just the right amount of spices.
My main course was the suckling pig and it was excellent.
"We had two bottles of wine, two beers and a dessert wine and the total bill was $130 euros."
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Barcelona
"Fantastic hosts, great food ,great surroundings...what more can you ask ???"
"It is hidden away off the main strip but well worth a visit...Thanks Caroline , and James and Ediie who were playing live ..."
"This restaurant is amazing, simple as that."
"Everything about it is completely different from the other places around it, the elegant black/red decor, the friendly staff, and the amazing food!"
We went there for both dinner and lunch.
During daytime (1-4) they offer a set menu where you can choose three courses for 10 euros.
"The menu is fusian cooking, with Italian, Asian and Mediterranean influences, and I could write loads about it, but I won't bother, because it simply needs to be tested!"
"Overall one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, at pretty much half the price of many of the runners-up."
We visited this lovely special tapas bar a couple of years ago and having not been to Barcelona since I am itching to return.
It took some finding though!
Great cava served in what reminded me of Babycham glasses.
We had the full tpaas selection which included the most amazing anchovies drizzled with red wine vinegar and the olives were divine too.
Dessert was yum tiny cookies served with a little glass of liquer to dip them in.
Whilst the food and cava were lovely the atmosphere is probably whats makes this such a great place.
We luckily got a seat mid afternoon but it soon filled up.
You must go!
"Unfortunately, we visited Santa Ponsa at the beginning of the season and No."
"8 was only open Thurs, Fri & Sat - we could only make the Friday night."
"The decor is much different to most of the other eating places in this area - much better - as was the food, the service and the price."
"We eat out around twice a week, so have lots of experience and are notoriously critical!"
However we couldn't fault anything about this place - including the price which was very reasonable.
I would highly recommend it.
My first visit to No 8 was in September last year and I have just returned from another short trip.
I had 3 excellent meals - the fillet steak I had was the best steak I can remember having.
Nothing is too much trouble - the banofee pie or even strawnofee as I had one evening were defintely worth getting fat for.
I had a few other meals out during my stay but the consistency and quality of food at NO 8 is hard to beat.
"House Rose is superb and the staff are excellent, especially Heidi."
You absolutely should go.
My husband and two teenagers daughters enjoyed wonderful pastries and tea here.
The almond and egg tart and apple cake were standouts.
"The atmosphere is lovely, with candlelight and an old fashioned decor."
"very good experience, good cuisine, the sea food is fresh and amazing desserts !!"
i suggest you this lovely restaurant
Tucked away in a stone village in the rolling meadows north of Girona this restaurant is yet further proof that Catalunya is the eating Mecca of Europe.
Very well renovated rustic modern interior.
Slick service.
Very good food.
Starters were Sepia Tartar (with truffles) & stock poached squid.
Mains were slow cooked shoulder of lamb (cooked at a low temperature) & Smoked Tuna.
Chocolate tart for pud !
Delicious food.
If you want massive portions go somewhere that says 'cuina casolana'.
there is nothing in this small but attentive restaurant that will disappoint.
"from the gentle and multilingual service (thank you) to the focused expression of the beautifully composed dishes, and the wine pairings that are genuinely the handiwork of a genius."
my wife and i ate their a year ago and we still speak about it.
looking forward to our next visit.
we ate here with a large group.
we picked it mainly because many places were closed on a monday.
when we arrived we were the only ones there-worried us at first but as the evening went on they filled up.
the white sangria was the best we had- with lots of fruit.
most of us got steaks of some kind and they were all good.
they bring you some bread-a nice assortment but the only complaint I have was charging us 28 euros for that bread!
!-which we did not order.
"otherwise good food, even though our waitress spoke very little english she was still friendly."
Nice location although quite a walk.
Presentation of food is overdone and pretentious while it lacks taste and identity.
At an average of 100 euro pp a place for the (new) rich without a clue.
I go to Moraira and El Portet a few times throughout the year with family and we absolutely love this restaurant.
"The menu is fairly extensive with a set menu for 50 Euro, which is well worth it."
"If you are looking for a classy restaurant for a special occasion, or a treat this is definately the one!"
"The view is fantastic, the restaurant is beautiful, and sometimes the food can be great, however the last two times i have been i have been sorely disappointed, dont have the lobster."
"The service is effiicient, and slightly off hand, the atmosphere is great but thats because of the amazing view and lovely terraces."
Its worth going to for the views.
we had a large group for dinner here.
the waiter/manager was great despite being shorthanded and really made the evening more fun.
The food was one of the best meals we had during our trip.
every one raved about their meal.
I had the chicken roulade and my husband had the lamb with chocolate sauce.
all in all a great experience.
"This restaurant is located close to the cathedral in a pretty square, with tables inside and outside."
We wanted a vegetable paella which was on the menu but this turned out not to be available.
"The waiter was surly and rude, and it was all very expensive."
Altogether a very bad experience.
Don't eat here - there are plenty of other restaurants nearby.
"i was taken here by a local, and the food was exceptional, lots of great Tapas, and a simple restaurant full of local people at Lunchtime."
"great wine sold by the glass, and very good value for money."
This restaurant in the lovely Placa Real is to be avoided at all costs.
"The food is poor, the wait for the food is horrendous and then if you don't feel justified in paying the astronomical bill, the local police arrive to ensure you jolly well do!"
"Date: 15th May 2009 On a recent visit to Fuengirola, Spain we came across a little bar/restaurant in Fish Alley (calle moncoya) called The Yorkshire Rose."
We had been to Fish Alley the previous 3 nights and walked past this place as we tend not to eat english when we are on holiday.
"On our last night, we browsed at the menu outside and, looked inside and it looked very intimate and appealing."
"All the tables were dressed nicely with glasses and serviettes, more like a restaurant, than a bar."
"We decided to give it a try, and it turned out to be the nicest meal of our week in Spain."
"First of all the service was excellent, and we were very well looked after."
"They did a full menu aswell as a traditional set menu, with about 5 choices for each course."
"Everything was excellent, and very tasty food, they also do a mean jug of sangria to wash it down."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, and were never rushed in any way to finish our meals, which you get in a lot of places abroad."
"The place was quite busy, and we found out later that there was only 1 guy in the kitchen."
"It was hard to believe that 1 person could have got all the meals out in a timely manner, and to the standard which we experienced."
"All in all, I could not fault this place and would thoroughly recommend it for anyone going to this area."
We were just sorry we only went there on our last night.
"But we will definately go back, when we return to Fuengirola."
My friend had a chilli con carne that looked like someone had expectorated it the night before.
"Fortunately, although it was a boring tasting dish, it only looked that bad."
"I had swordfish, which was not 100 per cent fresh, but nearly and was ok."
The boiled potatoes had absolutely no taste and there was no butter sauce or any other sauce with the fish.
House wine so so.
It was really quite expensive for what was on offer.
Now that the previous owners have sold the restaurant to the old staff we were a little concerned as to whether the high standard of food and service would be maintained but our worries were unfounded.
The food and atmosphere was just as good as ever.
We will continue to look forward to many more pleasant evenings there.
Sushi that practically melts in your mouth and with that in mind you pay for what you get.
It's not the cheapest but it is great quality.
we did not have reservation but were seated right away.
service was great and food was delicious.
very good value for 3 course meal
Eat with the locals - big platters of sea food that the whole family can tuck into.
"This is a big family restaurant plonked right in the middle of San Pedro town, lots of people out for an evening stroll or for dinner or a drink, you get a sense that you are part of it all sitting watching, eating, drinking, muttering in broken Spanish - another two beers!"
"It is difficult to get a table here, the locals love it - fresh food that tastes good."
"We, a party of 8, went to this restaurant and had a great meal."
The steak which they say are rump but look and taste more like an english fillet are just delicious.
"They come in 200, 300 and 400gram sizes - one of our party did manage a 300 but 200 is really enough."
You cook the meat on a granite stone so the meat is just cooked to your perfection and is also good for you as no oil or fat is used in the cooking.
All steaks come with three sauces.
"There are also a lot of side dishes if you want like baked potato, chips etc."
They also serve chicken and pork which is cooked in the same way.
House wine was good as well.
Service is quick and they understand english.
We sat inside and outside and can recommend both.
If in Salobrena you must eat here at least once.
I booked here recently for 14 people.
"All of the follwing were outstanding - The location, the service, the ambience and most importantly the quality of the food."
I eat Indian food at least once a week all over the UK and I think I know what good Indian food tastes like and this is certainly up there with the best.
Highly recomended.
The Pato Laqueado is one of our first stops every time we visit Benidorm.
"The menu is vast, with something for everyone, and everything is affordable (or ridiculously cheap)."
My children always go for the chicken noodle soup and chicken chow mein; I loved the prawns with ginger & spring onion.
"The flambeed bananas are a great end to the meal, and my girls loved the bomboncitos (tiny ice-cream sweets)."
"There's a mixed clientele - British, German, French and Italian were there during our visits."
"My only gripe is that the restaurant permits smoking, and this has spoiled several meals in the past."
"I do wish they would ban it completely, but Spanish laws differ from ours according to the size of the premises."
"Don't expect luxury - it's not particularly fancy, but it's very clean and the food is absolutely fresh, comes in huge portions, and definitely won't break the bank."
"Staff are always smiling, efficient and friendly, and they don't rush you to finish your meal."
"At the end of the meal you are offered a complementary liqueur - Chinese flower, or apple: the bottle is left on the table so you can help yourself to more."
"It's highly popular, so I'd recommend reserving a table at peak times."
I can only enhance what reviewer bananafritter says.
"Definately the best chinese restaurant in Benidorm.Not fancy but excellent portions of fresh hot food.The menu of the day is available all day which is between 5 and 7 Euros including wine,beer or water."
4 of us visited last week and I always go there at least once on my Benidorm holiday and have recommended it to other people who have been impressed with the value for money.
"Our bill for 4 people last week was 28 euuros,you cant go wrong!"
!
Came across this completely by accident while walking round the picturesque village of Peratallada.
For such a small village this has plently of restaurants and hotels.
From the front you would never know but walk through to the rear there is a lovely garden shaded with trees and flowers.
"We ate at lunch time and had a fabulous meal, plently of choice on the menu and good service."
Even at the end of May the place was half full with mainly Spanish and French clientel.
I can imagine its packed in July / August but how anyone finds out about this place is a mystery.
A real find!
gnocchi and gorgonzola.
La Perla Nera has been a favourite place since 2004.
On all of our visits we go there to feast on what must be the world's best gnocchi!
Never have we found better.
This restaurant maintains the same staff year after year so it must be doing something right.
"It's easy to find and well located and if you're stuck for dinner, do yourself a favour and go there."
It's not spectacular to look at but all the food is first rate and not expensive.
Visited early May 09.
My partner & I walked the beach from our hotel Rui Olivia Beach into town one afternoon and was in need of a rest.
Waikiki was inviting and friendly.
We sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine and warmth together with great service and good food.
Top marks and would definately go back again.
"Great fun, very reasonable - I recommend the 17 euros tasting menu for two."
"The waiters are super friendly, and this is a fun vegetarian option."
Went to Bodecos and really loved it!
Such a nice break from the typical restaurants on the strip.
Without doubt the nicest resaturant we had been to in puerto del carmen.
The food was so nice and reasonably priced!
We got a free round of drinks in Buddys' after of meal and stayed there for the night!
Bodecos is really worth the walk to old town!
!
"Claire and i went to several restaurants in the old town area that the food was great, but after dining in bodeco's we were blown away with such exellant cuisine that they had to offer.The hospitality was very friendly bothin the restaurant and in buddys music bar."
"being a welshman i had to try the lamb and it WOW'ed me, all i can say is supurb!!!"
Claire had fish n chips and again it was nothing like anywere on earth that you would taste something so goood!!
"We went back on our last night of the holiday too, certainly highly recommended if you visit lanzarote."
"They also own Buddys music bar in the town and you are guaranteed a good night with a quality live band, and special guests play there too."
Really made our holiday as a couple and would love to back in the future
We were very fortunate to get a seat straight away without waiting as there is usually a substantial queue.
With or without a wait the food is well worth it.
"Fresh, original, tasty, and surprising."
Like every other restaurant we visited in Barcelona the food is quite expensive.
But in this case good value for money.
If you want tapas this is THE place to go.
"We complained that we where charged for another dish than we ordered, and the manager (who took the order) refused to accept that he had miss understood the order."
Despite the fact that his english was so bad that he needed a waiter to translate our complaint.
We where very dissappointed about being accused of lying about what we ordered.
"Also, the dishes are totally over priced, and varying quality."
"There are lot's of other good resurants in the area, so stay out of this one."
"We were a group of 10 ""mature"" ladies and were delighted with both the food and service."
"We chose a group menu which included a tapas styles selecton to start and then 4 choices of main and dessert, wine, water, bread etc at €53 incl VAT."
2 people wanted to change something - this was no problem.
I had been there before and would definitely go again.
"The restaurant was full of Spanish - many being business people, which to me says something about the place."
No it's not the cheapest in town but with such great harbour views and food it's worth it....!
We did not have a reservation and were but in a cramped room next to the kitchen.
"The food was OK but certainly not great, even the famous lamb and suckling pig."
"We were disappointed, especially for the price."
"Judging by the reviews here we weren't supposed to have a good time, but we did."
We limited ourselves to ordering just the suckling pig and the lamb.
"Both we very juicy and tasty, at the same time they weren't anything to die for, but the food was at a good level indeed."
"I would recommend coming here at least once, the atmosphere is great, we were given a tour of the kitchen at the roast area, where they had whole baby pigs roasted."
I sent in a review of the fabulous Hotel 1898 forgot to put the name of the bad restaurant we were recommended so thought I would post it here.
The name was Botafumeiro - Barcelona.
"Overpriced, poor attitude from staff, food average - not recommended."
See full review of trip Hotel 1898 Trip Advisor.
"We had the most wonderful food and local wine, the staff were charming and attentive without being intrusive."
Cannot recommend it enough.
This is a legendary restaurant and no one should mind being a tourist there.
The food is very good - I had excellent lamb - and the service is prompt but not rushed.
The trick is to have your hotel reserve a table on the bottom floor - also called the cave or the cellar.
This is the most atmospheric place to eat.
Walk-in tourists are eating up on the first floor.
Had a lovely dinner here one night Try the flambe strawberries they are delightful
My wife and I have been going to Cala d'Or on regular basis now for over a year and have walked and drove most of the area trying out bars and restaurants.
Apart from the well known restaurants in Cala d'Or we keep getting drawn back to Schooners Bar because of its quality feel and very friendly welcome from the owners Alan and Angela.
"We have found Schooners Bar to be an excellent place to go for light lunches as they have an excellent choice of sandwiches, light snacks and all the usuals but all are made freshly to order and all very good quality."
A must is the home made coleslaw and that comes from someone who will not eat it at home!
"This may not be the cheapest of bars (these can be found on the outskirts of Cala d'Or) but what it does do is offer a friendly face, excellent food and very good beer (Estrella Galicia)."
My wife also recommnds the various coffes available but I must admit I have never got past the beer!
What we also noted that although on an evening there is generally no food available there is Fondue's and Hog Roast available most nights.
Schooners can be difficult to find but is located on the townside road into the marina just up from the Post Office.
All in all a very good place to sit and unwind as the ambience is very relaxed with no loud music or TV's blaring.
"First visited this restaurant in August 2008 ; at this time, the garden setting, service and food were first class."
"An excellent experience, especially for the romantics !"
Visited again in May 2009.
Conclude something has changed.
The service was well below the previous high standard.
Whilst the quality of the food is generally very good the Menu selection is limited.
Typically Spanish cuisine.
The garden & views out to the Generalife / Alhambra create good ambience.
The 8.30pm opening time may deter some.
The staff were not ready when we arrived and the waitress had to be prompted to attend to our requests on numerous occasions.
Not sure if I would return due to the 'poor value for money ' factor but would still recommend others to visit as they may have a more positive experience.
The only place we ate in Girona as we were only there for a day-- but one of the best meals of a week in Spain.
The pizza with codfish and figs is unbelievable.
La Siesta is a family run Resturant situated directly on the Beach of Bolnuevo with views of the blue Meditranean with inside and outside seating Jose the owner and also the chef is hugley passonate about his food.a truly International menu with a wide and varied selection of locally grown produce and locally caught freash fish
"Not a great pizza house, slow service, food is below average."
Like said watch your bill.
Most of the year they are closed.
Maybe they should extend that?
we had a great evening at this restaurant earlier this month.
we had a table outdoor in the front.
everything we ordered was delicious.
service was good and ambiance was great.
"I think that in this restaurant on saturday evening May 23, 2009, a waiter noticed my PIN and stole my Credit Card."
"On sunday, May 24 he retired 250x4= 1000€ with it."
"This resturante never fails to delight us with it`s great food , for that special evening its a must,quality, quantity,and first class service."
Good basic food with friendly service.
It is on the main restaurant (and tourist) street in town (Franco) and is usually pretty crowded with tourists.
"Still, good quality for good value."
Be aware that smoking is permitted and it can get pretty cloudy in there
"In my opinion this is the only thai in barcelona,tiny restaurant that probably does as much in take away as in the actual restaurant.great value and well worth a visit.It was the best pad thai ive had outside of bangkok."
Stayed in one of the nearby apartments rented by one of the owners of the restaurant so we felt we needed to do one lunch there.
Worth it.
We did the price fixe menu and enjoyed the best of everything.
Wine was very reasonable and an excellent selection of quality local and imported wines.
First true gourmet experience with our two year old that went well since they had crayons and an accessible childrens play area.
"Did I mention location, absolutely beautiful and relaxing."
The restaurant is situated in a charming old house in Granollers.
Its recommended in the Michelin-guide (no stars) - thats why we stopped here for some lunch on our way from Reus Airport to Girona.
We would not recommend this restaurant.
The food was expensive and uninteresting.
"We hade gazpacho-soup - that was ok, but have tasted much better."
I had squid and my boyfriend had Paella with seafood.
All three are typical spanish dishes and are supposed to be safe choices.
"But allthough this is the most expensive restaurant in town, they didnt make me want to come."
Actually they made med regret the visit.
"The rest of our trip - (Girona, Costa Brava, Barcelona) we had excellent food!"
The food and wine at Ponchos is amazing.
The steak I had was like butter.
Super friendly staff.
I have lived in Spain for nearly 4 years and about two years ago my kids and I just happened to come accross this restaurant.....What A Find!
The food is brilliant and the prices are very reasonable.
The service is excellent and the staff are always friendly and polite.
"We have taken friends and family on many occasions and the most frequent comment from them is ""Best Steak I've Ever Had""."
"It is a well established restaurant so its advisable that you book and be prepared - this restaurant is that popular it closes for August (right at the height of tourist season, which is practically unheard of) If ever we have a celebration - this is the place that is most requested."
IT REALLY IS THAT GOOD!!
!
Excellent 3 course evening set menu with housr wine and coffee worked out at 22 Euros each.
Sevice good and meal excellent.
"We booked up this restaurant 8 weeks in advance to secure a day bed, for a 40th Birthday (group of girls)  The food was Lovely, At 12 Oclock it turns in to a club so u have to Vacate your day bed!!"
"staff were great very attentive, the music was Fab!"
This place is a must great atmosphere we stayed and danced untill 4am Also great for the day time sit outside on day bed's and look out on to the Beach Fab !!
My second visit & was well worth it!
Generous tapas portions and high quality.
We had trouble the first time because we went in at a crowded time.
"We speak very little Spanish, and the staff and other patrons seemed annoyed."
We had to retreat and when we tried again at a less crowded time (for lunch) we had no problems.
we went to the taberna on saturday night and we had to wait (standing) a long time.
"But the restaurant is in a nice square, and food was really excellent."
"The ""tabla de bacalao"" was surprisingly."
Would always recommend this restaurant and it's next door neighbour Es caliu if you like your food.
"Try the cod, you'll not regret it."
Get's very busy in the height of the season and would recommend making a reservation to avoid what might turn out to be a bit of a wait.
"Very friendly service from a family run, immaculate restaurant."
My wife and I had a wonderful meal last week at this tiny restaurant.
"Here is my sum-up:  Pros: *excellent quality, inventive food (cured duck and langoustine appetizer, black trumpet and onion soup, pigeon in a ginger broth, lemon and pistachio frozen dessert)  *reasonable prices on food and especially wine *gracious, knowledgeable service  Cons: none really except that you need to be telepathic in order to know that the degustacion menu can only be ordered in advance Cons:"
Great food great service!
Friendly environment.
We have a very nice evening there & waiters were very friendly and wanted to fulfill our requests.
We used to go to this restaurant a lot in 2006-2007 However last year (2008) we had a really bad experience.
"I took a client along and the food was really poor, they didn´t have any decent wine and we found the waitress to be quite cheeky."
Not wanting to judge by this this one experience I was willing to give it another try.
Unfortunately the second visit also produced the same results so we left it for a while.
We recently returned in April 2009 and found a completely revamped restaurant.
"Good selection of food, great taste and very nice environment."
We have since gone back three times and have never been disappointed.
This is a great little Mexican restaurant with a real authentic feel.
The waitress that we had a bad experience with has since left.
The only thing that continues to surprise me is the poor selection of wine and no nachos or Fajitas on the menu.
They need to change this to get full points from myself.
The good news is that they can do these dishes upon request even though they do not appear on the main menu.
I would highly recommend this restaurant for those looking for a romantic mexican night in Madrid.
Make sure you go on the nights with the live music.
The singer is really good and takes request.
"If you are able, make the walk uphill to the Garden Restaurant."
It is certainly worth the walk.
There are signs directing you toward the restaurant.
"At the top, you get that perfect picturesque view of the white village of Frigiliana in the hills."
"It is quiet and peaceful, with beautiful flowers and palm trees."
The food is also very good.
I also recommend the vino dulce - a local specialty.
"You can order lunch, or do as we did and just get some drinks and a few tapas to split."
"The service was friendly and not rushed, but attentive."
"Tapas were about 4-5 euro, raciones 7-8, entrees 10-12."
The sweet wine was about 3 euro.
"We took the bus from Nerja, which was very easy to do."
"There is not a lot to do in Frigiliana, but the ride over is worth it if only for the Garden Restaurant."
Cabs are also available.
This was our first trip to Frigiliana.
We visited the Garden Restaurant and were treated to fabulous food and wonderful service - plus glorious views.
We chose the menu del dia and were not disappointed.
The staff were attentive and the food was delicious.
We'd definitely recommend this place.
I feel compelled to write a review about Arzak after reading the few negatives comments from other advisors.
"Firstly, the upstairs is NOT the place where they shunt the tourists."
I was there at the beginning of May and knew that i was going upstairs because i am a smoker.
"That evening there was a cross section of diners including a few Amercicans but more importantly it was mainly spanish people, of which there was a table of 11/12 and YES they were all SPANISH!!!"
"Firstly, when we arrived we were treated with the utmost curtesy, our coats were taken and we shown to a table in the bar and drinks were ordered."
After about 15 mins we were shown to our table UPSTAIRS (oh...the shame...the place were lesser mortals go!!!)
.
"When we were seated and given menus, I informed the waitress that my husband is allergic to fish, this was not a problem, they just adjusted the amuse bouche to suit his palette."
What followed can only be described as a gastronomic delight.
"The waitress helped us select our choices from the a la carte menu, even sugesting combinations that work better together."
So in the end we settled on 2 split starters and 2 split mains.
This was all done in a very friendly and amiable way.
After we had ordered we were treated to an array of the finest amuse bouche that we have ever tasted.
"Exquisite little nibbles of pure delight, one after the other."
"Now, I am a seasoned smoker, but i didnt have time to even think about smoking, my taste buds were being indulged to such a degree, that the thought never even entered my head (smokers will understand this more!!!)."
"When the first starters arrived, I was surprised by the size of them, they were good sized portions, considering we were having 2 each."
The dishes were cooked to perfection and tasted divine.
They melted in the mouth and really did hit the spot.
The same can thus be said for the following courses.
"After we had finished the main meals, they bought me out a birthday cake, which was really nice of them, still not sure how they knew (husband I think)."
It was a chocolate torte of mouth watering yuminess.
We soon finished that off.
More inches on the waist!!!.
"Throughout the evening we saw the Chef working a few of the tables, doing their cheffy thing, he didnt come to our table, but we wernt offended, but you know that some people would be offended if they wernt acknowledged in this respect, you know the sort!!!"
"All in all, I would say that this is a top class restaurant with a real buzzy atmosphere."
I would thouroughly recommend this restaurant as a place thats at the top of its game.
If you want an evening of sheer indulgence then head out to San sebastion.......the city is a gastrononic delight with Arzak at its pinnacle.
"Total cost for the evening 380 Euros ""worth every single penny"""
"It's one couple and a one time experience, thus it may not be generalized as such."
"However, for everything to fail from food service to ambiance to wine service to food quality in a three star restaurant may be indicative of things deteriorating... We were so looking forward to this, our last evening in San Sebastian, at the Mecca of Spanish cuisine."
"Just to note, we had eaten on this and other trips at other reputable Spanish restaurants such as El Bulli, Akelare, Etxanobe, etc., and were not unfamiliar with standards, especially at a restaurant with three Michelin stars... First, we were welcomed and with some eye contact among staff, sent (exiled?)"
"upstairs, which seemed to be ""reserved"" for non-Spaniards... As I was trying to make pleasant conversation with the gentleman seating us, he hissed ""Sit, sit, sit, sit..."
"I will send someone who speaks English..."" OK, we sat."
Menus came and we opted to eat à la carte; we were not that hungry even though the menu recommended that we order the menu de degustation to get the feel of the Arzak cuisine.
"We were also a bit surprised that the menu de degustation was extremely uninformative and included dishes such as ""Meat"", really, that was it, as if saying, ""Leave it to us, we know what's good for you...""  The wine list took some time to come."
The sommelier took even longer and was very non-committal about discussing wines.
Everything was fine on the wine list as far as he was concerned; he did not ask what we were eating or anything to assess compatibility.
"So we asked for a Castillo Ygay 2000, tasted it and asked that it be decanted."
"Incidentally, the wine glasses and the water glasses were the same, I don't know what would have happened if we had ordered a Burgundy, for example..."
The food started to come but the wine stood there.
"After about 20 minutes, I reminded the waitressand she alerted the sommelier, who continued his non-chalance, ""Oh, I forgot to decant it..."" Then we noticed that one of the water glasses was chipped."
We asked the waitress to change it.
She brought a new glass but the old one remained on the table.
"About 15 minutes later, I had to ask her to remove it from the table."
"Finally, our main courses arrived."
I had ordered a rare pigeon.
Some of the fancy taste globules had melted and diffused on the plate.
The pigeon had been overcooked and taste like liver mush...
I gave a taste to my wife to show how bad it was and left about half uneaten.
"Now, I have to give Chef Arzak credit for his professionalism."
"While touring the tables, he noticed I had not eaten my pigeon."
He asked what was wrong and I told him it was overcooked.
He immediately sliced part of a breast and confirmed my assessment.
He asked that the plate be taken back to the kitchen.
I politely refused his kind offer for another properly cooked pigeon and we were not charged for this dish.
Arzak insisted on following up and showed up about 15 minutes later with the waitress who explained that the kitchen had misunderstood the order (my wife had ordered medium rare beef) and had cooked the pigeon miedum rare as well...
"There was nothing left for us but to pay the bill and leave, terribly disappointed..."
This is the best fishrestaurant in Calella.
The food and the service are excellent.
Great for midday lunches (3 courses for under €10)
Sagardi in Barrio Gotico was one of the single best experiences I had in Barcelona.
It's located in picturesque square in the old city that is pleasantly bustling all evening long.
The food is fantastic.
"It has many of the same tapas you'll find at other similar bars around the city, but these were fresher and changed more frequently."
"The wine was great (the red was better than the white, but both were more than worth drinking)."
"The outside area is nice in the warmer months, but the real value is in leaning against the bar, eating and listening to a half dozen languages around you (we counted 6 the second time we went)."
A great value.
Make sure it's one of the places you eas
"We had lunch here three times in a week, so we got to try a variety of dishes."
All were good.
I appreciated the vegetarian options; my husband enjoyed the meat.
Quality was very high.
"Prices were kind of high too, but not unreasonable."
Forn is right in the heart of the 'La Lonja' district of Palmas old town.
It's in a 3 storey building and we had a window seat right on the top floor.
"From the moment you arrive, you are made to feel special , though the service is attentive and relaxed,not at all stuffy."
"The food is excellent, for main course we ate the 5 hour lamb and the suckling pig.Both were fantastic."
"Although not really a pudding person, the barman in our hotel suggested we try the strawberries filled with Creme Brulee."
We did and they were perfect after a big meal.
The wine list is really comprehensive with a range of prices.
"The bill at Forn can run away with you , but after 3 nights of affordable Tapas, it was great to sit down to a really special and relaxed evening."
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who can manage the stairs!
"Situated in Morer Vermell in the bay of Polenca one mile from Alcudia old town near the hotels More and Panoramic, very peacefull with no traffic, just sit and look over the bay towards Polenca and the mountains, very good selection of food and drinks at reasonable prices."
We tried paelia (or how it's written) and lamb ribs.
"Ribs were ok, service great, but paelia.."
"I don't eat seafood, but half of my girlfriend's portion was mine, it was perfect!"
This restaurant was recommended to us because it is near the Palau de la Musica.
It should be recommended to everyone based on the food.
We ordered from the special menu where you get to choose an appetiser from a list of 6-8 items and an entree from a list of 6-8 items.
The seafood platter for 2 looked great too.
"The first time we went ,we had the French oysters, raw still in the half shell with a vinagrette .They were excellent, very fresh."
We also had the onion soup.
Delicious.
Our main courses were veal carpacchio and sole with spinach.
"The sole was so delicious, that I ordered it again when we returned to Barcelona."
There was an amazing white sauce on it and then it was put under the broiler to brown perfectly.
Chocolate mousse cake for dessert was also included in the price.
The second time we were there we had the onion soup again and vegetable risottto.
The risotto is the best that I have ever eaten.
"My husband had the duck, finished with a honey sauce."
he said it was the best duck dish that he had ever eaten.
For dessert we both had the profiterols (creampuffs) with catalan chocolate sauce.
"Service was a little slow the second time, but we arrived at 7pm and the waiters were not all there yet."
It was also a holiday and a table of 20 of Japanese tourists were there as well.
"They must have placed their orders prior, as they were served quite promptly."
The sangria is great too and our waiter even gave us some tips for making it at home.
We dressed up the first time we went and did not have reservations.
The second time we wore jeans and did make a reservation.
Walking into this restaurant feels like being welcomed into a family.
The owner will greet you and all the servers are friendly.
They will take the time to explain the dishes to you if you are interested.
"We tried their tasting appetizer - their delicious bread with hummus, babaganoush, and arabic salad...all were delicious and it as a large portion."
The briwat was also great and we had a chicken raisin cous cous that was also tasty.
"We liked it so much we wanted to eat there again the next day, but they are closed on Tuesdays."
Prices very reasonable.
Their homemade mint lemonade is very refreshing and a unique flavor that really hits the spot.
"The desserts at the other tables looked delicious, but we were stuffed from dinner!!"
"We split those three dishes for two people, and the end bill was about 35 euro, including our drinks."
"The restaurant itself is decorated with throws, rugs, lamps, and other things that give it a distinct atmosphere, like you've been transported to a different country."
"All in all, a great restaurant."
just ate there tonight with a few friends.
From the outside it doesn't look like anything special.
but this place is a hidden gem.
Go for the suckling pig.... it is amazing
"Everything, everything works in Akelarre!"
"Superb food, refined personable service, excellent wine list and knowledgable sommeliers who provide information without any condescension and a warm ambiance... And fantastic views of the sea from an overlooking hill... We were there for lunch on a gray day but the experience was thoroughly sunny!"
"Even during the reservations process, a rea; person answered the phone and courteously took the reservation with grace and appreciation (none of this credit card information and we'll let you know if we're going to let you in by e-mail type places)... A most relaxed attitude towards menu choices."
"None of this ""The whole table has to have the menu de degustation!"""
stuff.
There were two menus de degustation and one could have one and the other the other one and we could thus share and double our pleasure... Nooo problem...
"Wines, discussed, recommended and chosen."
"Then, about three hours of culinary pleasure..."
"Paced service with nothing overlooked, bread replenished without delay, wine glass not allowed to be empty, each dish explained proudly..."
"This is what makes a three star restaurant; professionalism, approachability and warmth."
Thanks to one and all...
"Great service in a friendly, bright, casual environment with well presented and good tasting vegetarian food."
"While I agree with several reviewers regarding the perfunctory service (especially on weekends), the food at Ginger is very good, generous, and a fantastic bargain."
We ate here several times and were never disappointed.
This restaurant has two faces and we experienced both.
The first night we ate there with a native of the city.
"It was Saturday night but we were not rushed, The food was perfect and delicious, and we could not believe how lucky we were to have found this restaurant."
"Good prices, good food, nice atmosphere."
"When we returned on Monday night, the restaurant was far from busy, but we were rushed at every turn."
"Barely half-way through our appetizers, the waitress asked if she could take them away!"
The Autumn salad that had been perfectly prepared for me on Saturday was an unimpressive concoction when my husband had it on Monday.
Chicken curry and papardelle with mushrooms were both outstanding on Saturday.
Veal entrecote on Monday was not prepared to order (requested medium - arrived very rare.
Requested to cook to medium - returned rare).
We began to believe that the Saturday chef was not working that night.
"When we requested a bit of time to finish our wine before ordering dessert, one after another waiter approached every few minutes to ask if we wanted to order now."
"Mind you, the restaurant was still more than half empty and it was no where near closing time."
Bottom line - your experience may depend upon whether you are treated as a tourist or a native - and which face of Janus you get to see.
"Great thai restaurant, warm welcome, good service and excellent value for your euro."
A must visit in Madrid.
An absolute gem.
Food excellent the Prawns with Tempura sauce are out of this world.
The staff are quick and efficient.
There is a selection of food that we are sure will suit everyone.
Not to be missed
Have been to this restaurant on many occasions over the last 5 years.
"We return year after year simply because the food and service are excellent, and also value for money."
You can always rely on Gemisant for top class food (especially the roast lamb) The personal greeting from the owner makes you feel very special and welcome.
This restaurant is busy throughout the year a sign that it serves good quality food at very good prices!
Whatever you choose off the menu you will not be disappointed.
Shall be booking when next in Pollensa
"It's a great spot, old and crusty, though spotlessly clean."
I was shocked to discover that the mark-up on wines was less than 50%.
"One of my favourite red wines from Castille, ""Dehesa de la Granja"", costs €13 to buy at Cortes Ingles, but was priced at just €18 in the wine bar."
"Won't hold my breath to see that happening in the UK or U.S. anytime soon :) The snacks were very good, though having Iberico hams and salamis priced by the kilo makes them look expensive."
"Nice cozy atmosphere, superb wines, expertly served."
I'm not totally sure of what I was eating but it was wonderful!
"We found El Bocaito by chance, having arrived in Madrid on a Monday when most restaurants are closed."
We did not eat in the restaurant; we enjoyed the bar in front.
It was the only tapas bar near our hotel that was open according to the Michelin Guide.
"On a street near Gran Via close to the Alcala intersection (but not off Gran Via), we found this fantastic place."
"Madrid was hot, hot, hot and not conducive to a large meal, particularly at Spanish meal hours (3 pm, 10 pm)..."
The staff extended an immediate welcome with a few complimentary plates.
"And later on, we found that the staff of Señors Miguel and Pepe and their colleagues make the place what it is."
Friendly yet professional; giving you intriguing tastes and recommending dishes and general pleasant chit chat.
"The tiny fried squid (chopitos), the fried anchovies, the fantastic steak that you finish cooking in a red hot sandstone plate... All accompanied with a good Verdejo or a Ribera del Duero... We decided that it was not worth going elsewhere in that hot weather and we were in Madrid essentially for the Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen museums, so we ate there all the time but once."
We tried to check and compare with another tapas bar noted in the Michelin Guide; what a mistake!
"As we walked into this other place at 8:50 pm, a sour-faced lady barked ""The kitchen does not open until 9 pm!"""
"Back to Bocaito, where they welcomed us with open arms."
Thanks to Señor Miguel and to all our friends at El Bocaito!
My husband and I had a whirlwind visit to Spain in just ten days.
"We visited Madrid, Granada, Alicante, Calpe, and Barcelona, and we easily felt that of all the great dining to be had in Spain, our most memorable and delicious meal was had at Patio de la Fuente."
"We both chose to have something from the menu del dia, as did the other couple we were dining with."
It was a tremendous amount of food for just 19.50 euros.
"I had the wonderful melon and forest fruits appetizer, followed by the chicken in bacon and date sauce."
"My dessert was a wonderful, fruity pavlova."
I would have happily returned to Patio de la Fuente another night if my husband and I had been in Calpe longer.
The service at Patio de la Fuente is just wonderful.
"The British couple who manage the place are lovely people, and they make you feel very welcome and cared for."
"The decor is very nice, too, and the whole atmosphere is quite cozy."
"The place was full of life when we went---very busy, and the other clients seemed to be enjoying themselves as much as we were."
Don't miss out on this gem of a place!
It is well worth a side trip to Calpe just for the pleasure of dining at this restaurant.
"This is an absolute gem of a Barcelona cafe, serving food and drink all day in the most charming art nouveau surroundings where you can rub shoulders with the locals reading the complimentary newspapers."
"The staff are unfailingly polite , even when the tourists have had a few too many of the wonderful Martinez brandy (7 euros a shot) and are getting rowdy..."
"Delicious breakfast food, fabulous fresh orange juice squeezed before your eyes, and later a good range of traditional tapas and simple dishes."
Proper alcoholic sangria served indoors or out.
Favourite - a huge glass of the Cava sangria.
We have been to Tipico Canario frequently in the past two years we have been to Lanzarote.
"The food is top class, we have never had anything that wasn't A+, the meat is always cooked to perfection, the fish also cooked to a high standard."
"the portion sizes are plentiful , staff more than helpful and entertaining!"
"Have rcommended this place to friends who also think the same, best restaurant in Playa Blanca, well worth a visit."
A++++++++++++ roll on July for our next visits.
We have eaten at the Haveli in Nerja on numerous occasions.
Every time we go on holiday we make a point of visiting there at least once if not more.
Food and service are excellent....highly recommended.
Last year they opened a beachside bar/restaurant at Burriana too where they sold indian tapas and a lovely cool drink made from crushed melon and ice...perfect for a hot sunny day.
Will be visiting again when we return in July .
"Eaten here on several occasions, all having been nothing less than excellent."
"As an avid fan of indian food, the menu is second to non, the servise is great and the food superb."
Can´t say anything more.
"Ok, if you want somewhere that´s close to Las Ramblas and relatively expensive with average food then you´ll want to go here..."
"Apparently, it has a reputation..."
I suspect this is a historical reputation that it has been trading on for the last few years.
The food and service were unimpressive and it wasn´t inexpensive so why would anyone feel the need to return here??
Who knows...
I know we won´t.
There is far better food (and value) to be had in Barcelona...
Great view.
The food was good but certainly not great.
I had the sole on a bed of potatoes and it was good.
We shared an appetizer of fried artichokes that was just average.
Each of our desserts was very good and we had a great bottle of wine.
"Dinner for 3, including a bottle of wine and dessert was $187 euros."
"Really nice place to go, characteristic for the food and for the furniture."
"The Paella was great, tasty and succulent."
"Sangria is good, a little bit heavy for women’s palate."
Really delightful the bread shape like a snail (the name of the restaurant).
"Incredibly busy, we left our name and were told to come back in 1 hour which worked out OK. Great rustic surroundings, good ambiance, food OK, reasonable value well worth a visit."
My mother was recommended this restaurant fro somebody who was from Barcelona.
"It was easy to find, just a road off la ramblas."
Spotted it instantly as had read a review about the chickens hanging in the window!
Once you go inside you are wisked through the steaming hot kitchen and then you are lead around the windy restaurant and at a table before you know it and the air con hits you!
its quite an experience!
"I had the half roast chicken as it is a speciality and it was beautiful, My partner had steak and thoroughly enjoyed it."
We went to a Jazz bar afterwards which was just down the turning on the right before the restaurant and that was fab!
"this has got to be one of the hidden gems in marbella, i have been going now on a regular basis for the last 5 years and have had a great time and good value food and wine."
Favourites of mine include the blackpudding with rice and the grilled cheese/bacon/tomato.
house wines are good value and good quality.
visit at fiesta time and try free samples of local sherry to wash down the tapas.
if you try speaking Spanish the waiters respond and in time they get to know the tapas you eat and bring them before being asked.
"do not visit Marbella without trying this local version of the basque style of tapas you will not be disappointed, if you are you should have stayed in torremolinos."
"We have recently come back from a weeks All inclusive holiday in Arenal Castell, the food in the hotel we stayed in was quite bad so we ate out rather than use the hotel."
"We ate every day at the El Pirata Restaurant which is situated in Coves Noves just on the outskirts of Arenal Castell, the Restaurant is a family run place, Tony and his wife were lovely, the food was excellent, always fresh, and reasonably priced, Tony and his wife went out of their way to make us feel welcome, which encouraged us to return each afternoon and each evening."
"The toasted sandwiches were so fresh and presented well on the plate, we ate the marinated chicken as well as the steak, which was excellent."
"The Pirata Restaurant was the best place to eat and drink in Arenal Castell, the prices were very competative."
"Located just a block from the L4 Joanic metro station, La flor de gracia was our best restaurant find in Barcelona."
"It was suprisingly uncrowded on two weekend nights, which allowed for excellent service (the waiter, who owns the restaurant with his family, explained the full menu to us in English) and quiet meals."
"The food was superb, and the prices were very low by Barcelona standards."
"We tried several of the fish dishes, all of which were great, and I greedily helped myself to the foie gras starter both nights."
"Very good mexican food, not too much to chose though."
It is allowed to smoke inside which I don't like at all.
The place is very nice and they have a very good service although I don't know how they organize it.
There were available tables but still they made us wait until all tables were emptied to arrange us a table.
Just returned from Nerja.
The trip to 34 was one of the highlights.Food was excellent.
top class.
Dining room gorgeous & service was perfect.
V good value set menu for 25 euro.
"We found several bugs mix with the food, fried with the rest of the food!!!!!!."
"Moreover, instead of apologizing and taking those dishes out of the bill, they told us that it was normal and force us to pay for them."
"good pizza in spain, but their speciality is pan pizza,,,,, try it its really good"
"Bad service, like my other experiences in others chinchón's restaurants."
But nice view
it really is the best at burriana!
"everything fresh, very kind owner, nice place to sit."
"As tourists, it can sometimes be hard to find a great place to dine where the locals do instead of being surrounded by tourists."
"Bazaar is a bit off the beaten track in the Chueca area, but it is worth the short walk away from the touristy areas for a great experience."
"The food is good, the place is hopping, and it is affordable with entrees around 12 euro."
We had a fantastic meal and would return.
My husband & I have been going for short breaks just outside Torremolinos twice a year for the past six years.
"Sometimes we go alone, sometimes we take grown up kids and sometimes we are with friends."
We all love this restaurant and visit at least once per trip - usually on route up the steps to the town centre for shopping.
Fish is always fresh and the spanish sherry is really good.
Excellent value for money especially since the £ is devalued against the euro.
If you want the REAL taste of Spain and a good atmosphere - not to be missed!
Visited this italian retaurant with Kitsch interior with puppets last night.
"Pizza had chinese mushrooms in it, These an acquired taste as rather strong and should not have been included."
Too much crust.
I left the crust and the chinese mush.
"I could not trace the taste of gorgonzola promised on this ""Alfio"" pizza."
"House red was good though, 2005 Castile."
No chip and pin machine so left wondering what was happening with my credit card.
"Plate swept away and no dessert or coffee offtered, had to chase for the bill, service cool/bordering on the unfriendly."
We ate here for dinner one evening since we had a taste for Italian.
The food was great and quickly served.
The garlic bread to begin with was delicious and the pasta was delicious and served in huge portions.
"Food was brought quickly, but then the server did not check back on us again for the duration of the meal."
It was like a game trying to catch his attention when we were ready for the bill.
"After dinner, they offered amaretto (free)."
"Saw someone else get limoncello, but didn't want to impose and ask for it so we were happy with the amaretto."
I'd recommend it if you are looking for good food as long as you are not in a rush.
We are back a week or so but still have good memories of Nerja and the Sevillano.
"Our first evening we went in and both ordered steaks, mine a fillet and wifes a Tournedo Rossini."
She wanted it medium to well done but it came out rare.
We swapped and it was delicious and she enjoyed mine.
She complained to the manager and after suitable apologies we were served a complimentary drink.
"Next time we came we were recognised, welcomed and made to feel special."
Both the manager and waiter fussed over us and it felt good.
I had rabbit and my wife had sole in orange sauce.
Both were excellent with good starters and deserts.
It was good value for money and the ambience was relaxed and friendly.
"This restaurant did the unthinkable, it served us up processed chicken."
The wine was so so and the chips were dry out of a packet.
I realised why they had run out of jacket potatoes.
If you like grilled meat this is the place to be in Calella.
The actual barbecue is kinda legendary ;-) A tribute to F.C.
Barcelona.
Between 13.00 and 16.00 they have a excellent midday lunch wich can't be beaten.
"It includes bread, starter, first course, second course, dessert and drink"
"We began to tire of tapas (the pace, the simplicity, etc.)"
so we decided to have sit-down meal in the restaurant upstairs at Casa Pepe.
"After walking through a huge wine storage area, we were seated in a charming room of 10 or so tables (there were multiple rooms.)"
"Server was a little slow to get to us (though I could see he was busy with others), but eventually the level of attentiveness matched the refined setting."
The food was all very good.
The salads were fresh and inventive.
The meats (my date had lamb and I had duck confit) were very good.
Throughly cooked (but appropriately so.)
"I don't recall the dessert, so it must not have been that memorable."
The wine list was quite extensive (56 pages!)
and the grape varieties were identified (which was a big help if you are not all that familar with Spanish wines.)
"They forgot to charge me for our bottle of wine, but I dutifully noted the oversight."
"Not an amazing experience, but certainly a worthly alternative to the more casual annd frenetic tapas meals that dominated our trip."
"great atmpspehere, food nothing special, note the very ""funny"" owner Oliver burri, tootally very stressed, he is carecteristic for the restaurant"
I just had lunch there today and it was delicious and cozy.
Not expensive and not the typical italian: I had burratta salad (mouth watering) and gorgonzola & funghi risotto (spectacular).
The place to go!
!
"We have eaten there 3 evening in a row, because we couldn't get enough of the great atmosphere there."
The place is huge (aprox.
"500 persons, so one might consider it too crowded), but still the service is excellent."
The waiters jump and dance between the tables while serving the best and fresh sea-food.
"People come from all over the world, in smaller or larger groups, and they sing and laugh while enjoying the dinner and the view of Port Olympic."
"The prices are a little bit high, but anyway, it's Barcelona, so one cannot expect small prices."
It's worth every penny.
Last summer we spent so much time in the Bay bar we knew most of the staff by name!
"It is everything you would expect from a cool Ibiza bar...yet a million miles from the west end (metaphorically not geographically) The best in Chillout tunes, great views over the harbour, AMAZING cocktails (I recommend the Caprioska con Fresa), Moroccan style lounge beds, The perfect antidote for a hangover...and the food's really nice too...I will definitely be back!"
Really loved our meal at Piscolabis!
Great tapas....everything was very fresh.
"Enjoyed asparagus, squid, potato omelet and I especially liked the small sandwiches."
A super place to have dinner if you're staying next door at the Hilton.
We spent 5 days in Barcelona and had 3 meals here.
The service is excellent.
The staff is very friendly.
The food is great.
"It's reasonably priced, more so than the general explanation shows."
Nice atmosphere.
Overall wonderful experience.
Piscolabis has two tapas bars.
They are not restaurants for having regular meals but for eating various tapas which are small portions of Spanish dishes.
The food was OK but unremarkable and very expensive considering the tiny portions.
Watch the waiters carefully and be very clear how many portions you want because if you aren´t you may end up with more portions of a dish than you want..and for sure you will be charged.
We were not impressed by it all when we were handed a check which was about 20 euros more than we had expected.
I wonder if they treat locals the same or is it just the vulnerable tourist who suffers.I left very disappointed
Had dinner here after reading review on Trip Advisor.
Well worth it we will go back again.
The staff were thrilled to here they were mentioned on the internet.
Yesterday my wife and I had dinner in Santiago-Restaurante.
"She had fish, I had some beef."
"The food tasted well, but during night we got stomach ache and diarrhea."
NEVER AGAIN !!
!
"Excellent, just loved it."
Though must agree with review about bad taste.
I assumed that it had been open much longer than the recent american presidents election.
But its a nice little bar worth the short walk from Las Ramblas.
I'd recommend it for sure.
Had the pleasure of having breakfast here on three occasions and dinner once.
"One of everything ie sausage,egg, bacon, tomato, beans, mushrooms and toast, 3.35."
Two of the above 4.35 and three 5.35.
"Had the two first time, a bit too much for us."
"Steak pie, chips and veg 5.75, again good portions."
"It`s only 1.90 a pint, but never spent much drinking time here, also 241 between 7 & 8pm."
Three course meals available for 4.50.
"Toliets are spotless, which we think leaves an excellent impression on how the premises are run."
"Well done George and Jackie, wish you contiuned success."
"excellent authentic tapas, efficient friendly service and great value."
a great place to the east of the old town if you are visiting the park or the picasso museum.
highly recommended and popular with locals.
This gem of a restaurant looks out of the way but is actually very accessible from the environs of Bilbao and San Sebastian... We had seen Etxebarri on the Bourdain and Jose Andres shows and made a point of going there.
It is in an idyllic location in the mountains... Etxebarri is an ex-forester who has created a fantastic grill and cooks everything on charcoal ( a fresh batch for every plate) made in a kiln on site.
"A young chef, Lennox, came out and helped us with menu choices as well as wine recommendations (we had a garage Rioja; Raibarri)."
"The menu prices may look daunting but Lennix explained that we could have everything in half portions and even share that, which we did..."
"The smoked butter, the Palomas shrimp, the calamari and the rib steak were outstanding..."
Highly recommended... May not have a Michelin star (which it definitely deserves) but it was an unforgettable experience!
(Note; dinner only on weekends...)
"not a patch on zaffarino, the food portions are too large and the food style is more suited to the eighties"
"Lovely restaurant, I had the steak as a maincourse and it was really tasty!"
The service was good and I would definately return when i'm next in Marbella.
"Went to eat in Zoi Zoi on May 19th 2009 in a party of 8 diners, 4 adults and 4 children."
I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.
"The food was simply superb, so much so that although we flew home the next day, the other 2 adults went to Zoi Zoi again the following night !"
I have not posted a review on Trip Advisor before but felt that I had to after eating in Zoi Zoi.
"Quiet simply the freshness, quality and depth of the flavour of the food was something that we had'nt had in a long time, and we visit Marbella every summer, and like our food."
For the record I had the prawn & chicken skewers with cous cous and I'm still dreaming about a return to the restaurant.
"Also my main course was 18-18.50 approx which I considered to be excellent value for the quality of the food, which I must add was in plentiful supply."
Azáfran has the most exciting menu I have seen in a long time.
The food is traditional Andalucian cuisine with a modern twist.
The pork medallions in dark chocolate sauce are to die for.
I did not try the strawberry gazpacho but I will the next time.
The salmorejo was perfectly chilled and complemented with fried eggplant sticks.
"And with Spain's wine friendly policy (no more than 2-3 euros per glass), it is easy to create a pairing menu."
"Also, the service was very good."
"Traveling by myself, I was prepared for difficulties in seating."
"Instead, I was given a good table with a nice view of the Alhambra, then moved (at my request) to a window seat with an even better view when that became available."
The waiter was knowledgeable about the wines and was able to make appropriate suggestions.
"I left the restaurant crawling on my belly because I was so full, but I would go back anytime."
We had heard lots of good things about this restaurant and was really looking forward to it.
We got a flyer from one of the guys touting and he gave us 10% off the bill.
"The place itself is beautiful, very nice surroundings, the staff are very friendly, however the food was distinctly average."
"We'd asked for steaks cooked medium/rare and they came verging on well done, the salad that was ordered instead of fries was small and looked a bit tired!"
We were disappointed after hearing so many good things about this place but I don't think we'd go back again.
"We had to wait about 45 minutes both times we ate here, but it was well worth it."
"The service was excellent, with friendly waiters who spoke English."
Every dish we had was fantastic.
The thinly sliced fried artichokes were heavenly!
Prices were very fair.
This place deserves its popularity.
"Good for a sandwich and a quick bite but with so many better options close by, I will not eat there again."
My guideman recommend that restaurant / bar .
I ate a lot of Tapas at the bar part of Ciudad Condal .
I drank Sangaria with tapas in the afternoon .
I think you must go to there in the afternoon so you will start to see other focus with your eyes in the afternoon for Barcelona :) The athmosphere is great !
Waiters were working like a bee !
Bon apetit !
"a risotto verde, the best croquttes we tasted in Spain, exquisite fried artichokes, memorable blend of haje and monkfish, superb service, great value for wine list"
One of the top three restaurants in Ronda is the 15-table Albacara restaurant at Hotel Monteliro.
My wife and I have owned a home in the old quarter of Ronda for ten years.
She has managed top restaurants in Seattle and San Francisco.
This is the 1st restaurant that we take our house guests in Ronda.
"If you are a foodie, you will not be disappointed."
"The food, wine and service is as good or better as Michelin-rated Tragabuches in Ronda."
"We love the suckling pig, ox tail and wild game they serve."
"Alternatively, you can order all the appetizers, which are small tapas plates, using the fresh, local, sustainable foods of Andalusia."
"Off-menu, we recommend the pork cheeks as well as their tasting menu."
Prices are reasonable.
Average food and wine tab is about 20-25 euros per person.
"If you go, reserve a table on the porch terrace."
You get a spectacular view of the Ronda gorge and valley below.
We had one of our best meals at this restaurant.
"Ambiance, service, food and price were al outstanding."
"If you are around the Picos De Europa National Park or taveling along the northern coast of Spain and are near Arriondas, do try this excellent restaurant run by a husband (chef) and wife (manager, sommelier, etc.)"
team.
It was just before a three day weekend and we were alone for lunch.
"We were served a superb menu de degustation that was flavorful, balanced and not excessive."
The service was elegant and informative.
The wine list was excellent and well priced.
Highly recommended.
"It really kills me when, in the US, you ask the waiter for a wine recommendation and they say ""oh, I don't drink wine""."
No such problem at La Orza!
"Not being overly familiar with Spanish wines, I asked for a recommendation to pair with my late night supper of gazpacho and dessert."
"In both cases, the waiter was able to come up with a good pairing and, on top of that, could explain the wine and its qualities and how it compared to others."
"Dinner was pretty good too, the gazpacho perfectly chilled."
"The Pedro Ximenez vino oloroso (sherry) made a perfect foil to the cold almond soup (more of a pudding, really)."
"Although I was the only one seated on the terrace (the other diners being inside), I never had to wait long for service."
"I don't know how their main courses are, but definitely a recommended gastronomic stop in Toledo."
This is without doubt the best resteraunt in puerto rico if not gran canaria.
We have known Rachid and Liza for a number of years and could not believe it when they opened there own resteraunt.
There attention to detail is excellent and the food is out of this world.
"It may be a little bit more expensive than some of the other resteraunts, but we firmly believe that you get what you pay for."
We look forward to visiting El Brasero very soon for a lovely sirloin cooked to perfection.
El Brasero serves great food.
"It is in the Europa Centre on the top floor, and as with all 'centres' you don’t particularly get much natural character with the surroundings, but here Liz and Rachid have fitted the restaurant out very nicely and have made the effort with good quality glasses, linen, cutlery etc as well as, more importantly, the food being extremely nice."
For me it’s the nicest food in the Europa Centre.
"It may well be more expensive too, but you get what you pay for, and that said you'll still find the costs reasonable."
"You may not eat there every day, but once you've tried it you'll make sure that you have at least one more visit within your holiday, so don’t leave it until your last evening otherwise you'll rue that fact you didn’t go sooner in your holiday."
"There is a good selection of meat and fish dishes, as well as pasta and pizza - all the usual suspects really, but the difference is that the choice is more varied and all the veg is fresh (not something you'll find in many places whilst holidaying in Gran Canaria!"
"), and you can also place orders for such delights suckling pig and rabbit so long as you give them a days notice."
"Whilst being a haven for couples looking for a good meal in a good restaurant, Rachid the restaurant owner is always a favourite with kids as he makes sure they feel 'wanted' whilst keeping them in-line, unlike some other places that will remain nameless, meanwhile the adults will get a giggle as he keeps his staff in check with the most odd but amusing comments."
"This is the place where you are more likely to find more unusual starters and the desserts are a must too if you have any room left over for one, many of which are homemade as opposed to the bought in varieties that are aplenty elsewhere."
If you’re on a tight budget then do yourself a favour and make sure that you have one treat of the holiday and get yourself along to El Brasero.
"If you enjoy good food and always choose the best place to eat out, then make sure you go along on your first evening - you may surprise yourself how many times you will end up eating in the same place, night after night!"
"SMS Delicies is a somewhat spatially challenged establishment that manages, again and again, to surprise with the quality of its cuisine - assuredly delivered on one of the best value lunch menus in this part of Barcelona."
"Competition is hot in the centre of Gracia but SMS Delicies eschews the regular 'Menu del Dia' fodder to favour dishes that emphasise simple quality ingredients and a fresh, modern and light style of cooking."
The interior is a little cramped when very busy but the staff have always been efficient and friendly.
Its corner location and glass frontage illuminate the interior warmly during the day and the place has a bright breezy feel.
"Alas, common among Spanish restaurants, the air-con is not up the challenge when there are many smokers present."
"The kitchen appears tiny but in 6 or 7 visits, regardless of how busy they are, they've not missed a beat."
"On my last visit I had a rich creamy 'Penne with Ceps', followed by a light and tasty 'Grilled Strips of Chicken with Caramelised Red Onion'."
Desert was a slice of cheese-cake with fresh berries.
This was accompanied by good quality fresh bread and a passable glass of house white.
All for under €9 - A 'Menu Del Dia' does not have to be bland and stodgy.
"Once again, I left in a good mood and keep will going back."
This place specialises in joints of milk fed lamb cooked near the flames of a wood burning oven.
Great place if you like meat.
Basic but memorable surroundings and popular with locals.
Certainly worth a visit.
I rate this food somewhere from poor to average.
Service is capable.
They serve Andalusian prepared meats and stews.
It is popular with tourist tours.
Nothing stood out for me or my family.
"They serve the equivalent of comfort, diner-style food."
"If that's your thing, go for it."
Family friendly.
This restaurant would not make my top 10 list of restaurants in Ronda.
service was good and the food was even better!
make sure to be hungry so that you can try all the varieties the restaurant offers
"Extremely pleasant service and setting, with great food and good value as well... What more can you ask for?"
!
Great food.
Small Italian restaurant with a fantastic food.
"We recommend pizza "" Il Pizzaiolo"" , spanish jam, artichoke, blue cheese."
"This place was amazing, food atmosphere, people, everything was fantastic, a must in barcelona."
"I ate so many great things, I couldnt even start to tell you what they were."
They wer all great.
I wanted to go again but time did not permit.
"Great prices also, Go and enjoy,"
We had read good things about this tapas restaurant at Trip Advisor and also in other guidebooks.
The staff at our hotel suggested it as well.
"Although we managed to get in after a twenty minute wait one evening, two subsequent attempts failed."
This place is hopelessly crowded with both tourists and locals.
"The night that we did have the opportunity to eat there, we thought that the food was very good."
"Quite honestly, though, we had equally good tapas, nicer house wine, and much friendlier service at other places we tried during our week stay."
This tapas bar/cafe offers a range of tapas elegantly presented for self-service.
Customers pay per stick (per piece) counted by the waiter when settling the bill.
"The system is very effective and the bar has a large turnover of customers, so it is a very busy place."
It is usually crowded but customers usually wait only few minutes to get a chair.
"The chef(s) constantly produce new tapas variants, most of which do not have a name, customers simply pick what they find appealing (no knowledge of castillan/catalan needed)."
"Food is generally good or excellent, and moderatly priced (around 7 euros for a meal)."
"Seating comfort is limited, this is fast food."
We stumbled into this place by accident and was totally surprised about the high quality.
Excellent location on the square in front of the cathedral.
We went here because the restaurant is recommended in the Michelinguide 2009 for Spain (no stars) and it has several good reviews on Tripadvisor.
It was a huge disappointment.
"We had the seafoodmenu with: *Steamed mussels (too heavy cooked - and no whitewine, no garlic."
"Very boring dish) *Salad and anchovies (love anchovies, but the sauce was not matching - made it a bad experience) *Salted cod (the best dish on the menu - bacalao-like."
mmm...) *Shell-fishs soup (shellfishsoup without shellfish..not good) *Filet of black bream with vegetables (overcooked fish.
It was dry) *Dessert trolley (lots of cakes and desserts of your own choice - had a lovely chocolatemousse.
At last a good course) The staff was friendly.
But the atmosphere was not.
Too much light.
"Felt like sitting on a cafe at a trainstation, hospital, at work etc."
Price-qualitywise it was low quality and high prices.
We payd around 40 euros per person.
You should rather spend your money in these two restaurants: 1)Pizetta and 2)Aiguaclara Restaurant at the Hotel Aiguaclara.
Following some reviews from tripadvisor we decided to visit this restaurant while we were on the Costa Brava.
The food was superb.
Our only regret was that we couldn't go back a second time.
"Although it was quite busy the owner was attentive, the service was good, and as I said, the food excellent."
"We had langoustines, cod, a very interesting cold rice dish, (which he had served originally as an amuse bouche), an asparagus dish and the local catalan ""meat and potatoes"" pie."
We were so satisfied that we couldn't fit in dessert although the dessert cart looked fabulous!
The only caveat is that it is hard to find.
"There's a sign for the restaurant on the main road, but when you go up the road you end up in a courtyard area with a sign to ""Hotel Rosa"", but no mention that the restaurant actually is in there."
It took us quite a while to locate it.
It is in a small lane off the cathedral courtyard (Which is a different courtyard from the place you end up in if you come in from the main road).
"Anyway, the moral of the story is persevere it is worth it."
The hotel reception said that we should go here for a nice cheap dinner but they warned us that there would be a queue.
"We took our time getting there (detour to a bar) and arrived at la fonda about 20:00 - no queue, but the place was almost full."
"We went in, were seated promptly (upstairs) and had a really nice, lengthy dinner."
"The food was delicious, the service was great by my standards (maybe a bit slow by american standards), and the bill was almost a joke (I admit...I live in NYC) at roughly 50 euros for a couple of courses, wine, even a half bottle of cava."
But I definitely understand the resentment around queues...there are places in NYC I refuse to try because of them and I know I will be completely underwhelmed by them.
My wife and I stumbled across La Fonda and read the menu outside and decided to give it a go as it seemed to be busy.
It was about 8pm on a tuesday we were sent upstairs and shown to a very nice table overlooking the ground floor .
When looking at the menu it does strike you at how cheap it is and at looking at the food coming out it seemed to be very good value .
We both ended up having 3 courses each and having the most expensive bottle of red wine on the menu ( 13euros! )
"which is a first for me, a coffee at the end and all for 53euros ."
"The food was very good ,the wine nice but as mentioned in previous reviews the staff could have been a tad happier but to be honest who cares when your getting this value for money ."
Also people still coming in and queuing at 10-30 pm when we were leaving.
You will find no better quality/price ratio in Barcelona
The food at Estilo Campo is great.
I had the most tender pork loin I've ever had there...I wiould definitely go back.
We had a really tasty meal at La Paella.
"We ordered the Paella de la Casa - a combination of shrimp, clams, cuttlefish and chicken."
The flavor was subtle and delicious.
"We were able to get a reservation from our hotel, which was fortunate for us as the place filled up very quickly."
"With only 3 waiters working (which I think is normal), it is no surprise that service is brisk."
But our waiter was kind and efficient and we never lacked for anything.
We would go back.
The prices were reasonable too.
We were recommended this restaurant by someone who lived in Barcelona.
It was fab!
We had a wonderful meal here and were impressed by the extremely helpful staff.
"This is a real find and if you get here and there is space, you will not be disappointed."
"We arrived mid-afternoon when a wedding party was in full swing but in the salon near the bar there were some tables for non-wedding diners and, fortunately for us, a table became free not long after we arrived."
The leg of lamb with aromatic herbs was the best we have ever tasted.
The staff were brilliant and had time for us despite being clearly rushed off their feet.
We'd most definitely recommend this restaurant.
"We went to this Tapas bar on the night of the Madrid vs Barcelona match, and had a fantastic time, great food, good wine, excellent atmosphere and lots of locals."
This place is excellent value considering its a minutes walk off Ramblas at Liceu.
"We had anchovies, olives, patatas bravas, calamari, sausage, all typical tapas and it was all delicious, they also hav a good wine list and sell some by half bottle ar cask wine by the glass."
"Even though it was busy, they were happy for us to stay at our table after we had finished eating, no pressure to go at all."
"The staff were great, the atmosphere was brilliant, and the price was very reasonable for the location."
Nice place with a very good meal!
"I love this place, very nice stuff, very friendly."
This is a fantastic restaurant frequented by locals..make sure you book if going on a sunday lunchtime!
"The hosts Marie and Francesca (mother and daughter) and Marias other daughter is the chef, they always elcome you with a warm friendly welcome and the food is fantastic, the paella is ...words cant describe ...beyond fantastic..make sure your hungry the portions are huge!"
Its extremely clean and good value for money ..Marie and her daughters will make you feel like you are an old friend!
Myself and now husband ate at this great restaurant during our previous two visits to Barcelona in 2005 and 2006.
I am planning a trip back and intend to return to Cometacinc.
We had lovely meals on both occasions...in fact I ate the same main both times; the seared tuna which is cooked to perfection seared so it is ruby red in the centre jand so good.
Loved it.
Not the cheapest restaurant but not the dearest by a long shot in what can be a rip off city.
The service is great too.
But do beware if visiting in Winter keep your wits about you as the Gothic area can be a bit seedy at night time.
"We liked the look of Cometacinc (in the Gothic Quarter) as we walked past, and were lured in by the offer of a glass of free ""Champagne"" each and the menu which contained enough vegetarian options to keep me happy."
"Well, unsurprisingly, the Champagne wasn't Champagne - maybe Cava, but I won't complain about a freebie!"
"Everything on the menu - tapas, mains and deserts - were expensive by average European standards, but we liked the sound of the food selections on offer and we ordered a few tapas."
"The ""real patatas bravas"" were simply a few skin-on chips served with some mayonnaise."
"The aubergine parmigiana was exceptionally good, but at c. €5 or €6 for 2 small pieces was somewhat overpriced."
"The chorizo was overcooked, tasteless and tiny."
The calamari was fine.
A small portion of shaved Manchego was delicious but c. €5.75.
"We left hungry, and with a hefty bill."
"There was no mention of a cover charge, either on the menu or from the staff - but they did put some tomato-covered bread on the table a few minutes after we arrived, along with a dip, so I expected a cover charge on the bill."
"We didn't eat the bread, but found a €2.50 charge for this specific item on the bill."
"We had asked for some tap water, and confirmed with the waiter that he knew what we meant, but ended up with another waiter pouring bottled water into our glasses, and another €2.50 charge."
"On the drinks menu, there is only wine listed, so you have no idea of the cost of water, soft drinks and beers."
"We ordered a couple of beers, and actually these turned out to be the cheapest items we ordered !"
"(Note that 7% tax is not included in the prices, but is printed on the menu) Staff were attentive when ordering, and not in evidence when you weren't."
"If you want to sit in a restaurant surrounded by other tourists and order overpriced and tiny portions of food, this is the place for you."
"great view the rest is ok, but def wort a visit, sit outside on the terass..."
"Just back from a great trip to Barcelona and this cool bar, restaurant was right next door to our St Augusi hotel."
Perfect for a night cap before retiring.
"Great place and staff, hid away from the bustling Ramblas."
Not everyone would find it but it was frequented by the local Barcelonians.
Always a good sign.
Can't wait to go back..
Really nice atmosphere but unfortunately staff and food leave much to wish for!
"I went out to have a nice and quiet meal but was confronted by an overinterested staff that were just out to here that I found the place great, which I did not."
"The look and feel they really got on the dot but then the food arrived..., Overcooked rice and noodles, sajoer lodeh (mixed veg with coconut milk that had gone off and another coconutty meat dish that they had tried to save..... but did not work and went bitter."
(had the ricetable and with one prawn per person did not particularly find it good value as other dishes weren´t to be called abundant.
"We were given a flyer for this place and usually throw them away, but something made us try it for once!"
"We shared 5 entres between the 2 of us, drank complementary Cava and i had a glass of wine, all for just €40!"
We we're that full up off the food we even skipped breakfast the next day!
"Would recommend the Raviolini and Tagliolini, very well presented and extremely tasty."
"Sinatra's has a lovely feel about it, just the right sort of light, excellent music and very friendly staff."
"If your planning a trip to Barcelona you must go here, its excellent!"
This is a bistro on a relatively quiet street in Triana.
"We were there for dinner, but I believe they also offered lunch and possibly breakfast/coffee in the AM."
"The decor is quite pleasant -- a bright and lively bistro with marble, polished brass, and giant windows facing the street."
There are tables and a bar.
"When we arrived, most folks were at tables, but the action gradually shifted to the bar, where the staff and customers engaged in lively conversation."
The food is tapas -- the usual Spanish fare -- though our waiter (who was very helpful and patience with our English) directed us to a Triana version of Salmorejo (the thickish version of gaspacho found at most tapas bars in Andalusia) and to a grilled fish special.
The fish was wonderful - a bass similar to branzino butterflied and salt-grilled on wood/charcoal.
One of the best dishes we had in Spain.
"Because we enjoyed the charming, casual atmopshere so much, we lingered over dessert and drinks, which included a massive cognac that it took us quite a while to complete."
Wish I remembered the brand -- it was quite good.
"Service here was very relaxed (slow some might say), but it's a neighborhood place with locals stopping in for a nightcap or dessert."
"The place was filled with good cheer, and I would seek it out again."
"There's much to do on the other side of the river, but Triana is well worth the 5 minute walk across the bridge."
"A true two star Michelin, this is a must to visit in Madrid, and worth the money."
Excellent wine list and a very spacious design.
Everyone raves about the hotel (yes it is that wonderful) but the restaurant is also excellent.
The special deal (choose three courses from about half the dishes in the menu for €32.50) is fantastic value.
Beware that some courses are huge.
I stuck to the local specialities - a selection of black puddings followed by hake in green sauce and only managed to eat my dessert because it was so delcious.
"We went back for another meal and just had three courses between the two of us - it was plenty, The room is a fantastic medieval hall and, like all Paradors, the service by waiting staff in local costume is perfect."
Looks really pretty and is a real tourist trap as it is close to the ramp to get into the Old Town.
Twinkling lights in the courtyard lure you in.
The starters were disgusting - really bad salads with bottled dressings.
Had paella as a main course which was passable.
Got charged a cover charge for olives and bread which we didn't ask for.
Wine (Marques de Carceres) was €4 more than in El Olivo up the road.
Service was grumpy bordering on aggressive.
This place obviously trades on it's location and pretty courtyard.
Once they've got you in they don't care about the quality of the food nor service.
Expensive and bad... You have been warned!
Having seen this restaurant get excellent reviews on trip advisor we went out of our way to find it.
We were greeted by some rather stiff waiters and ushered into an almost empty restaurant.
We were a family of five with three children under ten but attempted to order something authentic for our children.
They do not offer smaller portions of the more appealing dishes but we were offered and against our better judgement settled for 'meatballs' for our 6 & 7 year olds.
These dishes arrived and appeared to be meatballs out of a tin with chips on the side.
Our older daughter had the chicken (which also came with chips) although she said it was quite good.
Each dish cost 10 euros and we felt this was very overpriced and of very average quality.
"I had a plate of roasted vegetables, which was tasty-despite being drowned in salt, but at 13 euros very overpriced."
"My husband ordered lamb with pepper sauce which was fairly tasty although again, very overpriced (about 16 euros)."
We appreciate we did not try the fish as the 'John Dorrie' which the waiter recommended was 23 euros.
"Had we done so, we may have a slightly different view."
"By the time we were finishing our meal, the restaurant was getting busier mainly with older English/Menorcian people who I presume would have more of a disposable income and perhaps a dulled palate (hence the need for the salt)."
"Overall, the food was of reasonable quality (apart from the meatballs) but the atmosphere was stuffy and the waiters very superior."
If you have the money to waste and enjoy eating over salted food then this is your place.
"There are much better places to eat where the food is authentic, at a fraction of the cost but not in the tourist areas of Ciutadella Harbour."
The food was horrible and nowhere close to Indian taste.
"Many of the restaurants around the Cathedral serve inferior tourist food (avoid any place with the ""Paellador"" sign)."
"This place may not be perfect (indifferent staff, higher prices), but the food and atmosphere were worth it."
"There is outdoor seating, indoor seating, and restaurant seating upstairs."
We had tapas for lunch here.
"Don't remember all that we had here, but the mixed fried fish was remarkably good."
Just a hint of batter and just enough heat to cook the fish to melt in your mouth perfection.
Not heavy or greasy.
As long as you like fish (and don't like it overcooked) you will love this dish.
Quiet and elegant decorated restaurant far from the current ethno-kitsch.
Dishes are well prepared.
Unfortunately we were freezing with the air-con even though the temperature outside was cold
Casual and lively restaurant in a lovely backyard in Begur.
"Good food, excellent value and a lovely atmosphere."
"Not a gourmet-restaurant, but definitly worth a visit!"
"Great for romantic dinners, family-dinner or big groups."
We had beefcarpaccio (the best!)
"grilled tuna (good quality fish and perfectly grilled), cheeseplatter (boring selection of cheeses) and lemonsorbet (difficult to miss on this one)."
"Always crowded, so its necessary to reserve a table."
Remember to ask for a terrace-table.
The two best restaurants in town are this one and the restaurant inside the Aiguaclara Hotel.
4 codfish with no taste and stale bread = 70 Euro.
"Environment, decor, location are finethough...  And maybe tapas are what should be eaten there, not bacalao... All in all, I think there's much better value around."
"Wonderful food, excellent service."
The free tapas with your beer/wine are a great way to know what the food is going to be like and this one stands out from the rest.
Would highly recommend.
To get a good selection of cheese and meat all on one plate order the Tabla Castaneda Fria which is the cold selection and for the hot selection order the Tabla Castaneda Caliente.
Loved it all.
"From the outside-in, this place looks nice, but........ it seems like no one who actually works there knows what they are doing, we were told to wait for our table at the back of the restaurant, after ten min of waiting - no one came to get us, then we asked again and got our table which was still not prepared, then the waitress came and told us we could not sit there (She was quite rude), after sorting all this out, we finally ordered our drinks and food."
The worst of all - our food came before our drinks!!!
I've never seen that before.
"Horrible service, our ""argentinean steak"" we ordered was hardly argentinean and it was served uncooked (not even rare)...."
Steer clear of this place!
We accidently discoved this lovely restaurant and had lunch there.
"Food was excellent, well prepaired on nicely decorated plates and the recommended wine as great."
Not for big stomachs!
Went there a friday evening.
We took the restaurant-section on first floor (it also has a tapas-section at the ground floor).
"It was pretty crowded, but the waiter managed to fit us in."
It was truly delicious - and at an acceptable price.
"Hidden on a side street away from Plaza Catalunya, is this historic Restaurant."
During the afternoon it is a great place for a local beer and some appetizers as you mingle with both locals and tourists.
In the evening the dining room which takes you back in time and two another era opens up.
The food is exceptional and the service is very good.
Avoid!
We had an awful experience at this restaurant.
We were a group of 14 people and a baby.
"The waiters were rude, they did not want us to enter with the buggy and complains about how much space the baby would occupy The food was average - the meat very chewy In addition when the bill arrived, fortunately we checked it as we were surprise by the high price per head...we were in 14 and they charge us for 19 main courses and additional coffees and waters, in total an additional 150euro!"
Asked to review the bill they come back again with the wrong bill and 16 main courses.
"Tried to speak with the manager and the only excuse was, the waiter went home and he was not responsible as he wasn’t the waiter for our table No reason to go"
Enjoyed the decor of this rest.
We sat in loft in the main room and had a birds eye view of the goings on.
Food was OK and we enjoyed ourselves.
Was it the best food ever-no but definately something to do when touring.
We tried to make a reservation for Els Quatre Gats by phone several times but the line was busy all the time.
"Anyway, we went to the restaurant, at least to see if we could have drinks at the bar."
"The staff was amazingly friendly and they arranged us a table, even though the restaurant was packed full."
"Food was good, especially the salmon I had."
"My spouse had meat, it was okey but a bit ordinary."
"Starters were excellent, and so was the dessert!"
"I definitely recommend Els Quatre Gats, its atmosphere is something really special."
This was one of the highlights during our holiday in Barcelona!
You can smell the chicken cooking as you walk towards La Oca.
All of the chicken is spit roasted and seasoned to perfection.
My partner and I has Half roast chicken with fries and tomatoes.
Basic but very very tasty.
The wine was also good value.
We couldn't manage a desert as the main meal was so filling.
Lots of locals eating here which I always think is a good sign.
Would certainly go again.
"stopped here for a drink one afternoon earlier this month (May,09)."
It was a beautiful day and the view of the ALHAMBRA was amazing.
Service was great and the drinks were delightful.
We spent a great Friday night sitting outside sipping wine and people watching after exploring the neigborhood.
Great service and wine list.
Enjoyed the cheese plate and a few other tapas dishes.
They were to die for!
The ham croquettes were also very good.
"Lots of locals eating dinner there, so I'm sure it's good for more than just tapas."
This is one of the best restaurants that I've eaten in in Costa Del Sol.
The setting is beautiful and so is the food.
I would highly recommend it!
"Had a very good lunch here, all the food was delicious, service was fine."
"Menu was large, with a mixture of Spanish & local dishes, and also some italian, etc."
Would definitely return.
This is the place to go if you like to eat earlier rather than later.
You need to queue at about 8p.m.
for the 8.30 opening.
"Don't worry, there are street entertainers to keep you occupied."
The food is good and reasonably priced.
The house wine is very good value for a litre carafe.
Don't forget to ask for the excellent alioli with the bread.
"It is superb and not always given, although it is included in the bread price."
"The restaurant is in the Placa Real, very close to Las Ramblas, just south of the Miro pavement."
Don't be fooled by the long line or the table linens.
You will regret your meal at Les Quinze Nits.
"Yes, the food is inexpensive- correction: cheap."
Inexpensive would imply that there may be some value to dining at Les Quinze Nits.
"At the beginning of our week stay in Barcelona, we saw the long line and what appeared to be a nice looking restaurant and decided to give it a try on our last night there on May 26th, 2009."
What a terrible way to end the trip.
Where does Les Quinze Nits go wrong?
The food and the staff.
"First, the food was bland."
We started with the cheese croquettes and the potatoes with ham and (cheese?)
sauce.
"The croquettes were OK, but were something you could buy in the frozen section of your local supermarket."
The potatoes & ham dish had some “cheese” sauce drizzled over it; it tasted like Cheese Whiz.
Two of us had the gazpacho.
It had no flavor to it.
"For entrees we ordered the hamburger, meatloaf, tuna and the chicken breast wrapped around ham."
No complaints about the hamburger.
The meatloaf had little to no seasoning.
The tuna tasted fishy (not fresh) and was a very small portion (the best part about the tuna).
"Lastly, the chicken breast was drowning in a tomato-based gravy which attempted to hide the blandness of the dish."
"Overall, the quality of the food wasn’t any better than what you’d find in a grade school cafeteria."
"To add insult to injury, the service was the worst I’ve ever experienced in my life."
"The staff is rude, inexperienced and do not follow safe food handling practices."
"First, we were rushed to a table right next to service kitchen (upstairs in the back)."
We asked if we could be moved to a table away from the kitchen and were simply told “no” in a stern manner – the host promptly walked away.
"When the waitress came to take our drink order, there was no attempt to welcome us."
She simply came to our table and said “what do you want to drink?” Our appetizers and soup came in a timely manner and so did the entrees.
"However, the waitress made no attempt to remove the appetizer dishes."
They sat empty on the table through the entire meal.
"During our meal, we observed waitresses drop flatware on the floor and set tables with those pieces that had been on the floor only moments ago."
The staff dropped flatware or plates on the floor about five times in our area that night.
Then it came time to clear the entrée dishes.
Our table sat against a waist-high wall (capped with a ledge about 30 CM wide) that separated our dining area and the one next to us.
"The waitress scraped our plates in front of us, put the plates in a pile and set them on the ledge next to us."
"In addition, the waitress started to stack the plates from her other tables onto this ledge."
They may have well been placing them ON our table.
It was disgusting to have stacks of half eaten meals at eye level in front of you.
I finally had to place my cloth napkin over the dirty dishes.
"The waitress saw this, took the napkin off, threw the napkin on the ledge and took the plates away."
"In summary, it’s cheap and you get what you pay for."
Les Quinze Nits is not representative of dining out in Barcelona.
The food is not traditional Spanish cuisine; it’s more “American” or “International”.
"You’ll get better food, service and value if you go to KFC or Burger King down the street."
Avoid Les Quinze Nits in Barcelona at all costs.
Having found what i thought was a wonderful little gem ( the entrance is very impressive with a gorgeous setting in the coutryard) i was eager to try their menu del dia for 13 euros.
"The wine was pretty bad, the bread dry and almost stale, the salad - basically just some plain lettace, a wedge of tomato and a few bits of sweetcorn."
We then had lampchops with chips - which was exactly that!
Lamb cooked until shriveled.
Service is barely worth mentioning.
"All in all - go in, have a look at their courtyard, and then leave!"
"We stopped by here for lunch with the kids, friendly staff couldn't have been more helpful with high chairs etc."
"They've got a lunchtime snack menu with prices pretty much on par with other restaurants in the area, the kids ate from that and they were happy to split them a single meal."
"We adults went for the set menu option which was significantly more expensive, but food and supplied wine was excellent."
"On a recent State Department visit to Madrid right after Nicholas Sarkozy's visit with Spain's King, I learned that Sarkozy (referred as El Sarko in Spain) requested this meal from Jose Maria when he met with Juan Carlos."
I made it up to Segovia and had cochinillo at Jose Maria's establishment and it was mouthwatering.
The service and presentation were as good as Restaurant Daniel's at 1/3 the price.
Took two of my frinds to Tahini - not really sure about raw fish but we had lovely food The tempura veg and prawns were superb.
i think the key to eating here is to have maybe one or 2 dishes max we probably over ordered.
The Maitre D was excellent and we ate out in the garden area.
Different experience and good quality but be prepared to pay!
Gourmet and taste menu with matching wines superb.
"Golden egg, Foie Gras soup, coffee bean dessert just too name a few of the wonderful dishes served."
"Wine list spectacular, service impeccable."
Not a single dish that wasn't outstanding.
Will definitely reccomend to friends and return next time we are in Barcelona.
"I visited Iru restaurant in April 2009, and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"We didn't book, given that we were eating early (with a 20month old in tow) and it was midweek."
Most of the restaurants were empty but there was a scatter of other diners there.
The restaurant decor is modern with excellent attentive (but not too overpowering) service from an excellent english speaking waiter.
"The wine list was extensive, if not a little pricey."
The views are very pleaseant over the sea and away from any traffic.
"My starter of salad leaves- was a bit disappointing- being literally some salad levaes with a few chunks of feta and a drizzle of oil, but my husbands raviolone was amazing."
Our mains- suckling pig and paella were spot on and the chocolate souffle desert was amazing.
We speant a lot- but were celebrating so had cava as well as wine etc but it came in at around 40 euros/head.
The staff were very amenable and accomodating of our toddler and there were a range of very generously sized childrens meals.
"The presentation of the food was great and although the portions were small, they were so rich that it was enough."
"Having said that, the paella was HUGE."
I would love to go back there for classy food in a lovely restaurant.
A great restaurant!
It must be good since we eat there three times in a week and it is unusual for us to eat anywhere more than twice during our more usual two week holiday.
"The menu and prices were similar to most of the restaurants we looked at in Puerto Rico but the big difference with this one was the quality of the food, which was excellent, and the atmosphere, which was relaxed."
"The service was very good and the host, Peter, was very helpful in describing the dishes and helping to choose a wine that you would like and would go with the food."
His recommendations were not the dearest so you didn't feel you were being pushed towards the more expensive wines.
The chef Juan would always come out and check that you were enjoying your meal and would amend the veg to suit your taste.
Very accommodating.
Great food at good prices with a great atmoshere.
"The curries are nice, but I find that charging 5.5 eur plus 7%vat for a plain white basmati rice portion of 75 grams aprox is waaaaay too much."
"If I add to that a very very slow (albeit kind) service and some mistakes in the order and the account, it all makes me doubt I will ever return again, 40 eur per pax with house wine, no dessert, no coffe, no beer..."
You just get the 8 dishes that Marcelo chooses to cook that day but every one of the dishes we ate was perfect.
Mostly very simple - the best escabeche of mackerel I can imagine and an absolutely brilliant take on the local 'hake in green sauce' where the green sauce burst with flavours of green peppers and lemon.
"The kitchen/dining room may not be to everyone's taste as a setting but if you love food as much as us, then it was absolutely fascinating and gives Marcelo the chance to pop out with dishes personally."
Went to Marbella on a girls weekend and stayed in Princess Playa HOtel.
Great value -booked through trip advisor.
Found a great wee bar just along the road on the promenade called the Banana Tree.
The food was amazing.
Great for blokes as lots of big screen football.
Scottish owner was brilliant Thoroughly recommend this little gem.
I visited Jumbo Chinese on a trip to Lanzorate in December 2008.
The service and the food was exquisite.
Salted chilli squid and the crispy duck were to die for.
The portions are large and be sure to try different courses because this restaurant really hits the mark.
"This is one of the few, if not the only restaurant we found in the resort with a typically Spanish feel."
We got the impression that most of the customers were local and regular.
The menu is mainly fish and its not cheap.
"However, it is fresh, cooked very well and delicious."
The salted fish looked amazing and I wish we'd had time to return and ty this.
Sevice was good.
Disagree with other two reviews.
"This is a bad pub, not a restaurant."
Skip it.
Visited this restaurant for an evening meal 18 May 2009.
Recommended by manager at hotel.
Excellent selection of hot and cold tapas and desserts.
The cold tapas are displayed on refrigerated counter and the price is denoted by the colour on the edge of the plate you select and displayed on menu.
Our waitress did not speak English but this only added to the whole experience as I had to fall back on my schoolgirl Spanish and a flick through my English/spanish dictionary etc.!
A fun experience.
Wine was £9.95 euros for house red.
Hot tapas and main meals are displayed on a chalkboard on the wall and a really good selection.
Prices vary.
"We had garlic mushrooms, sobrasada sausage, patatas bravas, lamb on pitta bread, prawns."
The desserts are brought out to you on a large tray so you can make your selection - very hard as they all look delicious.
Worked out around 20 euros each which included 2 bottles of wine between 4.
We (four girls) chose this restaurant having read great things on the forums.
We hadn’t booked so waited a few minutes for a table but were happy to sit and have a drink at the bar and drool at the fantastic tapas on display.
Every dish we chose was delicious.
"Between four, we ordered two large salads, bread and oil, six tapas and two bottles of wine."
"That was plenty and ended up a very cheap, but extremely enjoyable, meal."
Highly recommended.
"Having read a variety of reviews of this place, we decided it would be worth blowing £15 on a cocktail just to see the place and have the experience."
How wrong we were.
We (a group of four girls) were the first to arrive in the early evening.
We were “spoken to” by the front of house man – ie we weren’t welcomed at all.
He followed us as we wandered around deciding where to sit.
"When we asked what each cocktail contained, he begrudgingly told us “vodka, Benedictine, fruit juice” with no friendly chat or welcome."
"When we asked for a few minutes to decide, he muttered something under his breath and walked away."
"After his attitude, we decided not to spend £60 on four cocktails and walked out."
We were welcomed with open arms by the delightful men in the bar opposite on the corner of the street.
They were incredibly friendly.
The bar was buzzing and our bottle of wine cost less than one cocktail.
"If you live in London, the décor in Abaco is nothing special."
It’s just an eclectic mix of items in a “Miss Haversham” type of setting.
"If you have money to burn then take the chance but, if not, there are plenty of other places to have a drink."
We didn’t regret walking out.
It was raining cats and dogs and we decided to drive around.
Finally we found a parking space and right in front of us was Ayo's.
It was lunch time so we decided to try it out.
A huge tented area on the beach with a monstrous Paella being served in the middle.
"The place buzzed with chat, atmosphere and laughter, this was the place to be!"
Service was brisk and friendly.
"My wife wanted to try the Paella, I had swordfish as the Paella has peppers and I am allergic."
She asked for lots of prawns as we adore seafood.
A big plate of Paella appeared with a side plate of extra prawns just for her.
Anybody who wanted extra Paella just went up and it was served without a quibble.
We relaxed and got chatting to people near us while the whole place throbbed with the talk and laughter of people out to enjoy the Sunday lunch and the atmosphere.
"The bill when it came was ridiculous it was so cheap, 24 Euros including the drinks and food, great value for money and well worth the trip."
This restaurant is wonderful...from the food to the atmosphere to the staff.
"REALLY, REALLY good."
Great wine.
Recently returned from a week in Fuengirola.
Ate out every night and found this to be our favourite restaurant by some distance.
"First of all its situation is very good, it is bang in the middle of 'fish alley' which we consider by far the best area of Fuengirola."
The decor inside the restaurant is very elegant without being overpowering and it is just about the right size not too big or too small.
"The staff of two waitresses and one head waiter (may well be the owner) are very efficient without being in your face, you get the impression that everything runs very smoothly."
We tried the a la carte menu one night and found it to be reasonably priced with a good choice but thankfully not two or three pages to choose from.
I picked the monk fish (absoutely perfectly cooked ) and my wife had the entrecote which she thoroughly enjoyed.
The following night we tried the 15 euro menu which again had sufficient choice to pick from but was not overpowering.
"I chose the goats cheese, entrecote and apple pie my wife picking duck pate, chicken kiev and strawberries and cream."
We both could not believe the standard and presentation of these dishes for only 15 euros.
Although the cheapest bottle of wine comes in at 13 euros we were certainly happy to pay 43 euros for a spectacular meal in beautiful surroundings.
If I were to have the same meal in a restaurant in Edinburgh I would expect to pay double this price and for the same quality and would be happy to pay it.
"If you are ever in or around Fuengirola, go out of your way to find this place you will not be disappointed."
"The first time we discovered Avenida was about 10 years ago and it was always a must when visiting Puerto De Mazarron, in recent years the Resurant has been totally refurbished to a high standard.a varied menu choice offers above average variations of local fresh produce and fish.The staff we have found have always been more than freindly and you always get a warm welcome when you return,  Over the years we have reccomended Avenida to many of our friends and all of them have been very impressed with the quality and service."
"Maybe there has been a changes in the managment, the service is terrible."
"The problem with our waiter ( from the Fillipines) was he act very rude when i complained about my sole meuniere, it was raw inside."
He took my plate away and after 15 minutes ( my family was ready) he gave me my plate back with a BLACK FISH!!
"Again I complained, again he was rude and told me to choose something else."
"He did not understand why I was very disappointed, I could chose something else."
"There was no sorry, no offered coffee."
"We payed a lot of money in a very nice looking restaurant, but after a terrible evening ( my birthday) So nerver again Parellada!"
"This is a ""local favorite"" according to Frommer's guide, but I think having a pleasent dining experience requires you to speak the local language."
"The menus are written in a variety of languages, but the translations are ""loose"" at best and don't really describe the dishes properly."
"We did our best to order, but the food we were served was not at all what we were expecting."
"The food tasted decent, but the service was very slow (even for Europe) and the prices were a bit more than I would have expected to pay for the quality of food."
"Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes... Also, I found it particularly apalling that our server tried to charge us 1.50E per person for bread (read the fine print on the menu)."
"This was recommended to us by a friend (and most travel guide books), but boy did this fail to live up to the praise."
The interior and atmosphere are nice and the prices for both food and wine are very moderate.
"Having said that, the food was mediocre and the service... well, rude or non-existant."
"We were a party of 7, none of us would go there again or recommend it."
i could write a long winded review but quite simply we have just had 2 evenings in the restaurant for our wedding anniversary and had 2 of our best meals ever and we have been to some fabulous restaurants in the world.
"Top tips... ask for the specials to be translated, go early - about 2020-, (before they open at 2030), book if you can, it is closed sat/sun."
The service is not top notch but the food makes up for it.
"the rack of lamb, quail or fillet steak and fois gras are all sublime."
my Wife and i ate here as it was listed in the travel guide book in our hotel as a top place to eat !!
Were do i begin how wrong they were !!!!
point 1 ) Manager so rude it was a joke as we could not speak spanish he treated us like dirt  point 2 ) food was nice but main meal was more like a starter in size we were both still hungry after our main meals  point 3 ) we were offered a desert on the house when we finally found an english speaking waiter to complain too but the deserts came up on our bill.
point 4 ) there was a small piece of glass in my desert after we had complained !!!
So please do not eat here even if it was free i would never eat there again on a return trip to Barcelona !!!
WORST NIGHT OUT EVER AT MERENDERO DE LA MARI BARCELONA !!!
!
"This restaurant is fairly new (july 08) and it's owners are a husband and wife team, Julio and Nuria."
The restaurant is modern and very elegant with seating outside as well as inside in a pretty garden.
Julio has a great curiosity for food and we sampled some outstanding fare.
"He has a wide knowledge of wines and his list includes a wine called Wrongo Dongo, a Spanish wine that can only be bought in England as it is so good an English man has bought the rights!"
"Having said all this, this restaurant is by no means 'snobby' and we found the prices extraordinarily reasonable (a baccardi and coke 4 euros, Wrongo Dongo 16 euros a bottle special of the day 3 courses 16 euros) for a restaurant of this quality."
Because we had booked half board in our hotel we didn't eat very much in the restaurant but we had coffee every morning and drinks in the evening and were welcomed regardless of whether we ate or not.
I wish we hadn't booked half board with the hotel as Flor del Drago is pure heaven for foodies.
"Word of warning though, do not expect junk food, this is real!"
We visited this restaurant on Wed 20 May for Lunch.
Brilliant place and excellent value for money.
Situated centrally just opposite C & A in a small covered centre.
The staff were really friendly and helpful.
Note - this is a real favourite with the locals and so not much English spoken.
Coffee only 1.10 euro and a bottle of house red wine only 5 euro.
"For 4 of us - tapas, wine and 2 x coffees total was only 43 euro."
Definitely recommend it.
"I booked this restaurant to celebrate my fiance's 50th birthday, the food and service was impeccable, and the setting beautiful, we had the taster menu which was worth every expensive penny."
The only downside was the sommelier didnt bother with us as we only ordered one bottle of not very expensive wine.
Wonderful experience tho if you are visiting barcelona do visit .
This place had come recommended to us.
First impressions were good.
"Nice surroundings, nice atmosphere, good service."
However - and we may have chosen the wrong things from menu -( I saw the sizzling meat platters and they looked good - don't know what it tasted like. )
We ordered peppers in garlic to start - there was 1/2 a pepper cut into two bits.
"For mains, I had grilled king prawns - there were 8 on the plate - no veg., no salad, no potatoes - nothing other than some shredded lettuce."
"Admittedly they were very good, but probably the most expensive prawns I've eaten at nearly £2 a pop!"
"My other half had what was laughingly called ""suckling pig""."
"This came as an over cooked, dried up lump of fatty pork."
A very dissapointing and expensive evening.
Small modern restaurant with neutral decor and clean lines and discreet interesting background music.
Very formal waiting staff and knowledgeable sommelier.
Initial service was disappointingly slow.
We were served our champagne without any nibbles or bon bouches to accompany it which we found disappointing.
"The wine waiter took our wine order and removed the wine list, but when he came back to tell us that the wine we chose was 'finished' we had to choose again from memory!"
"We waited 40 minutes for our order to be taken, and hubby had to get up and go to find someone to tell them that we were still waiting to order."
"We weren't hungry enough for the tasting menu unfortunately, so we went for lobster bolognese and pork with mango tatin."
"The food, when it arrived was wonderful."
They obviously have a 'foam' kick going at the moment - every course that arrived had 'foam' on it - just different flavours.
"Hubby had almond creme for sweet, but couldn't taste any almonds!"
The bill was ridiculously high compared to the meal we had the following evening at Con Gracia - which was just as good!!
No - we won't be going back on our next visit to the beautiful city of Barcelona - not because it was too expensive - but because we just didn't enjoy the snobbish atmosphere.
We went for an early lunch (around 1pm) and the place was mostly deserted.
Drinks were cheap and there were plenty of tapas and raciones to choose from at a reasonable price.
They are large portions so do not order too much - you can always order more.
"Service was quick, but minimal."
"Nice place to stop at, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Although I only ate here a few times, I loved the cozyness of the place Great pancakes and eggs."
"Milk is the sister restaurant to Marmalade, my favorite restaurant bar in the whole of Barcelona."
"It is like the older more mature sister, with a calm and relaxed atmosphere and good music to accompany their great brunch menu."
It's a little tricky to find though if your not too familiar with the Bari Gothic and its maze of little streets which I wasn't when I went in search of it!
"Persevere if you get disorientated however, it's most definitely worth a peek!"
Great cocktails and fantastic food as well as a fun chilled crowd.
Top.
I visited this bar in Feb for Sunday brunch.
"It was perfect...chilled out music, quirky decor and good food and not forgetting all the Irish Sunday papers!"
Enjoy.
"Excellent location, right in the middle of the city centre; cosy, welcoming atmosphere; very good food; and for dessert, one of the best (if not THE best!)"
cheesecake I have eaten in my life!
Hadn't been to the Olive Tree for a while and so on our most recent trip we dropped in un-announced.
"A warm welcome, bottle of house white (very drinkable), lovely starter, main course, dessert and tea/coffee."
The food quality remains as good as ever as does the friendly service.
The food is only ok.
"The service is average, not exactly friendly, though not unfriendly either."
The atmosphere is perfect if you´re looking for something very much on the tourist track and with a feeling of being mass-produced...
I can´t say that we´ll be back...
I knew I was in trouble when the only Spanish speakers in the restaurant were the employees.
Every tourist in Barcelona was there.
"We ordered a wide variety of items, calimari, lamb, monkfish, patasas bravas, even dessert."
All of it was mediocre at best.
"The prices are really not worth the value of the food, and like others have said the staff tries to upsell you on items like pan con tomate (tomatoes on bread)."
The setting for the Placa Oriel Taller de Tapas was really nice.
Just be forewarned that Taller de Tapas.
"The place is wonderful, in a small cohort(even if a little bit windy)."
"The food is goof (nothing so exciting), try the squid."
The price is average.
My wife and I arrived late in Barca...we were just walking around and stumbled into the place.
"Little touristy as we noted before we went in (due to the mounds of travel review stickers on the window), but hey Barca is an international city."
The place was great!
Good energy...it felt like NYC.
"Cheap wine (10-15 euros for the bottle), tapas prices ranged between 3-8 euro."
"Great little chain - reasonable and staff were friendly and happy to help - doesn't have an ""authentic"" feel to it but service is quick and the food excellent - probably better to try on a lunchtime as evenings are better to try the local restaurants with geniune Catalan cuisine"
We visited Taller de Tapas on a recommendation from Frommer's guide and we had an excellent dinner!
The food was fantastic!
"The menu is in English and in Spanish -- I typically shy away from places like this as they are often ""touristy"", but this was not at all."
It is a very cozy restaurant and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
"We ordered a bottle of the local wine/champagne (called ""Cava"") for 22E."
We ordered 6 tapas (including lamb) and our total bill came to 62E.
It was our best meal in Barcelona!
maybe those with good reviews of this place were luckier than us.
We had a reservation for 8 people and they weren't prepared for us- squeezing us into a small table.
then they forgot several items that were ordered.
the tomato bread was cold and had been prepared a long time ago.
the paella was not very tasty.
the prawns were tiny.
the waiter had to be asked mulitple times for things before we would get them.
desserts were obviously prepared well in advance and sitting around.
It was not a horrible meal but also not as good as other restaurants in Barcelona.
We went to the location on Sant Josep
"Even if you aren't staying in Corca, this restaurant is worth a visit if you are in the area."
"It has a really nice variety of delicious, very reasonably priced tapas."
The wines are also good.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
There are separate smoking and nonsmoking rooms as well as a lovely outdoor dining area.
The service is excellent.
"If I lived nearby, I'd be a regular."
Right on Catalunya Square so a brilliant central position.
Airport bus stops round the corner from it.
And taxi point is right beside the buses.
So very accessible.
It was packed which was a good sign.
"A couple of hosts welcome you in, were told it would be about a 40 min wait for a table which we said ok and put our names down."
"They give you a buzzer and when it goes off, ur table is ready."
We went to the bar and ordered a few drinks.
Nowhere to sit but within 10 mins we had seats.
And it was about 15 mins later our buzzer went off.
I think half of the time the hosts tell u a slighter longer time just incase.
"Waitress was lovely and bubbley, introduced herself and asked if we needed another drink."
"Menu has a lot of choice on it from steaks, burgers, salads, chicken and a few of their signature dishes."
We both opted for the HRC burger and it did not disappoint!
"Couldn't finish mine it was that big, fries were lovely!"
We both would have loved a dessert because they sounded delicious from the menu and looked gorgeous at seeing them going to other ppl's tables!
Waitress kept checking on us throughout the meal asking if it was ok or if we need a drinks topup which was nice.
Not too much tho that it was annoying which u find in some restaurants!
There is a small merchandise bit at the entrance.
"We paid 25 euro for 2 main courses with sides and drinks each which I didnt think was bad considering the euro rate at the time we went being so low and also paying for good service, food and location."
Would def return if lucky enough to return to Barcelona.
"Cute tiny Spanish place, the pizza is awful."
"Absolutely no sauce, dough is premade, greasy.. ew it was almost inedible"
I ate in this restaurant 2 nights out of three found it lovely food and on my second night ordered sirloin steak much to my dissapointment the steak was like rubber ordered a fillet steak instead asked for it well done and the steak arrived  pink and brought it to the attention of the mananger which was not on the reciept Found this very disspointing experience.and wouldnt be too fast in eating there again
"Despite the other reviews posted, there are better restaurants in Valencia."
See The Ginger loft and Restauante Babalu for better food at better prices and much more friendlier staff.
We tried D.O.C.
on our last night in Valencia and were excited to experience it given the reviews and the cave decor which was very cool.
"However, we were disappointed with the food and the service was terrible."
The food is just ok - nothing spectacular and no real flavour.
For the two of us without any alchohol or dessert we paid 60 Euros.
They mischarged us on our bill - so be careful.
If you want just ok food in a cave surrounding then this may be a place to try.
But if you want great food and want to feel like the owners really appreciate your business don't go here.
Go see Santi and Michael at the Ginger Loft.
You will have food that takes delicious and has lots of flavour and feel like you are having dinner at their house.
Babalu also had the same food and atmosphere.
We paid less than we did at DOC and had alcohol and dessert.
"We were in Valencia last September and through the recommendations on tripadvisor I booked this restaurant for our first night in Valencia via our hotel who were very helpful, it was a great start to our trip, I should have posted sooner."
"On our arrival the waiter was expecting us, and gave us a very nice table, the ambiance of the whole restaurant was wonderful the interior has been done out like a huge underground cave very novel and worth booking just to see it, our waiter was also terrific he made great recommendations of the menu we had a mixed seafood platter to start with which we shared it was delicious then I had a pizza, hubby had carbonara both were very very good, we had a nice bottle of wine, a couple of apperitifs and delicous coffee all in all a great night out, I would highly recommend when in Valencia to give this restaurant a try you will not be disappointed."
"I've only visited Comedor Enrique once, but I must say the food was very nice indeed."
"Good service, good wines, just a wee bit empty so therefore lacking in ""ambiente""...but it WAS midweek...dining room is very attractive."
Recommended!
This is exactly what we were looking for .
.
.an exceptional restaurant.
"Not for everyone's budget, it is a little pricey (we spent 155 Euros for 2 persons for 7 course special which includes 7 wines)."
"However, for what you get, this is well worth it."
Elegant setting and simply marvelous food and wines.
Our top restaurant for this 2 week vacation.
I took a group of 16 here for lunch.
The price was 12 euro plus 7% VAT for a 3 course lunch and there was a good choice of dishes.
"This place is a catering school and you are served by the trainees, who are first class."
The food was prepared in an imaginative way and between the group we tried most of the dishes.
There were no complaints.
You pay extra for the drinks and coffee but it is still a bargain.
I live 300 M from here and figured we would go check it out.
I eat mexican often in LA and New York and this might be good for Madrid but its not anything like good Mexican.
"If you are from Europe then for you it might be great, if you have been to mexico or the states you will be left disappointed."
First of all the portions were small.
"Mexican food is cheap food generally, and you expect some ""filler' of beans or rice."
You wont get that here.
"I would have had to order 3 entres to get a meal (I am not fat, but I have had more food off the back of a truck in LA for $2 then from here for 15 euros)."
"A side of guacamole was 8 Euros for about 1 avacado worth and wasn't that good (no lime, onion, etc, just a mashed avacado)."
Generally the food was over cooked and uninspiring.
It was a Spanish version of Mexican food.
"We complained on the way out and the manager said, ""come back and I will give you a big plate of real mexican!"""
I haven't taken her up on the offer.
"There is another Mexican place on the other side of Segovia 150M away which is about the same (not reviewed) but also uninspiring, over-cooked, and yet another on Segovia on the opposite side of the wall that the restaurant shares with the adjoining street (never eaten there)."
My advice would be that if you crave Mexican make it at home because there are no good Mexican restaurants in Madrid.
We visited Shunka on 10 May due to the great resorts on Trip Advisor and Ihave to say we were hugely disappointed.
"This is a spit and sawdust restaurant with rude staff, a limited menu, average food and a serious lack of atmosphere."
We definately won't be going back.
"On our recent trip to Madrid, we had the pleasure of dining at Matritum (we had tapas only, no entrées)."
"I was delighted to find Catalonian tapas on the menu -- if they're in season, I especially recommend the calçots a la plancha."
"Other standouts were the gambas on puff pastry with some sort of marvelous garlicky cream sauce, and one of my favorite tapas, pan con tomate / pa amb tombaquet (bread rubbed with fresh tomato, garlic, and drizzled with olive oil.)"
"We really enjoyed our meal here, and would have returned twice in the same trip if we'd had an extra day in Madrid!"
Our Spain guidebook highly recommended this restaurant.
"When we mentioned it to our concierge in Seville, he had been to the restaurant and also raved about it."
"So, my expectations were high."
"When we sat down to dinner, the menu was fixed price."
88 euro for 3 course 98 euro for 4 course or 118 euro for 5 course dinners.
The price was higher than we expected.
"But, we stayed and anticipated a wonderful meal."
"A few courses were outstanding, others were just fair."
"For the price, I expected all to be outstanding."
We had a dinner the previous night in Seville that was truly outstanding!
"Our dinner for 4 was around 100 euro, about the cost of one dinner at Atrio!"
We wished we were back in Seville at Vineria San Telmo!
"To be fair, the atmosphere was beautiful and the service was very attentive."
"But, the quality of the food is most important to me."
we visited this restaurant earlier this month (May 2009).
we were four in the group.
every dish we ordered was delicious - well prepared and presented.
service was excellent and ambiance great.
"Located right on Placa Catalunya, with tables outside as well, this place is ideal for people watching in probably the busiest placa in town."
Of course it's going to be more expensive than the cafe in FNAC round the corner!
There's a premium to be paid for location!
Decent coffee and perfectly good service.
It's unlikely you'll want to linger here all day but it's ideal for a quick coffee or beer while you're waiting for someone or if you're on your way somewhere else.
"We found this restaurant a couple of day's in to our holiday, and we nearly always try a different restaurant each evening whilst on holiday, so for us to have gone back 4 times, really shows that we were impressed with this one!"
Run by husband & wife Lupe & Sergio - they were so friendly and welcoming!
"Sergio flambe's amazing melt in the mouth steaks in front of you, and creates a wide variety of sauces to accompany them - what we even better was that as it was quiet in resort they were offering 2 for 1 on all main courses in the varied menu."
Live music and entertainment every night too - Highly recommended!
"Ok food, nothing special."
Great location on the edge of the historic downtown Sevilla.
The position is great.
Cheap if compared with other restaurant in that area.
"Fish dishes are special, try the Paella to taste a rice perfectly cooked and a savory haddock."
"We just arrived back from Benidorm and thought we would try a meal out here without the kids as we were stopping at the flamingo oasis and fancied a change instead of just eating in at the hotel all the time, we order 2 meals from the special menu and found them to be lovely, at the end of your meal you get a small chinese drink, normally at other places this gets brought out to you but here we were given 2 bottles of it, one alcoholic and one non alcoholic incase you didn't drink which I thought was a nice touch."
"The stafff were also very nice and dressed smartly, we are back in Benidorm at the end of October 09 for 2wks, this time stopping at the Gemelos 22 which is just down the road so we'll be here quite often then."
Keep up the good work china garden.
A lovely Parador and a good breakfast.
"But whatever you do, don't eat lunch or dinner or here, it's a scary experience and expensive too."
Instead eat at La Bola which is practically next door.
We are staying at the lovely inn associated with this restaurant.
No complaints thus far.
But the restaurant is something else.
Initially one is pleased - the room is gracious and atmospheric.
But almost immediately the lack of service begins.
We order still water - it does not arrive and we are well into our appetizers before a waiter comes close enough to be flagged and asked for it.
The wine is fine but we have never before had a bottle opened and smashed into the ice bucket without the offer of a taste to be sure that it is acceptable - until now.
The wine - which we pour for ourselves - is fine.
But no waiter ever returns to pour any or inquire as to its acceptability.
"The fish entrees are good and fresh, but accompanied by vegetables that are obviously canned."
"No one ever comes near to inquire about whether we are happy or would like more bread, or anything."
"After an interminable wait after coffee, we are able to signal a waiter for the check."
The tip is included.
We politely leave a few extra euros and vow to write a fair review.
Bottom line - there must be somewhere better to dine in Cordoba.
I visited this restaurant with my husband and cousins on 4th May 2009.
We had read good reviews and also that it was Tony Blairs favourite place to go!
That should have sounded the alarm bells!!!
Service was really poor - plates were removed before everyone had finished eating and the waiters were queueing with the main course as we finished our starters!
"Food was average - not sure of final bill as my cousin paid but we most certainly would NOT recommend this restaurant for quality, service or atmosphere."
"Expensive, but nice atmosphere, not the greatest of food."
I had better meals in Barcelona at barceloneta.
"however, they will bring you wine with each course, so thats a nice touch."
I promised our wonderful waiter (He informed me that he always uses Trip Advisor for his own travels!)
that I would post upon our return.
We had lunch at Con Cracia last Wednesday.
"After having read so many terrific reviews, we e-mailed a reservation request for our last afternoon in Barcelona."
"The restaurant has just a few tables, so it is important to book ahead."
Con Gracia is on a tiny street in a fashionable neighborhood near the upper end of La Rambla.
"It is simply decorated, but very stylish."
"We selected the ""Surprise Menu,"" whereby the chef makes the decisions, and we wholeheartedly approved of his selections: Risotto with bacon and broad beans, Sea bass on a bed of lentils, and ginger/green tea creme brulee."
"For 22 euros (plus extra for glasses of cava and wine and coffee), excellent value considering the quality and presentation of the three courses."
Our waiter was most attentive and enthusiastic about helping us with the cava and wine.
It really was a wonderful experience.
Small intimate restaurant with modern decor.
"Welcoming friendly, knowledgeable and professional staff."
Superb traditional menu - the fois gras soup was unbelievable - a lifetime best soup!
The bass (with lentils) was heavenly and the wines were delightful.
We loved it.
Our best meal in Barcelona by far - and the previous evening we had been to Abac!
I have just returned from Barcelona.
Dining at this restaurant was one of the highights of my trip.
The food was quite simply divine.
I am a food lover and I have tried various Michelin star restaurants in the past and none of them except Lucas Carton was able to match the quality of its food.
It was so good that I had to go back there for lunch on the next day as I really wanted to try their other dishes.
"In total, I have tasted 10 dishes( I will not write them here as they are on the 'surprise' menu) and out of that, 9 dishes were of exceptional quality and the remaining one was very good."
"I then went to Alkimia ( with 1 Michelin star) for dinner on the same night and just as I feared, the food quality there was good but it did not even come close to Con Gracia."
It is such a travesty that this restaurant is not more well known and recognised other than on Tripadvisor.
my husband and I went twice during our short stay in Barcelona and would have gone a third time if we had another day.
definitely worth a visit
"My wife and I ate at Con Gracia last Saturday night, having booked based on the strength of the trip advisor reviews."
We were not disappointed!
"We were lucky to get a booking, I called about 10 days before and only managed to get a table because there was a big football game on that evening and the locals were staying home."
We had some trouble finding the restaurant as its tucked down a small backstreet but got some directions from the owner over the phone.
We both went for the surprise menu (5 dishes plus cheese) and it was fab.
My wife does not eat meat so it was no problem for them to come up with a vegetarian and seafood option for her whilst i still had one meat dish.
The restaurant owner / maitre d also selected wines for each course and matched these really well.
"I had a miso soup with foie course followed by squid sashimi, some cod, lamb, cheese and then creme brulee."
I cannot remember the little details and won't try to describe each course but can confirm it was excellent.
I would say 2 of the 5 courses were amongst the best i have ever had and the other 3 still very good.
The wines were superb.
The service was probably the best element of the evening.
The 2 staff knew the food and wine so well and were full of information but not in an over-bearing way.
"The only slight criticism is that there was not really a spanish feeling to the restaurant, the style is very modern and minimal."
Not a problem though.
If you do plan to go then definitely book ahead.
"Also, do not expect it to be cheap."
I think we paid around 180 Euros but i think it was well worth it.
My wife and I went here in May 2009.
"A very cute, romantic, cozy tapas bar."
The food was good and the menu has english on it (one of the waiters spoke english very well).
The fried asparagus was the best!
"This is a great place if you are an American tourist looking to find something that feels ""authentic"" and just a tad off the main tourist track."
Plus the street it is on has lots of tapas places making it good for tapas cruising.
"We ate at the Gino's at Mare Magnum, down by the sea on a Sunday afternoon."
We had three adults and three hyperactive kids (5-7 yrs) and there were plenty of families there and therefore no big problem with the kids making a bit of noise.
"They got helium balloons and crayons, etc."
which keep them somewhat occupied.
Food was generally good and everyone was well fed!
Etxanobe is about 20 minutes walk from the Guggenheim and even shorter if you take the tram (one stop) to the Euskalduna Palace.
It certainly deserves more than the one Michelin star it has earned... Food is outstanding; langoustine cru and a crispy pigeon as part of the tasting menu come to mind.
Superb wine list at very reasonable prices.
Impeccably professional and personable service... What more can one ask for?
"Well, one can wish for a sunny day so that one can eat out on the terrace, as we were lucky enough to do..."
Chef Etxanobe is also very warm and interested in your experience.
He very kindly signed his cookbook for us and another one for a friend who had to leave on an emergency...
Highly recommended...
"We ate here because it was convenient, affordable, and had an English menu."
"The food was fine, but nothing too special."
Try the spinach ravioli; it was great and under 10 euro.
(Most entrees were 8-15 euro and huge portions).
The sangria was also delicious.
"Our server was friendly, but a little slow to bring over the check at the end of the meal."
"Food came quickly, though, which was a huge plus because we were starving at the end of a long day of sightseeing."
"Not very central, which makes me think it's a place for locals."
"It's not exactly on Calle Felipe, but just off this road."
Parking was free.
In the evening they open at 9.
Decor may be in need of an update but food is of very good quality.
Impression is that they have been in the business for years.
"We were worried that the no-menu meal, of several courses, could result in an expensive bill, but prices were reasonable."
"We spoke in Spanish with the waiters, so don't know if they speak English."
"Of the various courses, our favourites were salmorejo (the best we've had in Andalusia) and rape (anglerfish)."
Would definitely go again.
we eat at this restaurant whenever we visit Vejer.
"The food is always very good, although the desserts are not to our taste."
However after a starter with their lovely bread and a main course there is no room for dessert anyway!
I also went to the Cheers Bar in Cala Millor during the week of 01 May 2009.
Every thing you have read about it being a great bar is true - it is most definately the best bar in Cala Millor.
"The prices are right, the food is excellent value for money and delicious - just make sure that you turn up hungry."
Kevin's portions are belly busting in size!
Opt for a good old prawn cocktail and a lasagne - i bet you can't get through it !
still you can then work it off on the wii fit or pool table.
If you just want to sit quitely they'll lend you an English paper .
Kev and Steph are adorable - go in and give them a big kiss from me!
Julie - Manchester.
p.s If you're changing money go to the bank Marche in the next street to Cheers - that was the best rate i found .
"Pascal La Restaurant, Lucila Barrios, 1, Los Cristianos."
My wife & I visited Pascal's restaurant twice on a recent visit to Los Cristianos & what an experience.
"The first night we were presented with an amuse bouche of fab couscous with feta cheese, we then shared a most unusal starter of scallop & squid cooked in a tempura batter & served with sauces & a shaving of pickled ginger, we think!, it really worked!."
"This was followed by a surperb navarin of lamb, which was probably the best lamb dish we ever tasted on holidays, & a fantastic chicken tagine, which was a surprising twist to the usual tagine, a great surprise."
Dessert was a gorgeous creme brulee followed by two excellent expressos.
We returned a few nights later & had another fab meal.
A started of warm scallop & bacon salad which was fab.
"Mains of casserole of rabbit which was super with beautiful gratin potatoes & veg, & the navarin of lamb which again was mouth watering."
"A new dessert was added to the list that night & we tried it, meringue stuffed with home made vanilla ice cream & served with a hot chocolate sauce, so good!."
Two coffees & a complimentary after dinner drink finished the meal beautifully.
"There was also a blackboard of specials available each night including snails, frog legs 7 other French treats."
"Each night, the cost of the meal including a good bottle of wine & mineral water was about €75, well worth it."
A very talented chef with a super maitre d' are a great team & this restaurant must be visited by anyone who likes good food.
It is a little hard to find but only a stone throw away from the usual 'touristy' restaurants.
Very crowded hard to get a table and I can understand why!
"Great ""tapas"" even though they are not that Spanish, but hey those one you can have at any other place."
I'm still dreaming about their delicious salmon/creme cheese tapa...
this restaurant was recommended to us by friends and it didn't disappoint!
"We had a fantastic dinner, it really does have the 'best fillet in town' The meat is cooked on a charcoal grill and the quality and flavour of the steak was amazing!"
Luckily we had reserved a table outside because it was so busy.
The restaurant is in 'fish alley' an area that is popular for restaurants and bars and it had a great atmosphere.
"The service was excellent, the waitress was very attentive, we didn't have to wait for anything but we didn't feel rushed either."
We had plenty of time to relax and enjoy our meal.
"I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you like meat, it really is steak heaven!"
was in a group of 8 girls and we all really enjoyed it.
"on arrival we were given the menu which was all in spanish, we asked had they any english versions but they didn't."
our waiter didn't speak english either so we were lucky we had a spanish speaker with us who was able to translate.
"in saying that the atmosphere, food & value for money definately made up for it."
we nearly all had different food and everyone was full of praise for their dishes.
definately one to visit if you want some great italian food
"With the friendly, attentive staff and excellent menu of traditional Spanish dishes, this charming spot is a restaurant we all enjoy."
I especially like sitting outside in the courtyard and watching the world go by as we relax with a wonderful meal.
The waiters are helpful and efficient and I felt you could enjoy a lovely leisurely meal and never feel rushed.
The tapas were good and the menu was in several languages which makes ordering easier... though the staff seem to speak a number of languages.
Prices are very reasonable and the menu del dia is great value.
Francisco II feels like a family place and when we went back a second time we were greeted with warm smiles and the waiter remembered our favourites.
Our food was always great and it is a place we return to again and again.
This is the best restaurant in town!
"Some meny mistake and arrogant waiter, boring dessert."
apart from that very good restaurant.
"The food and service at Eleven have always been good, and our most recent visit (May 9 2009) was no exception."
Nice starter and a medium-well steak which was cooked exactly as requested.
My only reservation with Eleven is that smoking is allowed.
We were fortunate to get through dinner but were eventually chased out by the blue fog from the next table.
"Hard to recommend Eleven for this reason, which is a shame as the food is great."
"Great staff, good basic food, great views."
"Suitable for everyone, i think the owners are Dutch and very nice indeed."
"Stumbled upon La Luna, looked busy so dropped in."
Bar was buzzing so settled in for tasty cocktails and a bit of people watching.
The kitchen seemed to be busy (always a good sign) so decided to grab a table it the fabulous restaurant.
What a setting!
Truly Gothic Barcelona.
"Food was near perfect, and staff were knowledgeable and very helpful."
After dinner we partied in the bar.
All round great place.
my wife and I had an evening meal at La Luna for my birthday and the food and wine was very good .
The restaurant is in a very old building full of character but also relaxing and the prices are about right for the quality of the food and the surroundings.
"First things first: the food here was actually quite good (although that was to be expected given the price); the only letdown were the desserts: there were few to choose from, none of them very original, and the creme brulee I finally had was not especially good (which is particularly disappointing given the tradition of this dessert in Catalonia)."
"I also found a couple of other ""buts"": 1) the lively atmosphere, although great for a bar (I will probably come back in the future for drinks with friends), was far too crowded and noisy for a restaurant."
"Also, it's so full of tourists, that as a local I felt somewhat alienated; and 2) the service was frustratingly slow; there were only three waitresses for the whole dining room, and though they tried hard, they just couldn't cope."
I had seen a review elsewhere for La Luna and decided to try it since it was recommended.
Everyone loved it.
All 7 of us had something different and everyone was quite satisfied with their choices.
For 7 of us with drinks dinner was only $267 so not so bad on cost either.
Not as easy to find being down a little alley.
"We had no idea what this would be like, both negative and positive surprises."
"The food was served without plates, only a fork and a napkin."
"Good tapas at this price, but be prepared to get greasy fingers..."
"Friendly and nice service, precisely as unpretentious as the food."
"Place to eat and drink with friends, not for the perfect romantic evening."
I visited here in October of 2007 and thought the place was fantastic.
The service was second to none and the food delicious.
I recently visited again in April of 2009.
This is now one of those places that suffers from too much hype.
They seem to be resting on their past merits.
"The food was exactly the same, which was slightly disappointing but even more disappointing was the service."
We were treated as if we were bothering them.
The prices are inflated and I'm sorry to now say but I would not recommend this place.
It's sad as the thought of a fantastic find that hides behind an unmarked entrance/hallway and the cavern style interior is the perfect setting for a true foodie adventure.
"I have been at this restaurant since their opening in 1987, it has always been an expensive restaurant, so I bet anyone to try to eat for the €18 anounced in this page."
"Menu and vine list are good, but the fact that the King of Spain is seeing here very often when on holidays in Palma, makes this restaurant too glamorous and crowed during the season, and has the prices accordingly with the demand."
Service then is very pushy.
Six of us went there midweek on our holidays and spend our last few days eating there for breakfast and dinner.
The staff were so polite and the service was quick.
There are a credit to the place deffinately 10/10 for service.
"The food was fab, delicious and very generous portions no matter what you ordered(10/10 too)."
Was the best place we had eaten in the week we were there.
I go to salou a lot and i always visit this Uncle sams
It was a shame that our first - and much anticipated - evening was spent here.
We wanted to stop for a pre-dinner drink and tapas at the recommendation of our hotel.
"We sat down outside enjoying the view of the cathedral, and ordered our wine."
"A second waiter came and asked us if we were there for dinner, we said no, and he ordered us inside."
"We got inside, and when we only ordered the jamon iberico, they lost interest."
"We paid way too much (after seeing other choices around town), and the service was arrogant and inattentive."
"They did not even clear the napkins from the previous guest off of our table, and we had to flag down waiters to give us silverware."
Walk in any direction and you will find many other choices!
We loved this place.
An unassuming taberna right off the Plaza de Santa Ana that's perfect for a drink and tapas.
The jamón is sliced fresh in front of your eyes and the plates of crisp yet tender calamares appear almost instantly.
"The beer is cold, the sangria is tasty, and the atmosphere is lively with locals."
The service was top notch too - the waiters were prompt and kind.
Don't miss it!
Its a small restaurant situated just off the N-340.
"Its quite small from the outside, but suprisingly larger in."
"Try to book early, since no one turns up till 8, so if you book for 7:30, you are bound to get your first course before the crowd arrives."
"I would certainly recommend their large sirloin steaks, which can come with a variety of sauces, or there is a good The menu is big enough to satisfy all."
The only drawback is getting the bill can be a little slow if it's busy.
I can´t left Madrid without having for dinner here.
"Lovely place at all, and no expensive at all."
Must Taste!
!
Our favorite spot in Madrid.
Great cosy atmosphere.
Excellent wine selection and good tapas.
We especially liked the warm cheese salad and the scallops.
We arrived early by Barcelona standards and were asked if we had reservations.
"When we said no, we were told that the only table available was by the kitchen."
"In fact, when we were seated, there were many other tables in the restaurant which were never taken during our entire meal."
"The table was nicely set, but two wine glasses on the table had lip marks on the rim from the prior users and were returned to the kitchen."
No water was offered.
"No wine list was offered, only the menu."
We ordered glasses of wine.
The waiter poured from a bottle as though this was a tasting- to a level of about 1/3rd in a small glass.
The menu offered halibut which I ordered.
"What was served was not halibut, but rather was a local fish- Rodaballo- which was under cooked- served mushy- with skin on, at a cost of 24 Euro's."
"They did not tell us that we would be charged for two small bread rolls which we did not order, but a charge of 2 Euro's per person appeared on our bill for the bread."
"The bill also included a mandatory donation to a charity - ""Donativo a Fundacion G.T."
"Ninos del Mundo."""
The service was poor.
The staff appeared very self-important.
There are many other restaurants in Barcelona which serve much better cuisine and have much better service.
We were recommended to Vineria San Telmo by Maria at our hotel.
We can't thank her enough for her recommendation!
It was our best meal of our trip through Spain and Portugal and we did have other great dinners!
"From the foie gras with vanilla oil to the duck breast with chutney, we couldn't seem to stop raving about the wonderful cuisine."
My husband said the foie gras was the best he's ever had!
Another great choice was the bodegas souci naraja!
"The price was extremely reasonable, as well."
With wine we spent under $100 euro for 4 persons.
"When we raved to the waiter and chef about our dinner, the owner came over to the table to chat."
"After we talked, he sent complimentary glasses of dessert wine to our table with our dessert!"
Don't miss this gem!
We each ordered a salad/appetizer and a main course.
The chef sent out two yummy starters included with our entree.
Absolutely delectable cuisine.
Very creative.
Overwhelming wine list.
"Lovely service except for the maitre d, kind of pompous."
Went to this restaurant for my husbands birthday and our annivesrary.
"Fantastic restaurant, excellent food and staff."
"not to my taste at all, its stuck in a time wharp from the seventies"
"When you go to a restaurant the food deserves to be a top priority when evaluating the place, doesn't it?"
"So when a restaurant really fails to deliver tasting food (vegetables were dry as if they had been placed in a fridge for too long, my bechamel sauce tasted nothing, my tournedos tasted as if the meat had been frozen several times, even the tiramisu was bland and way below average), you really have to wonder how a place can keep it running."
This may have been a decent restaurant in previous years - however my visit felt like lost time and money.
Stay away from this tourist trap.
"Been Every year since it opened , and it justs get better ."
Lamb is a must .
"Great Frendly staff ,John and his Family make you feel very welcome Cant wait till next year to return 10 out of 10"
Had the best Paellas here for lunch.
"Tried with duck, the best by far, with lobster and seafood, all were excellent, recommend coming here just for them."
"The restaurant itself is big and decent, although we only came here for Paella"
"Out of the way restaurant, but well worth seeking out."
"Not cheap (particularly the starters) and not a huge choice on the menu, , but the care and attention to the fresh ingredients and preparation make the meal one to remember."
The hosts make everyone feel welcome
"After going to Tenerife for 20 years, I saw the reviews of this restaurant on tripadvisor and decided to try it."
Was only there for a week but ended up visiting the restaurant 3 times.
"Although it was quite expensive by Tenerife standards, it was well worth it."
A three course meal and drinks for three came to on average 100 euros...could not get that in England.
The staff were very friendly and accommodating and I would recommend this restaurant as the best I have ever visited in Puerto
We wanted something quick and easy and a bit more than a tapas.
"Manolo, the one and only hardworking waiter advised us to have a selection of tapas from the board at only 1.50 euros each."
"Whilst the portions were definitely tapas size we enjoyed a wide variety of dishes from simple potatoe salad, to prawns with alioli mayonnaise on toast, chorizo, and delicious cheese and iberian ham."
He also introduced us to tino verano - the andalucian drink of red wine and lemonade - absolutely delicious and refreshing and at only 2 euros well worth trying at least twice!
We had lunch three times at the Bubo bar.
Twice we were lucky enough to get a table outside.
Every dish we tried was excellent.
I particularly loved the eggplant with goat cheese.
The shrimp was also outstanding.
"German run restaurant between Los Llanos and El Paso, it is spanish restaurant for germans , neat, well cooked, efficient, maybe lacking some flair."
"Very tasty food, slightly more expensive than others."
Look for the giant Franchipani sign when you return from Los Llanos to Santa Cruz.
I liked the franchipani flowers
On 2 occasions I went to this restaurant for an p.m. meal.
On once occasion I was told it was fully booked despite it being completely empty at 8.45 p.m. and on the other they offered me a table at the bottom of a staircase again when the restaurant was completely empty that I declined.
Clearly single middle aged ladies such as myself are not wanted at this restaurant despite it being out of season in March.
"If you are single don't bother, they won't want to serve you."
we ate at this place 3 times in one week.
17/05/09.
"and 19/05 & 23/05 the first time we wandered in off the sreet at around lunchtime, took a table by the door, and ordered a fairly simplistic bit of lunch."
"the area where we sat was nice & clean, although on this visit, we didn't venture further into the place to see what the rest of it was like."
"the service was swift, order correct, staff nice enough, and it looked nice."
"2nd visit - evening meal, greeted on enetering by very nice, attentive waiter, and showed to an uostairs table."
"the tables upstairs (for 2) are overlooking the beach, and with the windows slid up (like train windows) you get a lovely sea breeze."
"The entire restaurant is lovely, very plush."
"there were quite a few large parties dining, mainly young/high school age holidaymakers, so noise was to be expected."
"we quickly placed our order, nothing difficult requested, my partner was served a totally wrong meal."
"he was given a chop smothered in sauce, when he had requested a burger."
so off it went back to kitchen - mine with it.
with both meals returning = correctly this time some ten mins later.
the well done burger was rare/med.
"we didnt complain, as they had given us a free drink by this point, and apologised again about the error."
no harm done really.
"until........ 3 rd visit - upstairs again, packed solid with a massive young party of diners, prob about 20/30 of them."
the noise was unbearable.
"screaming,shouting,singing, having some awards ceremony, where each & every person stood up & gave a speech & was heckled in some foreign european accent."
"the staff really should have advised us this was the case, and said it would be noisy."
but they didnt.
"and yet again, wrong order!"
me this time.
totally diff meal than what i had requested.
"meals sent back again, wait, wait, meals return."
"correct this time, but no free drink, and a half baked apology for the error."
"the worse thing about the whole thing was, he had double checked our order.......as he knew he had mucked it up a couple of days prev."
we couldn't get out quick enough after that.
"no good bye, eye contact, apology or anything."
"i also think the prices are somewhat over rated, esp now when everyone is vying for business."
most dishes have no veg.
"ie: homemade steak pie, in a dish with pie top & oven chips on the side, and thats it."
You are paying 9 euro's for this.
"if this place wants to attract the visitors that flock to llorret time & time again, it needs to step up its game."
"it should spend as much time on recruiting staff that can get an order right, and change its policy on veg & options (i asked for mushrooms......plain old mushrooms with a sirloin......no!"
we don;t do mushroom!)
we certainly won't be returning to give them a 4th visit.
"we gave this palce about 150 euro of our hard earned, and more fool us."
"it might be plush & clean but it lacks in service, choice & price."
"I could not help noticing that the majority of reviews of Taktika Berri are in Spanish, and of course, so are the people that dine here."
"It is not a tourist joint, though I was surprised that two of the waiters spoke excellent English."
"Upon walking into Taktika Berri, whether for lunch or dinner, you will notice clusters of people crowded around the tapas bar, enjoying themselves."
"In the back are a few understated, white table cloth tables that allow for a more peaceful dining experience, otherwise be prepared to stand with the masses along the bar."
"I prefer the tables in the back because I don't like standing while eating, especially in a crowded area."
"Overall, this is a great dining experience."
Omelet with cod is excellent and a very traditional Basque dish.
Clams with garlic also very good.
"Tuna with tomato and olive oil, as simple as it sounds, is noticeably different here versus other dining venues."
"I had a steak, and it was very good, but I had to send it back two times when I initially asked for well-done."
My colleagues had fried hake and it was excellent.
Wine list is respectable.
"Business dinner for three including wine, and a round of single-malt was 135 euro, very reasonable."
"Don't come here for the decorative ambiance, there is none."
It is not a place to go for your anniversary dinner.
"But, the food and the buzz of locals catching up after a day at the office makes it a favorite spot for me."
Undoubtedly the best place to eat rice in paella in Madrid (and probably one of the top 5 in Spain).
"Surprisingly enough, it is very very difficult to get a well prepared rice in paella."
"Maybe a couple or three places around Valencia and Alicante, Samm in Madrid, and.., that is all."
Whilst the food was good I would have expected significantly more for 130euro's for 2 people.
The most significant charge was 30euro for 4xlarge prawns (gambas) which the waitresss did not tell us when ordering.
We were perched at the bar with a 12 inch space in front of us which would be ok for a casual snack but not for a 130euro dinner.
If the prices were more reasonable I would strongly recommend but as it is definitely not.
Charming restaurant with a retro feeling to it.
"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant; excellent products, very well presented and very good."
"I cannot say the same thing about the service, my table asked for several plates, got a few the rest came half an hour later, at the moment of coffee and desserts we were told that we there were people waiting for the table."
"The restaurant has only 2 seatings 8.30pm and 22:15, we knew that from the beginning but if they had brought the food quicker we would have had time to finish the meal."
The food is a little expensive for its portions but as I said earlier of excellent quality.
This is traditional Basque fare at its best.
"Very cool place, with traditional Iberian hams hanging behind the bar."
"Wood is the decor motif here, so it reminds one of a traditional steakhouse, such as Ruths Chris Steakhouse from the States or The Keg in Canada."
"They were good enough to offer me an English menu, as I was struggling with the Basque/Catalonian version they featured."
You can imagine hoards of smoking Spanish business people meeting here for a power-meal.
See the pics for a good representation of what you'll get!
Nice escape from the busy streets of Sevilla.
Food was good and a bit different from the other local fare.
Good selection of local wines and very nice atmosphere made this is one of our favorite restaurants we visited in Sevilla.
Marmalade is an absolute must for even the most discerning visitor to this colourful and vibrant city.
With all the class and style of an Oscar winning leading lady Marmalade certainly gets my vote!
I stumbled across this not so obvious gem while walking a friends dog around the Raval.
With it's unassuming entrance I almost passed it by and what a tragedy that would have been as I ended up returning there regularly to have drinks at the bar as well as for dining.
The atmosphere is simply wonderful.
Even though Marmalade is just a short walk from the high intensity atmosphere of Las Ramblas (extremely busy tourist street) it feels like a world away.
"Once inside, the bright and inviting light of the impressive marmalade colored bar immediately draws you in to it's spacious yet exceedingly warm atmosphere."
The bar staff are instantly attentive and without any of the pretentiousness one normally finds in establishments that have invested considerably in their appearance.
"To the right the beautifully appointed restaurant serves up gastronomic delights, simple fare presented with a decidedly different flare."
I had a three course meal with a glass of wine for 16 euros!
"An incredible bargain, I would gladly have paid double just for the atmosphere."
My favorite dishes were the mixed salad with toasted chestnuts which gave it substance and a tasty crunch!
"For my entree I favored the Petit Romescada, monkfish, cod & jumbo shrimp in a Catalan Romesco broth."
Absolutely yummy!
I returned to Marmalade again and again during my months holiday in Barcelona.
I also checked out Marmalade's sister restaurant Milk on the recommendation of the staff.
"Although out of my way, that too was also well worth a visit, like the older more mature sister!"
I look forward to the day when I will be able to return to this wonderful city and and enjoy Marmalade's most welcoming staff and sample more of it's tasty culinary creations!
I absolutely loved it and cannot think of one thing that I actually disliked about the place.
oh!
"one more thing, the marmalade cooler (their signature cocktail) you absolutely must try."
I am not really a cocktail drinker but I was a complete convert to this one!
Was recommended this bar/restaurant by a bunch of friends who had a few great nights there.
The crowd are a nice mix of locals and tourists who seem to be up for fun.
Music was worldly and not too loud so we could still talk.
Ended up securing a table in the busy restaurant section even though it was just past closing time.
Staff were very nice.
Food was homely and well cooked with a nice mix of international and local dishes.
Good value too.
The bar got busy and lively after dinner.
A great night out
"Fantastic value, great atmosphere, wonderful tapas and snacks, difficult to spend much as the prices are so reasonable."
Basically a deli selling mainly local specialities with a dozen tables out front.
"Value, quality and location by national museum and Roman sites means it's very popular but worth the nervy/competitive wait for a table to come free."
Mixed plates give chance to try out a few things as many menu items may be unfamiliar.
"High on porky and cheesey choices (sometimes both on one bread) - inc black puddings, hams."
Not so good for dieters or vegetarians.
Seemed very popular with locals.
Staff friendly but can be difficult to attract their attention as it's so busy.
"In a city full a good and cheap restaurants, this one is not worth the price."
"Pompous setting, but the food was common and oily"
"This place was recommanded to us as one true, genuin Valencian restaurant."
"OK, the place is nice, located in a small street, right in the center."
"However, this was the only positive point about this place."
The food is hugely overprized.
The service is awfull and the food was not even that good.
"Never had such an louzy piece of fish (turbot, not the worst of fishes one would say)."
The waiters are just tired of life and should be sacked on the spot.
Try something else; lot's of better places nearby.
"I was just at Can Majo last week, it was just ok. We arrived about 20:30 and the place was empty but the owner told us they were all booked and to come back in an hour which we did and the place looked the same."
"Next we were seated next to a huge space heater, that in itself was not bad had it been a cool evening but it was a balmy night and the heater made it too hot."
"When i asked to turn off the heater or for a different table the owner once again told he was all booked, and he suggested my wife sit on the closer to the heater since women are always cold."
We finally managed to move to another table along fence which was quite nice.
The food was sub par.
We ordered a dozen oysters and they werre so salty we couldnt even eat them with HOT sauce on them.
The tomato bread was soggy and not very good compared to many I had had in BCN.
"Finally the seafood paella was just alright, very little seafood and what I thought was a small portion for two people."
"I have had better paellas in my home town of Miami,  Frankly we were a bit disappointed."
To make ammends the owner did treat us to a free 1/2 bottle of cava which we graciously accepted and drank.
The waitress recommended the house wine and it was excellent especially for the price 10E.
"Overall, the setting made it a nice place but the are many others in the same area that I'll try the next time."
I loved this restaurant!
It was a short walk from our hotel near Plaza Santa Ana and if I hadn't been handed a flyer earlier in the day I never wouldn't have known about this place because it's on a side street that doesn't have a lot of pedestrian traffic.
"Staff was very friendly, food and atmosphere were great (it's very cute and nicely decorated inside)."
No complaints whatsoever.
We tried several vegetarian restaurants in Madrid and this was our favorite.
"Like some of the other vegetarian restaurants, they offer two or three meat dishes too."
This is a very small but really excellent Italian restaurant in the Arguelles area.
"Staff spoke some English and were very happy to communicate in a mixture of English, Spanish and Italian."
"Excellent antipasti plates to share between two or three people, excellent pasta dishes and if they have it definitely try the carpaccio of pineapple with pistachio ice cream for dessert."
"Al Fresco possible with sea views - broad menu - diners represent all nationalities - food consistently good, staff and owners always excellent and interactive with customers."
Very well respected locally.
Recommend without hesitation
Wonderful food.
Large portions (order the half ration when available).
The service was prompt and very friendly.
Overall the best place we have eaten in town.
We went to La Solera for tapas after a recommendation from a friend who had recently been to Madrid.
It is an easy walk from the Sol metro station and felt distinctly Spanish.
The drinks were cheap and the tapas were tasty.
I loved the atmosphere and the looks of the inside.
"It was pretty empty when we arrived, around 8:30, but got busier as the night went on."
Highly recommended.
"If you are looking for something original to eat, that tastes very good, has the atmopsphere of a fancy eatery ( located by the way on a fancy street overlooking casa de campo park.)"
and will not rip your pockets i definitley recommend this place.
"After living in Germany for 8 months from Australia, we were really determined to get ourselves some good seafood in Barcelona."
"After 2 days of wandering (and wondering) around to look for decent seafood restaurant along Port Vell, we stumbled across this restaurant on our way to the Barceloneta beach."
The maitre'd politely offered to show us the menu and explained that their 2-people seafood platter is very good and very well priced.
"Well we didn't think much of what he said as we knew that all maitre'ds are trained to lure people into the restaurant, and there were just restaurant after restaurant along this stretch, so we knew these guys had to work hard to win customers."
But we did decide to go in.
We ordered the 2-people seafood platter and a half portion calamari rings for entree.
"The waitress then suggested if we would instead like to get the calamari rings (Calamar Romana) and the baby crayfish (Cigalas Plancha) as entrees, and half portion of the 2-people seafood platter (Parrillada)."
So that's what we ordered.
"The calamari rings were slightly oily but tasty and cooked just right, they weren't stringy."
"The crayfish were also good but I didn't enjoy it as much as it's quite troublesome to get the meat out, but it was still quite good."
Then the seafood platter came.
"I'm not kidding, it was literally a mound of seafood on a plate about 40x30cm in size."
"From the bottom of the stack there were about 20 mussels, 20 prawns, monkfish, hake fillet, a huge slab of cuttlefish and a decent size crayfish."
"We thought they might have made a mistake and gave us the 2-people portion, but the bill showed that it was really the half portion."
"It was nicely cooked too - simple, nothing fancy cooking - but delicious, especially one of the fish steaks had really nice lemon herbs sauce."
"We only ordered seafood, without any potatoes or rice on the side."
We couldn't finish it.
In the end we paid: €4.95 for the half calamari rings platter (1/2 Calamar Romana) €21.95 for the half baby crayfish platter (1/2 Cigalas Plancha) €19.87 for the half seafood platter (1/2 Parrillada) which we thought was very very good price - discounting the crayfish platter which we thought was a lot more expensive than expected for 8-10 baby crayfish halves.
It was nice but not worth the price.
And why bother when you can get so much more with the seafood platter and pay less?
We have no hesitation to recommend this restaurant to other fellow travelers whatsoever.
We ourselves will definitely come back to this restaurant if we go to Barcelona again.
"Except we won't get the baby crayfish platter, as the other two items would satisfy our gluttons for seafood just fine."
They also serve paellas and non-seafood items.
"The maitre'd spoke good English but the waitress seemed to struggle a bit and she seemed somewhat impatient as we were having a difficult time deciding what to order, but she did help by giving us a recommendation."
Drinks in Barcelona everywhere is expensive.
Expect to pay about €4 for 0.5l beer and even softdrinks cost about the same.
The restaurant was highly recommended in Rick Steves' guide so we gave it a try and were not disappointed.
The daily lunch special was a great value and the food was very good.
Excellent wine selection.
"Restaurants like this are much of a muchness, there are two of them on this strip."
"Unfortunately, the disdain they have for their customers is a solid gold reason to avoid the place."
"They give you the friendly-friendly patter while trying to upsell you extras that aren't on the menu, and so you only have their word for the price."
"We had a plate of fried fish for 6 euros (fried whitebait or boquerones should be piping hot fresh from the oil, these were limp and lukewarm, and got left) to accompany the quick beers we'd come in for, but they charged us 8 euros for them, the waiter who told us 6 having conveniently disappeared."
"It took 10 minutes to find him, then he claimed the 2 euros was IVA (VAT, tax)."
"When I pointed out that tax in Spain is not 25% he recalculated and returned the bill, which upon closer inspection, actually clearly stated that tax was included in the 6 euros in the first place - but the bill was still more, so according to his own logic, we were being taxed twice."
Petty?
Confused?
That's how and what we were meant to feel.
"I told him in Spanish that for a euro or so I couldn't be bothered wasting more of my time arguing, but that he was a disgrace and that I was upset at being ripped off."
He didn't show any shame at being rumbled.
"I should have insisted on my money back but, understandably in a group of people on holiday, one of our party just wanted to ""leave it""."
So I was led to having to post a review online for posterity's sake.
"This kind of thing happens far, far too often in tourist areas in Spain, and is simply theft."
So all I can advise is that you avoid this restaurant.
"Instead, try the Toc De Mar next door: OK food, nice staff, no rip-off."
We ate there several times and the place grew on us every time.
"(Bizarrely, something made me suspect they are under the same ownership, but whatever, the management and staff next door are a different breed by far.)"
"Some dishes were good, a few a little bland."
Expected better food.
Wine was great and the service was impeccable.
Probably wont go back.
A little expensive for the quality of food served.
"It started of good enough...... we arrived and were led into a little hut like building , which had a couple of tables and a bar."
We ordered our drinks and were given a menu.
"As we were deciding what to order, the waitress appeared with a small pail of pebbles and a pot of mayonaisse for each of us."
It transpired that the pebbles on the top were infact potatoes.
Very cleverly done.
You are given a choice of menus....we decided on the 11 course one....only problem being that my husband is allergic to fish...that was no problem here...they said that they would adjust the menu to suit my husbands needs.
The first course was carpaccio.....i wont ruin the surprise here....but it was very cheeky!!!
"After this we were presented with our menus, with husbands being done differently....very impressive to have typed it up so quickly and amended to suit his needs."
Unfortunately it went down hill from here on....
I dont want to be too cruel about the food....but we felt that it was food as a concept rather than food to be eaten.
Imagine dishwater flavoured with the essense of lavender decorated with a sprig of rosemary.
"Thats being too cruel really, you can see that a hell of a lot of work has gone into each and every element of the dish....but somehow it didnt quite work for us."
My worse dish was the Fossilzed Salsify with Algues Top finished in a briny roe.
The problem being that it was extremely chewy and dare I say.....tasteless.
One thing I cannot fault was the service......second to none.
These people have been trained to a high standard and knew every dish that they bought to our table.
The whole experience lasted 4 hours......yes.....4 hours!!!
Is it worth going?
Yes... but only for the experience and not the food.
Total cost of the evening was 370 Euros
Everything was great.
I had the spinach tarta with parmesan cheese and verduras al curry.
"I agree with a previous reviewer, they have the best tiramisu!"
We had it two days in a row.
"Visited Cafe Gijon with my girlfriend, on the hope that the food would equal its notorious reputation as a cafe for the Spanish 'Literati' and bring a special feel to our meal."
We were desperately disappointed.
"If you think it would be equal to the Cafe Royal in London, equally a rendevous for the British ' Literati,' then think again."
The food had no comparison.
"Gijon's food was outragously expensive, and it's quality extremely poor."
You would be better off eating Tapas in its umbrella covered street area if you value your pocket.
"I ordered Gambas al Plancha for a starter, at some €27 and received eight half cooked, barely grilled prawns."
"For my second course, again well over €20, I ordered Meatballs."
And that was what you had.
"No vegetables at all, just balls and sauce."
"I know that Spanish home cooking would probably serve this just as it came, but come on, this is supposed to be a premier eatery."
"Advise: Just don't eat a full meal there, have some tapas, soak in the atmosphere, and go."
You'll leave the place with a much better memory.
It's really sad - the decent restaurants in Barcelona mostly feature really awful service.
The Agut is not an exception.
"It started with the statement that you can either dine at 8.30 or 10 - this cruise-like organization pattern shows already that the customer is a mere wheel in a well-oiled machine, but not the cherished center of attention."
We were rushed through dinner - although we chose the late seating on a Saturday night where they should expect people wanting to stay a little longer - as if we were at a New York diner.
The french couple next to us was even served the main course while still chewing on the last mouthful of the starter.
"For the first time in my life, I also encountered the long thought forgotten behaviour that two women are not treated equally like a mixed-sex couple."
"We had to fight for the attention of the waiter and when he served our bottle of wine, he filled both our glasses and THEN gestured to one of us to try it...  Our waiter showed the diligence of a street cleaner - very busy and productive, but he had not the slightest idea what his job was about."
He treated his guests in a very rough manner .
"In a place like this, I would also expect at least some knowledge of the English language."
At least he dimmed the AC a bit so we could take of our coats.
"Given these circumstances, the food couldn't rescue the situation."
It was ok - just ok. That's sad given the price level.
The Jamon Iberico as starter was quite greasy and tasted like it had been cut some hours ago.
"The tuna for main course was excellent, but was served without any side dishes and on a cold plate so it got cold pretty soon."
And the passion fruit pastry would have been tasteless without the mango coulis coming with it.
Super place for tapas and other light dishes.
Hard to get a table at night.
Enjoyed Chefs taster menu 26euro on 27/4/09 very much.
"This is the best restaurante in Seville and not the most expensive, well worth a taxi if its location between south of ALAMEDA DE HERCULES and the river is a challenge."
"Michelin standard food, very professional service, though little english spoken."
Defenetly one of the best atmospehric restaurant i have been visit.
I found this restaurant on Tripadvisor and decided to book it for one of our nights in Marbella.
"I don't have particularly high hopes for any restaurant when I go on holiday, but Messina surpassed every hope - the restaurant was sophisticatedly cool, the staff were amazingly professional and the food was truly a work of art with some very imaginative touches."
"I loved the welcome glass of cava, the litle plate of amuse bouches, and the three courses we chose were out of this world!"
"We loved Messina so much, we went back again....can't wait to return!"
Great little gem in Marbella - don't miss out!
"Inexpensive, quick service and gaspacho japones??"
!
one of my favorites in barcelona!!!
chech it out...
Very good Asturian (north of Spain) food.
Visited last month and was very impressed.
Fab food and very friendly staff.
Will definitely return.
"On our yearly trip to Mijas Costa,we always drop in to this restaurant, we have never had a bad meal here,we have got to know the family who run this restaurant,they give best quality food at a realistic price,thats why we keep going back"
Been there many times with my family really good food and great atmosphere dont forget to try the Duck or Liver excellent its definitely the Italian i will be visiting when i go also reasonable prices
We stopped at La Llagosata almost by chance - and were very glad we did.
It looked like all the other restaurants lining the small bay at Llanfranc and we weren't expecting more than just an OK lunch.
Instead we had a really delicious meal.
Wonderful gazpacho with an unusual touch: a ball of excellent gazpacho ice cream in it (which was subtly different in flavour).
"Eveything else was great too, particularly a wonderful Tarte Tatin wuth cinamon ice cream."
I've eaten much inferior food at places twice the price and far more pretentious.
This place is great and (at least for us) a real find.
"(By the way, this restaurant is on the coast, at Lanfranc; not in or close to Girona (which another post says.)"
"I dont agree with the last review, we have been to villa paradiso many times in the past but the last time we went we had very bad service, so we wont be returning."
"There were four of us and they brought 3 meals out, and forgot about the 4th one, no apologies, but by the time they bought the last one out, we had all finished."
"Then I discovered that the last bit of my chicken was raw, so I mentioned it to the waiter and he just took it away, again with no apology."
"The food used to excellent, but that really put us  off and we wont be returning."
"Cunini, as well as another seafood bar was recommended to us by a food-loving local."
"The food was absolutely DELICIOUS, we ordered almost all of the seafood section, and ended up with a 250$ bill, it was all worth it."
"We first started by the ""almejas"" the clams with the marinara sauce."
It was a delicious start.
"The bread was really stale, even though we were the first table to be served."
We sat right when the rest.
opened its doors so we expected the bread to be fresh but it wasn't.
"We also ordered the Cigalas ""crayfish"" or langoustines, my boyfriend went crazy with them."
They were perfectly cooked.
"We also had the sole whole fish, it came with a veggies side, it was perfect as well."
The Marques de Rascal white wine was a great compliment to the food.
"The only downside was the REALLY rude waiter, he had an attitude and wasn't at all helpful in explaining the menu."
It's a MUST go spot
While the food was quite good and the service generally excellent I will remember this restaurant for the rather strange waiter who was trying to push everyone in the place into ordering his selected wines.
You waited for the next couple to come in so that his attention would turn from you to them.
Fortunately it was a fairly busy place and he moved on quite quickly.
Good food at a fair price.
"We discovered the ""Orange Tree"" restaurant a few years ago and have dined there at least once on every visit to Marbella."
"The location, just off Orange Square, is great."
The atmosphere is lively and the staff friendly.
The menu offers a range of four or five choices on each course.
The food is interesting and beautifully prepared and presented.
We have always found the staff friendly.
"The restaurant can get very busy in the summer and it is advisable to book a table, preferably outside."
This is the best place to go for dinner in town.
Specially in winter time when the game is available.
Very good starters and excent desserts.
Nice location and espectacular cellar Good price for quality
Went here following a recommedation.
We both had steak which was lovely but it took just short of an hour for it to arrive.
The restaurant was not that busy and it just seemed that the staff were totally clueless as to the orders coming in and there was confusion in their faces.
"Went 3 times last June, 3 times this June."
"All food has been excellent, with friendly staff."
"Most food types covered, from meat to fish to pasta to pizza to local specialities, all nicely presented."
"Good views of the sea & the promenade, as Grill Faro is on the corner they have better sunset views than some of the other restaurants on Faro Boulevard."
"Prices in line with the other restaurants in the Faro Boulevard promenade centre, around 80 euros for 3 course meal for two with a couple of alcoholic drinks each."
One of the few places that consistently remembered my requests for no ice or lemon in my drinks.
"Was sorry to hear about the previous reviewer's experience, my partner and I have both thoroughly enjoyed steaks here and have never had an excessive wait for food, drink or the bill."
"The Look Fu restaurant: The food is an absolute rubbish, so bad."
I had diarrhea for two days after eating there.
"And very, very expensive!, and the only thing the waiter did well was smiling."
"Too much sauce and no meat in it, and have you realized that there are no cats in the street?..."
ohh!
that's so strange.
I'll never be back there.
"Pont Vell has a balcony that boasts an absolutely stunning view, overlooking a medieval bridge and a beautiful river."
"We were serenaded by the song of frogs throughout our dinner, which was wonderful!"
"The interior of Pont Vell is also gorgeous, as one feels that he is descending into a hidden and cozy lair as one enters the main dining room."
"Overall, it was lovely both inside and out, although on a summer's evening it would be hard to imagine anywhere more romantic or beautiful than the terrace."
"Our food was exquisite, to complement the gorgeous setting."
"We had appetizers of pate, mushrooms in a delectable sauce, and the reknowned jamon serrano."
"All were fantastic, especially the pate."
"My main course was a succulent duck breast, which was cooked to perfection."
"My companions had the tuna and the trout, and both were also extremely satisfied."
"Topped off with excellent wine and great, friendly service, it was a meal fit for kings."
I strongly recommend Pont Vell based on my experience there and hope to return soon myself!
This restaurant is one of a host of places offering 'tourist style' international cuisine overlooking the square in Soller.
"A great square, lovely location and aspect but a terrible and overpriced restaurant."
"My wife had fresh grilled sardines - 4 of them, with a small salad and priced at almost £15!!!"
I had the 'meat steak on stone' - it was processed meat in a packet gravy sauce with some tinned carrots on top and (frozen bagged?)
potato croqeuts on the side.
One mouthful and I handed it back - I didn't ask to try anything else from the menu.
The waitress spent most of her time with a young child on her hip and chatting to sisters.
The only positive was that they didn't try to charge me - but overall a terrible restaurant.
I felt like warning other holidaymakers away from the place when I walked past on following nights.
"This restaurant is more expensive than many others in Denia, but I assure You it is well worth it."
the food is just better and so is the attention to details.
"Service is friendly although a bit stuffy, but the food..... Soooo good!"
I've been to the restaurant at least ten times and never been disappointed!
"This is not a great restaurant, and again it's glorifying the name of restaurant."
Totally mixed experience.
I'm not sure that i would call this a restaurant.
More like a bar that sells food!
A very extensive wine menu which is great.
"We had a selection of around 6 different tapas all of which were nice but it has to be said, a little pricey!"
If you want to come out full and feeling as if you have had a proper meal (maybe 8 tapas between 2 of you and a bottle of wine) it could come to around 60euro i suppose.
I still think we would go back.
"I have only given 3 stars, there was just something about the place that felt a bit too formal and forced."
This 'restaurant' is currently at the top of the list with trip advisor.
I have noted that all the rave reviews seem to be from one time posters.
Make what you will of this.
We had been traveling for 22 hours and we were hungry and tired.
We arrived at our hotel late in the evening and asked for suggestions were we might eat.
Sebastian Restaurant was right around the corner from the hotel and gave us our first look at the charming ancient city of Hondarribia.
We stepped through the door and knew we had truly arrived in Basque country.
The decor was lovely and comfortable with a quiet ambiance that helped us to relax and unwind.
"Then the 4 course prix fixe  dinner began to arrive and we were fed the most interesting, delicious food; well prepared and beautifully served."
The wine they suggested was local and outstanding.
What a wonderful ending to a long day.
Found the place with ease because of TripAdvisor review.
It's on the street parallel to the Picasso Museum.
"We went for lunch, promptly at 1:30 (we were starving after doing the Museum in the morning)."
Montiel is simply lovely.
Comfortable and unassuming.
Intimate.
"The food was excellent, and the service very, very attentive."
The suggested wine added 17 euros.
It was superb and we took back to our hotel what remained in the bottle.
"Since Montiel is listed as being opened daily, save it for a Sunday or Monday when many restaurants are closed."
Highly recommended for Catalan cuisine.
Marcos is a terrific host and we enjoyed a wonderful meal in his quaint little restaurant.
He told us they plan to move to larger premises nearby later this year and he and his partners deserve every success.
We passed this restaurant during its siesta in early June 2009- made a booking in passing as it was our first night in Barcelona and literally 10m from the entrance (4 floors!)
"We booked - this place definately has the WOW factor - the quality of the food was tremendous and the (Argentinian) part owner (who had a very good knowlwdge of lacal and international wines - even had a wine on hand from one of our ""native"" South Africans producing win in Catalonia ) Both he and his and attendant were attentative and contributed significantly to our most enjoyable experience of the city - they set the grade for other restaurant visits and were certainly NOT surpassed - this was our best meaL in 10 days of ferreting out good dining in Barcelona The restaurant is relatively small (we only saw the ground floor area- perhaps 20 op on GF ) although the upstairs seemed to attract an ongoing flow ow elegant locals (Sat night?)"
- we would probably try a booking upstairs next time.
Prices are all relative - but in the Barcelona cobntext - Value was excellent for the quality.
"We arrived at the early hour of 20:30 (most seem to arrive @ 22:00 - 22:30 on Sat) we had some dedicated time with the attendants and an initiation into Catalan cuisine which greatly contributed to our very positive experience Our only regret is that we tried a number of other restauarants , same prices but significantly inferior quality of cuisine and service - we ran out of time to return."
perhaps on our next visit !!
08003 Barcelona Spain [--]
We didn't make any reservations but took a chance after reading the reviews on TA and showed up when they opened at 8pm (Friday).
We lucked out and they were able to fit us in.
The restaurant is on a small lane surrounded by small independently owned shops (artsy area) selling clothes and art.
The restaurant itself is very romantic and intimate.
The food was so fresh and delicious.
My husband was raving the whole night how amazing the food was.
We can honestly say that this was the BEST meal we had in our 10 day London/BCN trip.
Service was impeccable!
Highly recommended!
We (group of 6) including 3 vegetarians were fortunate enough to have stumbled across this little restaurant around 10pm Sunday night because the original restaurant we planned to visit was closed.
We took one look at the menu at Montrel and all agreed the selection of food looked intriguing enough to warrant an enquiry.
"We almost decided not to stay after some discussion was held amongst the group about the vegetarian options but that was until the charm of the waiter convinced us otherwise, kindly suggesting that they could make veggie versions of meals that contained fish or meat."
"We failed to catch the waiters name but judging by the other review listed here on TA it sounds like the waiter we had was the same person, Marcus."
I have to say that he was without a doubt the best waiter I have ever come across in any restaurant.
He was very friendly and helpful to the point that we all immediately felt relaxed about how good this experience was going to be.
Marcus helped us with our selection of red and white wines and explained in great detail about how the wine was produced and its flavours.
Both bottles of wine were outstanding and very reasonably priced too.
All our starters and mains were absolutely delicious and we could not fault any of it.
"Even though we managed to fill ourselves up there had to be room for dessert, if you ever have the privilege of visiting this awesome restaurant and still have the room in your tum - make sure you try the chocolate mousse ‘absolute heaven’ If you are in Barcelona and are looking for something other than traditional tapas and wish for that perfect meal then this place is a must."
I would happily return to Montrel in a flash and can only wish that more restaurants around the world supplied the level of service and quality of food and drink that you get at Montrel.
If there was ever a Michelin star for all round quality then this place certainly deserves one.
The restaurant is located in the great quaint gothic area.
"You could stumble on it, but with all the little shops, best to know where it is."
"We arrived while they were closed, we stopped inside to ask if they would let us make a reservation and were greated with smiles and warm welcome."
We made our reservation and headed out for a glass of wine.
"Back to the restaurant for our reservation, we were greeted again warmly."
"We asked for a suggestion for a bottle of red wine, they did not disappoint."
One of the appetizer specials was fresh shrimp...FRESH from the sea!
lightly sprinkled salt and pepper with olive oil completed it.
It was sensational.
"Followed closely behind by one of our new favorites, tomato brushed bread."
"They brought out fresh toasted bread, garlic cloves, tomatos and olive oil."
One of the staff showed us the correct way to make the bread.
WOW!
it was excellent!
"We ordered two entree's, pork and tuna."
Both entree's were brought out and were mouth watering.
The tuna was lightly glazed with a crushed black olive topping (and I don't like black olives) that was out of this world good.
The pork melted in your mouth.
"We couldn't stop there, we went on for dessert and a dessert wine."
"Again, all extraordinary."
Super romantic too!
We will go there when we go back...EVERYTIME.
The entire meal the staff was outstanding and beyond friendly.
Great people for sure.
My wife and I ate here after reading many restaurant reviews for Barcelona.
We weren't disappointed.
"The food was great, but more importantly, the service provided by Marcos, our waiter and restaurant owner, was fantastic."
"He patiently helped us choose a perfect wine for our meals, recommending a great wine for around 15 euros."
He appears to genuinely care for his customers.
I would return to Montiel on my next trip to Barcelona.
"It´s open on Sunday, that´s the best point, because only a few restaurants in Barcelona are open on Sundays."
"We were siting on the table close to the main door, that was open all night and it was too noisy and windy."
We chose the tasting menu.
The foie gras terrine was raw.
"The tuna was finished, and the waiter came to the table with grilled cod without telling us in advance."
"My wife doesn´t like cod , and she asked for somethig different."
Then the maitre returned her plate to the kitchen to change it and left my cod on the table getting cold because I didn´t want to start without her.
Pork filet was overcooked.
Dessert was very simple just a ball of ice cream with strawberry consome.
Price is not expensive but I preffer to pay a little bit more and have a great experience.
We visited twice-17 and 19 June 2009.
"Not easy to find but well worth the effort First, I advise that you book."
"Its very popular and that's not surprising, given the excellent food, service and value."
"Its worth trying the taster option-half portions of two starters, two mains and two deserts, all very good."
Marcos is very helpful with choice of food and drinK.
We will return one day I hope.
"We had been planning to visit this restaurant after reading about it on this site, but we only manged to do it on the very last night."
Now we are all planning to visit it again the next time we are coming to Barcelona!
"The food was lovelyg, the wine superb, the service impeccable."
Cheers to my new family Cheryl and Paul for taking my wife and myself there.
"The service was good, the choice was good."
"The Ox steak is out of this world, but not for small eaters!"
the shouder of lamb is also not for the faint hearted.
The menu is written in three languages!
and the staff seem to be fluent in all three!
"I had 100% support from the staff ,and help with my totally useless Spanish."
Well done and Bonne apetite.
( I said my Spanish was terrible!)
In the midst of what we thought the ultimate of grim towns (personal taste) we found Villa Mercedes-whilst we thought expensive the food was delicious a very cool band played unobtrusively and the service very good-defintley recommend a visit
Great combination of Spanish and Asian cooking and quite cheap for what you get.
"A Potemkin Village is something hollow, fake, which was built temporarily to give a false positive impression."
"""Asadito"" is the Potemkin Village of Argentinian restaurants on Mallorca."
"Impresive-looking, 2-story building, with flaming gas fountains in the outdoor seating area, quite spectacular at night."
"However, it's all superficial."
"There is no seating to speak of, on the top floor."
"Almost looks like one of those Potemkin They do use genuine ""Quebracho"" (Ironwood) from Argentina charcoal to grill the meats."
"However, we thought it was pricey and the quality was just not there."
"Everything is a la carte, everything."
"If you want to just have drinks and snacks, you are not allowed to sit outside."
"Steaks we ordered were small, and for a simple, very modest meal (no appetizers, no desserts, a few beers) was well over 100 Euros for 4 people."
"My advice, go elsewhere, such as to ""Ca'n Curro"" which is in the Poligono Son Oms, next to the Airport."
Another choice closer by is Ca'n Torrat.
But If you dine here you will be certainly disappointed.
"If dining out is as much a part of your holiday as cultured visits, you must try this restaurant."
"Ruta del Veleta is situated just outside Granada, a 10 Euros taxi ride each way."
"Modern interesting cuisine, highly professional staff and a feast of antique and modern decoration."
The staff will take you round the various rooms if they have time.
Save this restaurant for that special occasion and you wont be disappointed.
"Lovely restaurant, recommended by locals.Menu varied and great choices.Suckling pig and fish excellent,well worth a visit.Service very good.!"
Its the best restaurant overlooking the harbour and not the most expensive.Good value for such superb food and service.
I guess I do now.
My hosts insisted that this place was great and boy were they right.
"I don't know why I was any more surprised to have great Chinese food in Barcelona than I am in San Francisco or London, but I was."
From start to finish the waiters kept brining out impressive dish after dish for the 8 of us.
"Our host, who is a frequent guest here, gave the waiter carte blanche to bring out dishes after explaining he had guests from California who really knew their Chinese food."
"We had abalone, langostino in fried noodles, prawns, duck, duck noodles, California roll, fried cabbage, kim chee soup, Shangai noodles, beef kung pao, salt & pepper lobster, garlic lobster, friend scallops and roast pork noodles..."
"The meal was FABULOUS, I can't wait to go back and I will be sure to take my host out because he knew the tricks to getting the best out of this restaurant."
We tried several high end restaurants in Barcelona.
Cinc Sentits was the best of them all.
"Very innovative and tasty food, great service, nice decor."
It really deserves its Michelin Star.
"If you only have one blow out meal whilst you're in Barcelona, make sure it's at Cinc Sentits."
Without a doubt the best meal I've ever had in my life.
My boyfriend and I returned here for the second time a few weeks ago.
Last time we came it did not have a Michelin star but now it finally has the accolade that it deserves.
We both had the six course Sensacions Tasting Menu with the Special Wine Pairing and it was worth every penny.
Cooking of the highest standard and service to match.
The atmosphere is of elegance but it is not at all stuffy and the staff are faultless.
We will definitely eat here every time we come to Barcelona.
"Excellent starters, pasta and piadine for low prices."
Good service in a stylish nice little spot.
My wife and I just got back from a one week vacation in Barcelona.
"I selected this restaurant after reading some of the favorable reviews, but I guess either the favorable reviewers or I went to a different restaurant."
"I took two of the premier tasting menus with wine pairings, so that if the meal was bad is wouldn't be because of me."
"The cost is very expensive, which is somewhat understandable because the restaurant does not have many tables, as well as the ""complicated"" wine pairings as explained by the waiter."
The service was amateurish compared to some of the other restaurants we dined at.
And the food...ugh the food... was very disappointing.
"Further, the portions were so small that you could barely get the flavor of what was being presented."
"I don't think it is appropriate to mention other restaurants in this review, but you can certainly do a lot, lot better, both in food and service, and spend a lot less money."
We will certainly skip this restaurant when we return to Barcelona.
"However, there are three restaurants we will certainly go back to."
Went to this restaurant with my wife in may 2009 after reading about it in the 2009 Michelin guide and had one of my greatest food-experiences ever.
"Friendly, attentive and skilled service."
"Innovative, tasty and beautiful food."
Minimalist style of both cooking and interior.
"The wine pairing, I'm afraid, is a complete rip-off."
The pours were so small I was embarrassed for the restaurant.
"The food is fine, although a bit overrated."
"I've eaten at over 100 restaurants in Barcelona, and while this one is very consistent on food quality, the 50 euro wine pairing was so smugly delivered and stingily offered that it all left me with a pretty bad taste in my mouth."
I really loved this place and would love it was in my own city.
The salad and pasta was really top-notch.
Went to Bodega two nights whilst in Lanzarote and got fantastic food both nights.
The chicken croquettes are perfect as a starter and I'd recommend the chicken kebab or the wok fried fillet steak for mains.
Definitely would go again.
Service was crap and the food wasn't great.At the end of the day that's only our opinion!
We just happened to pass this restaurant with outside seating.
"There was a short wait to get a table, but the tapas looked good."
"The waiter spoke little English, but suggested we order the spicy potatoes that came with both a red & a mayonnaise-type spicy sauce...very tasty."
We ordered the tomato bread & what we thought were sausages was more like a hard salami...good too!
We each had a glass of wine.
"The total for our tapas & wine was 17,35e without tip."
Rambla Catalunya is similar to Las Ramblas although not as pedestrian friendly.
Lots of better tapas to be had in Barcelona.
It's a kind of cute place but the tapas are pricey and not great.
We stumbled across this place on our first night in Barcelona.
I am so glad we did because this will go on our list for next time.
It was one of the best meals we had on our trip!
"Sensi is a small, but quaint little restaurant with great food, wine and service."
"It is relatively easy to find which if you have been to Barca you know finding restaurants in all the alleys is a challenge, but part of the fun."
lol :) I had two appetizers that were divine- the first was an aubergine with the shrimp and mushrooms yum!!
The second was one of their salads with the bacon and it was delicious too!!
My husband tried the lamb with the curry sauce and it was fantastic.
Our friend had the pasta with clams and he said it was very good.
The host and server was really friendly and he even gave us great advice about the music scene in Barca.
Overall great experience and we will go back.
From the moment we stepped in to the restaurant we recieved good service.
The staff was friendly and fast to get us seated.
The plaza seating outside made for a relaxing evening meal.
"For starters we had the grilled shrimp, fried calamari, and jamon serrano."
The wait time for the appetizers was 10 - 15 min.
"not bad at all, just enough time to enjoy a glass of wine before the meal."
The food was great and plentiful; we also ordered seafood paella that was very tasty.
"The rice wasn't under or over cooked, the seafood was very fresh (great mussels)."
"Overall I will have to say that my wife and I enjoyed our meal and relaxing atmosphere at ""La Cueva""."
"Friendly family run restaurant, very welcoming and with good local food at reasonable prices."
"English spoken, as are several other languages."
The local wines are well represented and the whites are particularly good.
"we has a very nice dinner under the orange trees,the paella was delicious, the waiter was friendly to us."
we had a very romantic evening in seville in this beautifull place a night to remenber.
I cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this restaurant.
"My wife and I are here on our honeymoon, and were interested in finding a great somewhat hidden spot, and this was our place."
We went on a monday night at about 8:30 PM and did not have to wait for a table.
"The food was so delicately prepared, everything seemed to be in just the right place."
Honestly our meals from start to finish were just incredible.
"Eat bite was followed by a long, ummm, yummm, ahhh."
That good!
And thats not even including the desert!
Wow get the strawberry sorbet with coconut creme.
"Also, the pricing is so reasonable, you really can't beat it."
"A little bit out of the way for some, but it was close to our hotel and we loved it."
Go check it out!
!
We called in here for an early evening meal hoping for an authentic paella and the menu appeared to show some tasty dishes.
"The meal that appeared was terrible - stodgy, salty, rice with 4 small prawns and a few peas - nothing at all like the photo on the menu."
We left half of the meal on the plate and when the waiter took the dishes he looked a little guilty but didn't ask whether the food was o.k.
or not.
I wouldn't eat here again even if there was nowhere else to eat.
"It's on Placa Reial, so it's a great location with street performers in front of you."
Paella wasn't bad.
The price was much cheaper than anywhere on Las Ramblas.
"On Tuesday 2nd June 2009 6 of us ""ate "" ( if you could call it that ) at this restaurant & 6 of us would never go back there again it was overpriced , rude waiters ."
and disgusting food .
Please do not go here
Good food at a reasonable price.
The two of us had a very good very large lunch with wine for about $40.
"I found the service to be friendly and while the atmosphere, at least if your inside and not on the terrace, is nothing special the food was a bargin given the quality."
Have you ever tried duck with chocolate?
Or cucumber ice cream?
Or maybe bacon creme?
This restaurant serves those artistic award-winning dishes that will confuse your sense of taste.
There is an indescribable surprise in every taste.
"And don't be taken aback with the food description, because it will exceed your expectations by miles."
"If you're still afraid, just ask for the best course and the waiter will help you."
€50 for a full-course (+€20 for wines) was really worth it.
Book your table in advance to ensure the fullest experience.
We try and visit Nerja every year on our own or with friends and always go to El Candil for a meal or two.
On every occasion we have been delighted with the friendly and curtious service and are always impressed with the cleanliness of the premises inside and out and the selection on the menu.
We have never been disappointed and are pleased to say that the change of ownership has not effected the service or quality of meals one jot.
The location of El Candil could not be better being just off the main square but with views to ''The Balcon de Europe'.
Booked a table for 9pm on a Sunday - it was full on Saturday night.
"Stylish interior, super Catalan food, excellent set menu (3 courses with wine for €19), good friendly service."
A la carte not expensive either.
Best value in Barcelona.
My family and friends love this restaurant.
Lots of great history in Ronda.
Food is well prepared.
"Pork, beef, wild game."
Kid friendly.
Gets lots of repeat business from people in Ronda.
Great service.
Good value.
Owners are well-liked.
What else are you looking for?
"In Chueca neighbourhood, don't forget to visit the restroom and to taste the margaritas!"
I dined on this restaurant in may 2009.
The food I enjoyed was outstanding.
I had the tasting menu and was amazed each time a new dish came in.
The one star this restaurant holds is well deserved.
Honor to the chef.
However the service can not even remotely match the quality of the food.
I found the servants arrogant.
When I go to a high end restaurant I expect the staff to be accommodating and to do what they can to make the visit an enjoyable experience.
In my opinion at least one of the staff members should be without delay sent back to restaurant school for a charm intensive.
Interestingly these were the only people I met during my stay in Andalusia that did not seem genuinely friendly.
For the sake of the food i would recommend it.
We've popped in here on a number of occasions for tapas/seafood.
It's in an odd location - tucked up a side-street between tacky clothes/souvenir shops - but it's an ideal stop-off if you're at the Poniente end of Benidorm.
"My daughter had her heart set on ensaladilla rusa and, although this wasn't on the menu, the owners rustled some up especially for her, which was greatly appreciated."
"My sardines were delicious - simply grilled with salt, lemon and parsley ."
"The croquetas, on the other hand, were obviously out of a packet and not as crispy as they could have been."
"The menu has plenty of budget dishes with the ubiquitous chips on the side to appeal to tourists, but during lunch the restaurant was filled with older local people having the (very reasonably priced) set menu."
"If you're on a budget, as we were, give it a go."
The C'an Pedro restaurant is a little out of town about a 5 minute walk but is worth it.
"The menu is wriiten on the chalk board so varies according to the produce bought on that day, but the owner is fluent in English and happy to translate and recommend the best dish of the day cooked by his wife."
There is terrace seating as well as indoors with its own carpark.
"We had tapas for starter, a fish and meat course with huge salad and two desserts, two glasses of wine with table water all for 30 euros and it was delicious."
Give it a go definately worth a look.
"We decided to have lunch in 'Piccola Italia' on our first day because we were tired and it was near our hotel, so it wasn't exactly on our list of choices."
The service was ok but when the waitress brought the beer it wasn't very cold.
"As for the food,well, I haven't got a lot to say about it , other than it tasted like frozen food to me."
"Next time I would spend more time looking for another place, no matter how tired I am."
"We ate here every other night, it was so good."
"Great food, very friendly and hospitable service, good house wine, reasonable prices."
Between the four of us we tried loads of different dishs and they were all fab!
Easy the best food on the Island.
Great menu with something for everyone.
Look for antable upstairs and enjoy the views over the harbour.
"Follow up your meal with a visit to Buddys bar, just around the corner."
"Fantastic music and athmosphere, with a free drink of your choice from Bodeco's."
Someone at the bar told me that Deco does a great job in the bar while Bo could do better in the restaurant but I have a feeling the opposite is true.
"Keep up the good work, Look after that drummer and we hope to see ye again SOON."
Up Ross
You know you're in the right place when everyone is speaking Catalan and the line is around the block.
An hour or so is nothing when the evening meal is part of the nightlife.
Waiting in line means hanging out and drinking.
"This establishment serves up amazingly fresh tapas--freshly made pan con tomate, fresh deep fried baby eels, fresh artichoke, and amazing raciones of catalan delights."
Wine flows cheaper than the local salty Vichy Catalan (sparkling water) and is a thousand times better than what we get here.
"You know when you're getting the real deal and this is it in Barcelona, along with Cal Pep."
This was such a great restaurant and I am so glad that we found it!
"We were surrounded by many locals speaking Catalan, so we took that as a sign that we had found a good place!"
"You can see the kitchen and watch dishes being prepared, which is fun."
"Every dish that we had was excellent, particularly the seafood tapas."
"Great atmosphere, great food."
"Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food."
Very funky little place - with great food.
Don't be afraid to get there early for dinner.
I think we (2 people) walked in at 8:30 and waited 5-10 mins to be seated at the bar - but the second we were seated there was a huge line up the stairs.
We asked for some recommendations and weren't let down.
Would definitely recommend.
"We stumbled upon this restaurant, and later found it as a recommended restaurant in our Frommer's book."
This is a delightful little place with a local feel.
As a vegetarian I often have trouble finding authentic food that I am able to try.
I found several vegetarian tapas including my favorites: potatas bravas (spicy potatoes) and pa amb tomaquet (toasted bread rubbed with tomato.)
I drank Cava (sparkling white wine) and enjoyed an amazing chocolate mousse dessert which was served with olive oil and sea salt.
Sounds different....but tastes unbelievable!
Went there because of all positive reviews.
"Place looks nice, but the food is just so so ."
Quite mediocre.
Seems like they have 'flatten' the dynamic taste of thai food for th egeneral public (?)
It's quite expensive and I certainly expected much more!
Just got back from Addaia in Menorca and had a lovely time.
Ate at the El Catillo restaurant on a few occasions and all of them were good.
The staff are excellent and the food is very well prepared and tasty.
Each night there is a different special - we had the fish and chips on the Wednesday and it was delicious- portions are huge.
We also had our breakfast there and this was also huge but very good.
Overall I would give this restaurant 10 out of 10
"We made the mistake of eating here during our first visit to Benidorm, as it wasn't far from our apartments."
"From the cannelloni and microwaved croquetas (both of which had to be sent back as they were cold in the middle) to the Scrooge-like desserts, it was a truly disappointing meal."
"Service was slow and indifferent, the restaurant dusty and dingy, the atmosphere gloomy and the portions meagre."
It proved to be the most costly and least enjoyable meal of the entire 2-week stay.
To be avoided.
"My husband, mum & dad & I LOVE the Monkey Bar, the food is amazing, the cocktails are great & the staff are very friendly, the service is 5 star."
Lunch or dinner its a chilled out trendy place to go & its right in the heart of Las Americas.
"My husband & I also visited the Beach Bar in Adeji the views are amazing & at night its the place to be for the younger generation, if your over 50 I dont think you'd like it as much as the one in Las Americas."
I would defo recommend anyone trying the Monkey Bar
"This restaurant was recommended by BCN table guide and so we decided to try it (apparently it was also featured in ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"")...my husband (who is fluent in 4 languages and somewhat conversational in Spanish as we live in Miami) called and made a reservation."
We arrived a few days later to be informed there was no reservation under our name.
They refused to seat us -- essentially accusing us of lying until my husband took out his cell phone and showed them their number.
"Of course, no apology."
Sat us right next to the kitchen instead of the main dining room or on the terrace as he had requested when he had called.
So we are all dressed up and not willing to let a bad start ruin our night we greeted our waiter with a smile and tried to proceed with ordering.
"Well, to make a long story short, this was the WORSE restaurant I ever been to and my husband and I eat out several times a week even while home."
"Both our waiters (one takes the order, the other delivers the food) were incredibly rude to us...we felt like livestock."
Our main waiter was clearly upset when we tried to ask about various foods on the menu...the plates (which weren't cheap...24 euros on average) were literally dumped on our table.
He NEVER once asked us if we needed anything or how we enjoyed the meal.
"Both of them looked like someone had just killed their family pet, although I honestly think they wouldn't have even cared."
"It got so bad, that I finally just lost it."
"I'm normally a very calm person, but I let loose on this guy AFTER we paid."
I don't think any one deserves to be treated this poorly -- you get better service at Burger King!
"He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, and walked away."
"Not one person (manager, supervisor, etc.)"
approached us to ask what was wrong.
"So, if you want to spend A LOT of money for mediocre food and enjoy being treated like you are worthless, then this is your place!"
"Otherwise, I don't think they deserve your business or your hard earned money."
"Otherwise, you HAVE TO eat here."
It is so absolutely amazing.
"We booked the underground table, at the original site of the restaurant."
We were warped back to the 16th century Madrid.
"We were warned not to take the appetizer (even though baby eels sound so appealing), and we were right."
When the suckling pig arrived it was a huge serving!
"I had the ribs and my friend had the legs, and both of us were zapped to heaven."
The desserts were also awesome.
We had flan and macarpone ice cream.
It was the best.
I would really like to go back when I visit Madrid next time.
We tried The Botin Experience which the restaurant offers every lunchtime weekdays at 12.30.
"It costs €55 per person and includes a tour of the restaurant, a lunch and a gift when you leave."
We had the guided tour of the restaurant to ourselves.
It made a difference eating there once we knew more about its history.
We could choose where we wanted to sit for the taster menu lunch which was very good.
We felt well looked after.
It was definitely worth the €55 per person.
They also gave us a ceramic pitcher when we left as a keepsake.
Any restaurant in Madrid that is relatively full at 8:00 pm is likely full of tourists and Botin was turning people when we arrived at 8:30.
Being a Hemingway fan I was determined to dine at Botin at least once and while having had the experience I would not return soon I did enjoy the evening.
The service was good and and food fine - I had both far better and far worse roast sucking pig at other places during my three weeks in Spain.
The wine actually surprised me as I thought it was good and complemented the meal something I did not expect.
Given the history of the place I was surprised the food was a good as it was and that it was not more expensive.
You can certainly find better food in Madrid for less but Botin is good and if your a Hemingway fan worth an try.
This little bar/cafe is great for a snack in the daytime and does the best steak and onion rolls on the costa.
San Miguel is only 1 euro a bottle and the service is quick and friendly.
The only downside is they stop serving food after 6.
There is one reason and one reason only that you should go to el botin's- it's an amazing tourist trap!
and an awesome one too!
"I usually run away from tourist traps- but heck, if they're makin roasted suckling pigs, the best gaspacho in town, and some of the best waiters u'll ever meet (ignore everyone else- they were really cool)- then HECK i'm going!"
OH and who cares that your probably going to end up bankrupt or divorced after you pay the bill- it'll be worth it!
"Now here's the thing- everyone will tell you that you need to get the roast suckling pig, which is what they're famous for, but don't feel like you're forced to."
One of my friends decided he was going to get a steak and once i saw that thing i immediately regretted my roast suckling pig.
"I mean it was a good pig, but that steak was probably the best thing i've ever tasted."
"So here's my advice- get some money, reserve a spot in the wine cellar, accept your fate as a moronic money-spending tourist, and stuff yourself sinfully!"
Botin is the worst restaurant I ate in during this trip to Madrid.
Why?
The cuchinillo is over-priced.
Our waiter was very unfriendly until we gave him a 20% tip.
"They just claim to be oldest restaurant in the world,by Guiness records."
that's all.
"Better spend your money in other more satisfying restuarants, like La Barraca, El Caldero, Gregorio III Restaurant and Cerveceria Alemana."
"But if you really want to eat in Botin, just try it once and pay the price and learn your lesson."
We loved our meal here.
I'm surprised by the negative reviews.
The paella was the best we had in Spain and the seafood bisque soup was delicious.
Wonderful service.
It's expensive but worth it.
"After having tried almost every restaurant, the best restaurant in Ronda is definitely Carmen la de Ronda, Plaza Duquesa de Parcent 10 (www.carmenladeronda.com)."
"This restaurant where locals eat serves typical food from the region, yet in a more refined way than is common in most restaurants."
"The menu is elaborated but not too, and lovely waitress Lourdes will be happy to recommend specialties."
"You would nomally start with a salad to share, and continue with a main and desert."
"An average 3 course dinner with drinks would cost around 25 € per person, which is a lot less than the overrated and overpriced Tragabuches restaurant."
"Moreover, this restaurant is beautifully located on a little square with high trees."
Truly a hidden gem.
A pretty restaurant with so-so fairly priced food.
I can't say anything particurly negative but if your only in town a day or two and want something special you may want to look elsewhere.
it was the best meal we have had in a long time service was great food fantastic would tell all my friends about it
"We ate here during our Moraira trip, the pizza was fabulous but the service was AWFUL."
There was no childrens menu so i thought they would at least make a smaller pizza for our 4 year old but they refused.
This is my wife's favorite restaurant in Barcelona and one of my favorites.
It is associated with a culinary school that is operated by the owner.
"The atmosphere is elegant, the service is very helpful, friendly, and professional, and the food is very, very good."
The dining experience is memorable and will cause you to return again and again.
Food was excellent and atmosphere in the Boqueria cannot be matched!
"I would definitely recommend it to anyone for both the great, freshly prepared food and the experience/atmosphere!"
Returned recently from a mini break to Moraira & just had to comment on this awesome establishment !!!
I have eaten in many fine restaurants over the years but the quality of food & attention to detail at Del Mar cannot be beaten in my opinion....If you were to ask me to name a favourite it would be the Monkfish wrapped in Pancetta ; but then WE LOVE IT ALL!!!
Everything is FRESHLY PREPARED while you relax with a Cava or three taking in the sights & ambience of this little piece of Heaven on Earth...Go there ; try it...Rob from Littlehampton England HIGHLY RECCOMMENDS IT!!!
You will not be disappointed.
Well done to all @ Del Mar & I will be back soon !!
!
"I did the research, read reviews and decided this would be a nice place to take clients while in Madrid."
I was wrong.
Food was barely acceptable.
I would compare it to airplane food.
"We gave them a chance--ordered appetizers, entrees and desert and each of us had something different but unfortunately we were disapointed on every level starting with the stale bread."
"Even the hamburger, ""their specialty"" was bad."
How do you screw up a hamburger????
"American owner and her German boyfriend served us personally, found them unusually snotty, all things considered."
Every other meal in Madrid was great so don't waste your time or money here (not cheap).
Suggest going down to Latina district or Cava Baja street.
Had a great meal at La Posada de la Villa.
Great service and atmosphere.
"We ate here on Saturday night for the first time, although the service was fine and the food well presented, the freshness left a lot to be desired especially of a piece of beef that I had, the Chef assured me that it was only received that day but whether it had been stored in the heat or what I have no idea, it was not pleasant."
"I was also not impressed with receiving mussels with half their shells missing, they had been intentionally removed... just why would you?"
"...not just ""good"" , ...""FANTASTIC""....turned up as a party of 14 with mixed tastes and ages late one afternoon and we spent the whole evening there."
"Place has an execellent location which is discretely out of the main sea front hustle & bustle but at the same time has enough ""going on"" to keep the casual moments away from the superb food interesting...allow 25-35 euro's per head (including drinks) for an absolutely delightful array of freshly prepared gourmet standard foods."
"(even the childrens ""chicken nuggets"" were exceptional (full breast meat & home-made)) ...Staff were attentive and helpfull , and Yes, we highly recommend you give this the visit it deserves."
"Went to this restaurant , the food was okay but the menu not ideal for children,very little choice with vegetables.My paella was good but the garlic bread which was a small french loaf cut up was charged at 5 euro a basket which was well over the top.I might add that the bread was slipped on the table in a stealth manner with no room to compromise at the end.The staff didnt seem keen on the English as there were a lot of locals in the restaurant."
"Food was ok - sat inside, very large surcharge for sitting outside, food was late and not very exciting."
Staff were slow and not particularly helpful although they all spoke good English and the menu was available in English.
"If you want to sit outside be prepared to wait as this is obviously the most popular, getting a table inside didn't require any wait at all."
Tasca Eulalia is a gem!
The staff are really efficient and friendly.
"There is a great menu that has loads of tapas, racions, platos combinados."
There are tables outside in the summer and the tapas really are some of the best I have had and by far the best I had on this trip to Spain.
"The croquetas bacalao are unbelievable - not those awful fried croquetas you get that are covered in that horrible fake breadcrumb coating - but fresh, handmade, crumbly croquetas served with great alioli... tasty choricitos, great ensaladilla russa, mmmmm..."
"Fantastic food, friendly staff, reasonable prices."
Have visited this restaurant on many occasions over several years and each time the food is excellent.
A real variety of food.
"French onion soup, Lasage and Pork in Brandy Cream are particular favourites!"
"You might well get to this place, look inside, and think maybe we should find somewhere better."
DON'T.
This place might look like someones front living room with a kitchen stuck in it but the food is absolutely sublime.
"I have eaten in Thai restaurants all over the globe and paid three, four, even five times the price I paid here and this was the best food of all of them."
It is about 20 euros a head which in Barcelona is a steal.
JUST GO!
We ate dinner here one night and had some tapas and rice dishes.
"The rice was too heavily salted, but otherwise we enjoyed the experience."
In barcelona i had gone to four restraunts.
This restaurant had the best Indian food.
The taste was good.
The food was fresh.
The service was excellent.
"We booked a table ""with a view"" in advance, but got a standard table instead."
"The place was very crowded and a bit noisy, not a real romantic atmosphere even though it is on the beach side."
The food is OK but a bit overpriced.
"The design is nice with lovely details, all in Asian-Maroccan style."
We did not like the service: everything was super fast but: the bill came after we just have finished desert without being asked.
We felt more like in a fast-food cantine than in a posh restaurant and as they wanted to get rid of us as fast as possible.
This was the only restaurant we visited twice in Cala d'or.
This was because the rest of the places we ate in were rubbish.
At least with this place we got mainly edible food at a reasonable price.
On our first visit we just had main courses and pudding which for the price was of a reasonable quality.
The second time we had starters and mains.
This was where they fell down - the starters being totally inedible.
My wife had tomato soup which tasted suspiciously like a well known brand of the tinned variety!
I could have got that down the supermarket for under a quid.
Mine was the goats cheese salad which cost 8 euros and was just inedible.
Having said that when the mains came they did redeem themselves by serving good quality food.
Service was fine apart from the waiter whose eyes kept wandering every time i spoke to him.
I think he was ogling the women walking up and down the street outside.
"Our advice ,if you come here, would be to stick to mains and pudding and you should get a half decent meal"
Very nice traditional bodega with excellent tapas.
Best jamon iberico and olive oil in the city!
"i heard good reports about this restaurant, but i found it to be ok, nothing special"
Great little restaurant!
"What they lack in size, they make up for in quality food, including the best Jam Sponge with Custard on Earth and the friendliest family in the food business in Palmanova!"
Can't wait to get back!
Barcelona is a great city- lots to do- tons of people about but restaurants like Cal Pinxo on the harbour are in the business of completely fleecing tourists.
It seemed a really nice spot to watch the world go by- we wanted to have a special meal and had been recommended this restaurant by our airline (perhaps our first mistake?)
The menu was quite expensive but we were hoping that the quality of the food would offset the high price.
Admittedly my Spanish is not the best but I always endeavour to order in the local language- I feel it shows respect- but the staff weren't really interested in making sure that we understood one another.
Once we received our food our waitress asked me if I wanted my meal to be plated at our table or in the kitchen- I said I didn't mind and whatever was easier for her.
She blew a fuse- and marched away from our table mumbling under her breath.
I felt like a total fool- like I'd insulted her in some unknown way when I was trying to be amenable.
The staff never returned to ask about our meal and if it was ok or if we needed anything else etc.
I ordered the paella (one of the less expensive menu items) and it was so salty my tongue shrank in my mouth.
In fact I've never eaten such salty food in all my life- I couldn't taste anything but salt- like someone had upended a salt pot into it.
No one came to ask after us and we couldn't catch anyones eye to complain.
By this point we felt pretty upset.
In fact I was sat at the table in tears after the waitress was rude and insulting to me.
FInally a waiter stopped by (not the rude one from before she completely abandoned us) and we requested the bill.
When it came it had an automatic 7% service charge added (this is advertised in the menu but in rather small lettering) and we had been charged twice for bread service even tho we didn't eat it.
"So for 2 drinks (one beer, one brandy with coke) a shared green salad starter and two very basic (and one down right bad) main meals we were charged 70 euros."
I drank a 2 litre bottle of water that night because I could not quench my thirst after that salty meal.
And I felt quite ill the next day.
The whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.
I would recommend almost any of the tapas restaurants and cafes any day over Cal Pinxo.
They are mostly cheap and the food tastes nice and alot of them have outdoor seating in lovely squares.
If you want to eat in a special occasion restaurant then I wouldn't know where to begin- Cal Pinxo put me off trying any of the 'finer' restaurants.
All in all my experience at Cal Pinxo was a complete lack of atmosphere- incredibly rude staff- and paid through the nose for the pleasure.
Good manners cost nothing!
one of the best falafil i have eaten.
simply the best.
ate there two nights out of four.
"After living in Seville for 6 months, we found this the best of all the friedurias...fresh fish, cooked beautifully, and the least greasy!"
"Also, their fried chicken is a welcome change if you are not in the mood for fish."
They also have a lovely fresh tomato salad and the waiters from the fancy restaurant next door bring beer and drinks to the outdoor tables.
"Just remember that you get your food and pay for it in the freiduria, the drinks come separately."
enjoy!
"Bar, with non-smoking restaurant in the fantastic Monfrague National Park, they also have rooms."
"Very friendly(&speak English, rare for area)."
Good place to stop and chat with other people visiting park and find out what can be spotted where.
"Only place for miles, but very reasonable."
I would say this restaurant is a bit overrated here.
It's OK but nothing special.
"The best thing is the stylish yet cosy and welcoming atmosphere; the food is acceptable, and the prices, a bit steep."
"I will come again if I'm around, but it's certainly not a place I would go out of my way for."
"modern location, only one service staff which is extremely overextended, starter was excellent, main course bad!"
We went here because it was a lovely April day and it was nice to be in the sunshine on the Plaza Santa Cruz.
"Oh, and we'd just arrived at the Hotel Murillo around the corner and at 2.30 p.m. didn't want to start hunting round for somewhere to eat."
"The place looked expensive, but the standard of the food and service certainly did not justify the high cost."
We (2) paid 74.26 euros for two mediocre courses with a drink and coffee.
"But it was nice to watch the world go by for a couple of hours, including ladies in their beautiful dresses on their way to the Feria."
"stayed in sevilla at hotel amadeus, which was a very nice hotel."
was recommended by staff at hotel to eat at la albahaca.
dissapointing recommendation.
I ordered seabass in a yogurt sauce.
It was a white fish presented on a white plate with no garnishing and a small portion of fruit in a paper bag.
the only thing i tasted was salt.
Absolutley terrible.
My wife ordered iberica pork cheek with vegetables.
"We were absolutley positive the vegetables were from a can, and the pork was definitley from dinty moore."
"nice ambience to restaurant, especially if you eat outside, but the food is terrible."
would never recommend.
I have read some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor and I can't disagree more.
"We sat mesmerized at our table from 8:45 to 12:30 sampling what was simply the best, most elegant, thougthful tasting menu I've had."
Juan Muri Arzak even came out to our table to introduce himself and see how we were doing.
"Our waitress was more than attentive, she seemed to dote on us a little too much."
"The sommalier was attentive, though we only drank one moderately priced bottle over the four hour meal."
"From the moment we walked in we were treated like rock stars, and ate like kings."
"From our oping muse to flawless monkfish to the best foie gras I've ever eaten (coupled with a complimentary glass of wine) we left paying more than we would ever pay in New York, but it was worth it."
It was a night-long event of amazing culinary discoveries.
It made restaurants like Daniel and Nobu look like hot-dog stands.
"Been there few times and all of them were fantastic, any new time any surprise dish, Still remember one dish my first time that was poriac with caramel and fresh ""cigalas"" with sauce that was amazing good."
For price that you paid is superb.
"Try to go to any another restaurant of that level in another european city and check how much cost... Service can be better and restaurant itself for my is allready out of fashion, but as i wrote quality price is perfect."
It was my misfortune to eat here straight after a wonderful experience at Mugaritz.
"Perhaps, if I had eaten here first, it would have compared better."
"The best adjective I can think of is ""complacent""."
The food is good (even though I didn't care for a couple of the dishes on the tasting menu I have to admit they were well-constructed) but one would expect that of a three-star restaurant.
It wasn't spectacular but it was very good.
What let the restaurant down was the service.
The wait staff were competent but not friendly.
The sommelier was brusque.
It took a while to seat us.
Orders were confused on two occasions.
"Dishes on the tasting menu were described in vague terms, making it difficult if one had food allergies or dislikes."
(Compare this to El Bulli where they check this all out by email before you even arrive !)
"This, compounded with all the emails and telephone calls required to confirm our reservation, gave us the impression that the restaurant considered us fortunate to even be there."
Everything was business-like but there seemed little interest in the customer.
"So, decent food at top prices, and disappointing service."
excellent restaurant extensive menu well cooked meals I have been eating here with my wife for the last 15 years beaitiful inside rooms or try the rooftop balcony where you can eat and drink with a panoramic view of andalucia Recommended
Excellent but basic food quickly served in the Spannish manner.
i.e.
a basic hello but no effusive welcome.
You may have to wait for a seat at weekends but they give you a a nice vibrating caller (it also flashes - it's huge fun) Good service and they won't rush you.
If you order a good wine they may even give you decent glasses - if they don't ASK the horrid small wine glasses are vile.
As a fish eater the sole is always small but good and filleted for you.
The prawns in garlic are spot on and a large portion.
Stays open till very late
Don't know why tourists flock to Mercat de la Boqueria.
"Mercat Santa Caterina is cleaner, far less crowded, and even cheaper."
The produce is simply gorgeous (see photo).
There is a deli stand with cheeses which will vacuum-pack for you!
The restaurant is delightful - everything was fresh and delicious.
The gazpacho was outstanding; the vegetarian eggroll was the best I've ever eaten.
The calamari were quite fine.
Go enjoy the market and have a light lunch at the restaurant if you're planning a big dinner.
Be prepared to spend about 10-15 euros per dish.
We were 2 persons (speaking 7 languagues at native level..including italian) not spanish speaking.
This introduction just to say that El rall was most probably the most unfriendrly place ever been to...waitress was bothered to explain and no one of them was clearly willing to let us know what the food was (given that we were looking for something vegetarian).
However food took ages but honesty was ok...nothing amazing considering the price you pay.
"So food is ok, price bit too expensive and really horrible service...you choose what is really important (honestly i love traditional slow food places and i am willing to pay a bit more for quality...BUT i am the one who pays and i do not feel confortable when the one that gets my money has this disrepct for people)"
"We had 3 of the tapas choices for starters, one of which was the foie grois, it was to die for!"
Our daughter tasted it for the first time and said it just melted in her mouth!
I had goats cheese which was equally as nice.
We all had the suckling pig which was very tasty.
The creme brulee and strawberries filled with brulee were yummy!
"At 248 euros for 3, it was not the cheapest of meals we have ever had !"
"But it was one of the most memorable and tastiest, that was for pre dinner cocktails, a 3 course dinner with coffee and liqours, and a bottle of Moet !"
"We had a lovely evening and the staff were attentive but not too much, and will certainley return if we visit Palma again."
The restaurant itself was attractive- in terms of decor and ambience I would give it a high score.
"Our table was near a window/small balcony overlooking the street below, which was pleasant ,and the general feel was relaxed with good but not overly attentive (therefore intrusive) service."
"The menu looked extremely inviting, however, when the food arrived it was a bit of a disappointment, not because it was bad, but just lacking in flavour."
I ordered salmon on a bed of rice with orange and saffron sauce but I found it quite bland and my partner said the same about his dish.
"For dessert we ordered the fruit and chocolate fondue which, again, was nothing to write home about."
"Considering the prices, I would say that the food was not quite up to scratch and I would expect something a little more tasty."
"Read several great reviews, but it definitely wasn't our favorite tapas spot in Seville."
Did enjoy the lamb and honey sauce and meatballs.
thee food is vey nicee however the staff are quite unfriendly and the meal takes a long time to arrive :) the atomsphere is very good and the value is quite good as the foood is nicee :)xx
"7 Portes is known as a landmark restaurant, and tourists flock there for that reason."
The menu has tabs for different languages.
That should have been a tip-off.
"We arrived early for dinner at 7:30, and had no wait."
We ordered for starters a tasting of classical Catalanian foods.
Nothing was tasty.
I ordered lambchops with a special aoili sauce.
The 4 lampchops were thin and tough.
The sauce was cold from the fridge and had a consistency of glue.
The wine was excellent (I don't think you can go wrong in Barcelona).
The best thing about the meal were the rolls served with four different bottles of wonderful olive oil.
I went to the 7 Portes based upon a recommendation from the concierage at my Hotel.
I found the setting dark but not unpleasant.
The sangria was just okay but the Rich Man's Paella was very disappointing.
I found the menu extremely expensive.
I had some wonderful Paella in Ibiza and this couldn't even compare in any way.
Paella is a dish that should be prepared fresh with golden saffron.
The Paella served here a.ppears to be dark brown and very salty.
I couldn't hardly find any seafood.
This restaurant is priced like a 5 star but serves ONE star quality food.
There are much better places to eat in Barcelona that are not nearly as expensive.
Next time I will stick to the Tapas bars.
Had dinner her on Wed June 24th.
"We had the tasting menu, which ran a stinging EUR 155 per person."
But it was well worth every cent.
"We started our meal at 9pm and were the last to leave at 2am, after an endless stream of highly imaginative and exquisite dishes."
"The presentation was artistic, the flavors surprising, delicious, and fun, and each course was a surprise."
"Nearly 1/3 of the menu was desert related, and included a wonderful cheese plate with matching savory in the middle of the procession of foods."
The deserts are a real surprise and I can honestly say I've never had anything like them - really fantastical!!!!
"I can't really speak for the wine list, since I was with two very light drinkers, but we were recommended a decent and well priced Cava for the meal."
I took an excellent spanish red by the glass later in the meal and wish I could remember what it was....but there were so many interesting flavors and foods parading by my seat that evening that I'm afraid I was rather overwhelmed by the whole affair.
I haven't had a food experience like this for quite a long time.
And yes - the service was really a perfect compliment to the food.
"Informative, and just perfect."
"Ive been to many restaurants, in many countries around the world, but nothing comes close to Tijuana Tex Mex in San Antonio, Ibiza."
"Before I even tell You about the superb food, the first thing You see, as You approach and enter the restaurant, is the incredible decor!"
Its amazing!!
The whole place is decorated in a traditional mexican / aztec theme!
"Its truly awesome, not entirely unlike a theme park!!"
"Then, You are met by the most welcoming,perpetually happy staff imaginable, who show You to a table where You are invited to decorate Your table cloth with chalk while wearing amusingly over sized mexican hats!"
"The food is fantastic and the menu is presented in three languages, with many vegetarian options."
"To round off the meal, You are invited to partake in the traditional mexican party trick of electrocution!!"
"-Its not as deadly as it sounds, but it is hilarious!"
"Finally, You are offered a 'chupito' - A fine gold tequila, with cinnemon and orange, rather than salt and lemon."
"Simply the greatest dining experience You will ever witness, You'll want to go again and again!!"
- I do!!
!
We went early and sat outside.
Serivce was just OK but the fish was delicious.
The title says it all.
Try the house lemonade.
It is delicious!
We tried this place after reading the reviews but were left disappointed.
The owner is welcoming but in a slightly ' cheesy ' way and as previously stated appears proficient in several languages.
The setting is pleasing but quite cramped and I think would be extremely hot when full.
The food was ok but nothing out of the ordinary and the sound of the microwave pinging every few minutes was disappointing.
The lemonade is refreshing but be aware that there is no alcohol available.
We went here for dinner based on the reviews on this site and had a wonderful meal.
We were happily greeted and the service was very good.
Don't be put off if it's empty inside!
"There were just a few other diners, but some were obviously local customers who were regulars (always a good sign!)."
"As many have mentioned, the suckling pig is amazing!"
"We also had the lamb, another speciality, which was also tender and flavorful."
The portions are large and come with a seasoned potato on the side.
You also get a small antipasta plate and have the option to order bread with tomato.
The wine selection is very nice.
We would highly recommend this restaurant.
"The service was very good, the portions generous, the food outstanding."
"But best of all, the atmosphere in this little gem of a restaruant was eclectic, interesting and quite nice."
"Several blocks off Plaza Mayor, Cornucopia is located on a queit side street."
You aren't likely to find it without looking.
"The Risotto was outstanding, the beef very good, but all of the appetizers were wonderful."
This was our favorite restaurant visited in Madrid or Barcelona.
"The menu combines some traditional Spanish elements, like delicious croquettes, with other unexpected items, like ravioli with pear (which was delicious, and I don't even like pears)."
It was easy to get into and we couldn't figure out why it wasn't packed.
Don Pe is a really nicee restraunt the staff are very funny and friendlyy especially Israel :) the food is really nice and the atomsphere is very good too !
Most nights on my holiday i eat here as it is the best restrauntt everr !!
xx
The atmosphere here is always incredible!!!
I went several times and would highly recommend if you are visiting Madrid.
"Produced in Andalusia, Jerez - or Sherry - is an extraordinary wine which in past times was considered among the best ones of the world, a masterpiece of wine making art rich and enchanting."
"The service was poor in all aspects--everything was a mad rush, orders immediately taken and food immediately swept away."
I have never had such a quick sit-down restaurant meal before.
"As a previous reviewer noted, when 2 main courses come out 2 minutes after ordering them, you indeed think that they are not freshly made-to-order."
"On the plus side, the prices were very cheap and the food tasted basically okay."
I would not return and would not recommend it to anyone.
There are so many better restaurants in Madrid!
The atmosphere and decoration of this restaurant is really lovely – but this is all.
I really do not know why this restaurant has good reputation in Madrid.
We have eaten at this restaurant for many years and indeed have had a good time.
In the summer it can be a bit rushed but last week I was amazed at the poor service.
"Four of us ordered our meal, mine was lasagne with a bowl of chips."
"The meals were brought out and my lasagne was like a dish of milk, my husband said you can't eat that and called the waiter and sent it back."
"The waiter came back and said two minutes, everyone finished their meals and to be fair they said they were nice, mine never appeared."
My husband went to find a waiter and told them to cancel it as everyone was finished and it was too late.
"The waiter came, no apology, cleared the table (including my half finished chips) and put the bill on the table."
"Amazing, my daughters said that apart from the fact that I had had no dinner, it was really funny!!"
Everyone seemed to disappear as we left the restaurant and I thought obviously they were offended because I complained.
I will not be going back nor will I recommend this restaurant again.
Very bad service and rude.
"We ate at this restaurant during a recent Moraira trip, the food was very good and the service attentive and friendly."
"An all time must when visiting Pollensa, good food and excellent hospitalllity."
"Don't be put off by what looks like formal surroundings on the outside, its a family run restaurant inside."
The Sea Bass Speciality is always a delight.
"Elegantly presented, fine dining without being OTT Staff were polite and helpful when asked for recommendations Ate there two nights out of three - enough said!"
El Raco is part of a chain.
We have been three times to the restaurant in the Rambla de Catalunya and have not been disappointed.
We stick to the 10 euro lunch menu which is three good size dishes of Mediterranean food washed down with a large glass of wine.
"The fixed menu changes daily and has not disappointed.The restaurant is large, plenty of space between tables and is generally very clean."
It represents as good a value as you will ever get near the Plaza Catalunya.
Expect to pay around 25 euros for a three course meal without wine if you don´t have the menu.
My daughter and I stopped to have lunch at the cafe at 86 paseo de gracia (opp.
Casa Batllo).
We met a friend for a birthday lunch.
"The food was fine - we had 2 paellas (v. small) and I ordered ONE pizza baguette, also had 2 cans of coke and a large bottle of water."
I was totally SHOCKED when the bill came with a total of 76.50 !!
!euros - the paellas were 25 euro each - the one pizza baguette was cutr into 4 pieces which were charged at 8.50 for 2 - making the whole thing 17 euros!!!
The drinks were comparable to other places for drinking on the terrace.
My daughter and I had eaten the night before in a proper restaurant and had 2 paellas + 2 large beers for a total of 23 euros (and the paellas were slightly larger - being priced at 8.50 euros each).
There didn't appear to be any prices visible on the menus or at the shop front.
I would recommend you try and avoid this place or risk getting totally ripped off.
I visited this lovely quaint restaurant with my husband for a romantic meal for two and it didnt disappoint.
"Warm welcome, great atmosphere and the food was absolutely delicious, the best meal I had had for a long time."
"I had spicy prawns with coconut rice for starters, crispy duck with blackberry sauce for main and as I have a sweet tooth opted for the gypsy tart (caramel) with cream."
All this polished off with half a bottle of wine.
"A five star meal at such a reasonable price too, only E19.50 per head including wine and bread."
The location is also very quaint in the old town of Calpe near the church but its a gem find.
"Having read all about the restaurant before our holiday and having been to Calpe many times, passed the place thought we would give it a try."
"We had a very warm English welcome, were suprised just how big the place was."
The place was packed!
We found it very warm and quite breezy through the small windows which were the only means of air.
OK the food was ok but I suppose being an English restaurant that's where we made a mistake - too much like home cooking.
"We enjoyed the wine offered, and when we came to leave did pass a remark that our table itelf was very uncomfortable as you couldn't get your legs under the table."
"We were told it was because they had to move tables round to accommodate everyone, but the table design themselves at fault."
"So, we may give them another go when we go later in the year just to see if things are more comfortable."
Well worth a visit to Calpe old town to find the Patio.
After visiting Calpe for many years only just heard about this wonderful restaurant.
Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.
A good place to eat.
Good value and a really enjoyable experience.
Well recommended.
Will definitely add it to my agenda for future visits.
My wife and I were so pleasantly surprised by the dining experience we recently had at Gorria Restaurant.
The food is wonderful.
Wonderful local fish dishes.
Do NOT miss the turbot naturally prepared.
"The waiters speak limited English, but try to be very helpful and friendly."
They certainly are knowledgeable about the fine menu food and add to the traditional atmospehere of this very enjoyable restaurant.
Get the homemade wine.
We decided to sit inside this restaurant & found a small table near the door so we could still see the action on La Rambla.
We were totally ignored by the staff there.
After waiting for quite a while we decided to see if we could find a table right on La Rambla.
"We did & ordered a medium sangria (15e), an order of chicken croquettes (4,20e) & some mixed olives (3,90)...so for 23,10e without tip we were able to feel part of this very busy & famous pedestrian street."
There was plenty to see (street entertainment & street performers) plus tourists (like us) and the people who live in beautiful Barcelona.
"I loved the beautiful flower stalls, bird market & mimes who make their living on La Rambla."
That alone was worth the price.
"Our waiter did not speak English, but we managed by pointing to what we wanted on the menu."
My husband enjoyed one of the breakfast combos while I loved the churros and chocolate.
"We seemed to be the only Americans in the place, and I was shocked there weren't tons of tourists because it's a great location with great breakfast."
We spent a week in Calan Porter and dined at El Pulpo four out of seven nights.
The service was very good and by the end of the week staff were very friendly and even noticed that we were sharing our starters to try new things and gave us side plates so we could cooose a little of each starter.
Food was of very good quality if a little pricey but that seems normal now for most Euro areas.
"Definitely worth a visit, especially if in walking distance from your villa as it was for us."
"Sandy, Louis & Linda are very cheerful."
"Food is great value and most importantly, they will cook half portions of everything on menu for children - this is so much better than sausages/nuggets and chips which is so common in other restaurants."
have gone there every many times over many years and will be back this July.
"Having just returned from our seventh trip to Nerja we feel compelled to write a review on the wonderful ""Haveli"" restaurant on Calle Cristo."
Year in and year out this firmly remains our favourite restaurant in Nerja.
"The food is second to none, with it's freshly prepared ingredients and wonderful flavours, and we defy anyone to eat there and not return for more!"
"My husband is Indian and reckons the Haveli is the only place that serves food that tastes ""as good as his Mum's!"""
"Believe me, that's a huge compliment!"
The ambience of the restaurant is truely fantastic and is even more enjoyable in the open air dining area at the back of the restaurant.
Each year we see the same friendly staff working at the Haveli which can only suggest that the wonderfully charming owners are just that!
We shall be returning to Nerja next year and the Haveli will definately be our first port of call.
"Oh, and lastly, they've been established there for 23 years now so I guess that speaks for itself!"
"I heard rave reviews about their paella, but we just didn't feel it was that great."
"The waiters are very aggressive about asking for a tip, which bordered on being rude."
"No bad overall, but disappointing."
You wait and wait to get in and them wish you had walked away.
"Yes it is old and the place is interesting to look at but what about good food and service, neither of which are present."
Friends of our visited it months before we did and liked it but I simply suggest it be avoided.
At first we thought they werent open since the first dinning area is for non smokers and they smoke like chimneys in Spain.
So we entered to a pretty but empty dinning room when we were informed there were several groups in the back room we asked to be seated where the crowd was.
As we turned the corner we were taken back to an old world of quaint villages and old Spain.
The brick walls and wood beams surround a fireplace that makes you believe your old grandmother was about to cook you a stew.
"With the friendly wait staff we were introduced to the traditional version of bruschetta when we were brought toasted breads a whole tomato each, a couple cloves of garlic and salt to make our own."
It was a great time with the Host Jose who was off that night but brought in a friend of his for tapas and drinks.
"Our waiter who spoke enough english to help us understand (almost) what he suggested for us to eat and the Chef who is a Maestro gastronomist made us the most fabulous meal that included a balsamic reduction with pinons, currants, onion and spices over melt in your mouth veal topped with a goat cheese that was a meal to remember."
With Jose and his Liquors and some wonderful pastry with icecream inside we thought we were finished but we were treated to a couple more drinks and coffees and wonderful conversation that was filled with broken spanish on my part and incredible friendship.
This restaurant is not to be missed.
For the second time in one week time we had a extended lunch at this restaurant.
The setting is lovely.
"It is quiet, there is enough shade and wind to prevent overheating."
You can see the small marina and see a lively environment.
"The service is good, friendly and correct, and the food is of a high standard."
"To our surprise some people talk Dutch, Vlaams accent."
That is because of the Belgium influence due to the owner.
The Sabayon is my favorite desert.
Don't forget to try this when you are visiting the place.
but worth the journey!
"Great paella - stay away from the tourist traps with pictures of their food, this place is where the locals go."
What a great dining experience.
My favorite restaurant in Barcelona and my wife's second favorite.
"From the moment you enter the restuarant and are welcomed by the master maitre'd, who exudes flawless professionalism, to your leaving with the doorman running to get you a taxi cab, your experience is absolutely inspiring."
"The food is outrageously good with high gourmet dishes and, unlike more expensive restuarants, portions large enough to satisfy you."
The wine list is reasonable with a very helpful sommelier.
"Everything about eating at Via Veneto is elegant, memorable, and will cause you to return again and again."
Beautifully restored historical building.
Good service.
Had a good meal at this restaurant on our last night in Madrid.
Good selection of dishes and wines.
While there was no dress code the dinners were almost all Spanish and well dressed.
The food here is fantastic.
Its incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection.
I recommend the garlic mushrooms to start.
But I also recommend the avocado and prawn salad!
This is why we always have to spend at least three nights of our holiday here!
I've been going to Mojacar for 11 years and the same people have worked here since the beginning.
"Very friendly, family run business and always a pleasure."
The leg of lamb is beautiful but just make sure not to eat too much that day as its a lot of food!
The lasagne is the best in Mojacar and setting is lovely - on a platfrom overlooking the sea.
This restaurant does not deserve two stars.
"The food lacks balance, is poorly seasoned and the service is downright arrogant."
"If you are in the Catalan region and want a better dining experience go to: San Pau, ABaC, Comerc 24, Alkimia or Can Fabes, all are considerably better."
"My husband had a hunch about this place, and he was right."
"The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was relaxing and comforting."
"The food was middle-eastern, based in the owner's Syrian background, but with Spanish flavors as well."
"A salad topped with goat cheese and crisp-fried jamon, Pescado Sephardi -- a fish fillet with a light tahini sauce, thin-cut grilled lamb chops."
"We couldn't decide on dessert, so Wael (the owner/manager) brought us each a small piece of all three choices -- a rich moist chocolate cake, a piece of baklava, and the knock-out: something called Dulce de Queso, a moist, almost custardy slightly-sweet square made with couscous, cheese, honey, and jasmine."
"It sounds odd, but the result is delicious."
"Wael has a great nose for good, affordable wines."
We shared a bottle of a 2007 Mesta tempranillo.
"We loved the food, but the experience was shaped by the host, who made us feel welcome, took time to talk with us about the food and wine, and expressed a great sense of passion and well-deserved pride about his place."
Visited this restaurant with my cousin who lives in Nerja on the second Sunday in May.
She had previously been here with a friend and suggested I came this time to see what I thought of the place.
The restaurant was quite busy but we were seated straight away and asked what we would like to drink.
The menu had a BIG choice and it was difficult to decide what to have.
I decided on the roasted salmon.
"It was delicious, the only thing I would say is that the vegetables that came with it could have been more adventurous."
My companion had the vegetable bruchetta which looked and tasted very good.
"I recommend this restaurant completely to any visitor to Nerja, after all if the local expats recommend it, it's got to be good!"
"Casual, moderately priced Italian in a great neighborhood."
We had risotto with mushrooms and gorgonzola and tagliata for our main courses.
The tagliata - grilled beef slices on a bed of rocket with parmesan shavings - was excellent.
The risotto was a bit heavy on the sauce but delicious.
The bread was not memorable.
"The deserts were good, but not outstanding."
The wine was marvelous.
"In all, this is a nice, casual, comfortable place for a pleasant, affordable meal."
Ate here with friends.
We were a little worried after reading some of the reviews about the possible price so kept our wits about us!!
We needn't have worried.
A menu was duly presented at the outset complete with prices.
"At the end we were charged for some bread we hadn't ordered, but we weren't charged for the beautiful chorizo that was left on our table at the outset, the gorgeous chunks of cake that were presented following the meal, or the absinthe shots/peach schnapps."
The food was amazing...massive portions and cooked to perfection.
"Not the cheapest place in Barcelona, but we were impressed by the price paid for the amount and quality of food presented."
Having read the previous review of this property we were very apprehensive about our week at Sa Savina.
However we found the experience somewhat different.
The villa in its own extensive grounds is beautifull.
Electric remote controlled gates lead up a long curved driveway to the imposing property.
We found the villa was generaly in good condition I found the the shower in the downstairs bathroom had some evidence of sand in it but other than that everything was spick and span.
There were some items that needed attention.
The dishwasher we discovered threw the tablet out of its holder all the time and therefore did not clean items properley.
The washing machiine was tempremental and needed attention.
We reported these on departure but they did not spoil our holiday.
We requested via the rep a socket not working and a maintenance man was there within the hour and fixed it.
our only other criticism was the lack of seating in the lounge.
For a large property that can sleep ten people two double sofas is not enough.
Despite these gripes we had a most enjoyable time at Sa Savina it is a generally well maintained property in good condition.The swimming pool is lovely with a childrens slide and the pool maintenance man visited every day at about 7am to ensure that everything was OK and clean add chemicals etc.
I can only suppose that the other reviewer was very unlucky with the time of his visit and can sympathise with his obvious frustration and annoyance at all the problems.
judging by our experience most things have been rectified and Mallorca Farmhouses seem to be doing a good job.
On this basis I would have no hesitation in recommending this property.
I have visited this restaurant twice in the last year - once with a group of 10 and with my partner this week.
The food was excellent both times as was the wine.
We had the 13.95 euro menu - circa 6 - 8 choices for each of the three courses - and all of our selections were excellent.
Its setting in the Call and size - it probably has only 10 -15 tables makes a great atmosphere.
I believe Azafran restaurant is one of the best in all of Seville.
"I consider myself a ""foodie"" and I just spent 5 weeks in Seville eating out every night and sampling the best that the city has to offer."
"I stumbled upon Azafran, a little modern tapas bar and restaurant on Av."
"de Borbolla, and I was blown away; I have now eaten there 4 times with my husband, ordering a variety of specials recommended by the waiter, and have never been disappointed."
"Memorable dishes were the grilled beef, huevos de chocos (tender fried squid), gulas tapa, pollo a la carbonara, solomillo a la mostaza, arroz marisco, and cola de toro, just to name a few."
The service is amazing - really impressive for the area.
I just can't say enough.
It's out of the tourist area.
But if you're touring near Plaza de Espana - just go down Av.
Borbolla toward the main thorogh fare and you'll find it.
Cheers
"Really small, nice and quaint place."
I love it :-)
My husband and I stayed near this little seafood bar on our recent trip to Madrid.
"We pushed our way in, through the crowded entry, based on the display of seafood in the window, and we weren't disappointed."
"We had to ask the waiter what the folks at the next table were eating, because it looked so good -- sort of like big chunks of lobster."
The answer: pulpo a la gallega.
Great choice.
"Nice slices of octopus, cooked (we think) with a little jamon, served over potatoes, all topped with great olive oil and a little pimenton."
"That and a glass of the house rioja, and we were very happy."
"A few days later, the Salpicon de Mariscos -- a marinated salad of shrimp and vegetables -- was almost as good."
"It's a noisy little place, full of locals, friendly, a little smoky, and great fun."
Popular with locals and while they don't speak much English we were with their help able to figure out the menu.
Just returned from 2 weeks in Pollenca.
"Lots of excellent restaurants in the old town but this is the only one we went back to... Great food, good atmospher and excellent location (in the town square)."
Many locals were eating here so thats what attracted us at first.
The staff were attentive without being over fussy.
The menu choice was good and all the dishes we had were wonderful.
I'd recommend sharing the seaford/tropical salad to start and then followed by the tuna or seaford pasta.
Wines were good and not too expensive.
"Overall, a really enjoyable dining experience."
"Average price for 1 started, 2 mains, wine and coffees was 69 euros."
This is one of the best places to eat ANYWHERE.
The food is outstanding and the location on this wonderful square guarantees plenty of entertainment while you eat.
We ate there five nights out of the seven we spent in Pollenca.
Our only dilemma was what to choose from their menu because everything we tried became a new favourite.
The standards are impeccable and the owner keeps a close eye that these never slip.
A wonderful and memorable dining experience.
"Based on Tripadvisor, thought this was one of the places to eat Had rack of lamb but when we complained all that was suggested was a 'drink on the house'; this was declined and that was it!"
"Very busy location, so I can only assume that customer satisfaction doesn't rank that highly for them."
This restaurant had a vast selection of delicious sea food but the prices weren't cheap for Spain.
"However, there was a sea food festival on while we were there, so special offers were available."
The staff weren't overly friendly but the lovely food compensated.
"This is a lovely restaurant for those who like fish and seafood, although it does some meat dishes as well."
"Very clean and comfortable, with efficient service and also good value, an added bonus for those of us who do not speak Spanish is the English menu."
Try and visit if you are in Madrid-you will not be disappointed.
A local contact suggested this restaurant and it was a definite highlight of the trip to eat such terrific food that didn't cost a bomb.
It's a good place for both Spanish favourites and dishes from around the Mediterranean.
"The delicious starters included goats cheese with caramelised onions and a fruity sauce, a mound of sweet potato and tuna wrapped in bacon and fried fritters made from cod and batter."
"Mains include traditional fish dishes, spinach canneloni in a smoked cheese sauce and Moroccan lamb with fruity couscous."
Everything was delicious and well presented with classy touches.
"Add in the stylish decor and linen tablecloths and it felt like a very expensive restaurant, but most plates cost about €8."
Decent bottles of wine are available for €10 so two people can have two courses each and share a dessert and bottle of wine for €40.
"Despite the upmarket feel to the place, most diners on our weeknight visit were dressed casually."
After reading multiple reviews about numerous TOP Japanese restaurants in Barcelona we came across this gem walking back to our hotel.
"The restaurant itself was beautiful, service was great and the food second to none."
"After eating at one of the best (Koyshunka) the food here was superb in comparison, which is saying something as Koyshunka was great."
yumyumyum I recommend this place to anyone
But it is not really suitable for families with kids.
Lots of drinking.
"Gets some cross-over business from foreign college kids, learning Spanish in Ronda."
The beer and wine is cheap.
The food is not great.
We ate at this place because of it's location and the menu looked comparable to the other restaurants in the area.
We opted for the fixed price menu mainly because the other food seemed a little over priced.
This was a big mistake.
Our service was slow and pretty unfriendly.
We observed service at other tables and it seemed the same.
My meal started out with a salad which was OK but it went down hill.
The next course was a chicken leg which looked like it had been cooked the previous day and was warmed again just before it was served.
It was inedible.
How do you overcook a chicken leg.
I don't even remember the rest of the meal.
My husband had fish which was at least edible.
"I called the waiter over and told him the food was horrible and he said ""was it dry?"""
so I suspect he knew the problem.
We have learned our lesson and will never again eat at a restaurant which has only tourists eating there.
We have had much better food by seaking out the restaurants out of the main tourist areas and which are patronized by locals.
"It stands back off the road, wedged between a garage and an electrical shop an innocuous long low building with dark red shutters."
Having passed it numerous times we felt we really must try it as while other restaurants these days are empty there are always lots of cars both at lunchtime and in the evening outside of La Brasa.
When you go inside there is a kitchen on display to the left and to the right a long room with a low beamed ceiling and lot of tables.
"We were met by a waiter (there were at least 8 of them) and asked if we wanted smoking, which we did and we were taken to a room behind the first with about 10 tables."
"The walls were decorated with bull, deer and wild boar heads and a large wheel converted to hold lights hung from the very very high ceiling."
Along the back wall of this room was a glass temperature controlled wine store about 20 x 6.
"A ramp led up to another level which turned out to be a bar area and everywhere was spotlessly clean, I had expected a small rural type restaurant but the place is like a ´Tardis´ from the outside it certainly doesn´t look as big."
The menu and wine list arrive.
Even a non-drinker like me could tell there was something for all tastes with wines ranging from around €10 to €200 a bottle.
So the meal.
Bread was expensive at €1.65 but when it arrives it is was hot toast about 1” thick and came with a plate of garlic and home-grown tomatoes and a bottle of virgin olive oil.
"The starter at €11 was king prawns in garlic, about a dozen in each serving but not too bad as we decided to share."
This is not a place for fish lovers; there was only a choice of 3 fish dishes on the menu but lots of meat.
Those who went for either the pork or beef chops (I would call this a rib of beef rather than a chop) were provided with a large bib and the meal came on sizzling hot plates.
"The lamb chops about 8 looked delicious, and I went for the fillet steak."
Two of them arrived on my plate at least an inch thick if not more and a good 4” dia.
"The vegetables, red peppers, onions, chips and Canarian potatoes."
The steak was delicious and the knife just slid through it.
There was no room for pudding but they looked good and prices varied from around €4.50 to €6.00.
With coffees and drinks the bill came to €60 per couple but well worth it.
"In this climate I agree that it is not cheap especially when you can get a meal for €6 in PdlA but the quality was superb and the place was full, there was not a single table free and the majority were locals which in itself says something."
We have visitors arriving at the end of the month and we will certainly be taking them there for a taste of real Tenerife.
Just goes to show that what you see on the outside is not always what you get.
We ate here on Sunday night.
"We had no reservation, but the staff accommodated us at short notice."
The courtyard were we dined was gorgeous and are starters were really nice.
The wine was overpriced though.
We had to wait a while for our food which wasn't a problem as were were enjoying the ambiance.
My wife and I both ordered fillet steaks cooked rare which were medium to well done on arrival.
We alerted the waiting staff politely after the first bite and requested new steaks to be prepared.
Our two plates were taken away without apology.
Within two minutes the manager returned with the same two plates.
She was agressive and insisted and they were rare steaks and asked for us to come to a more well lit area to show us that the steaks were indeed rare.
"By this stage, she was disturbing the rest of the customers, so unfortunately we were bullied into accepting the same meals back again."
"To add insult to injury, she asked us a few minutes later whether things were better now."
Of course we pointed out that how could things be better as they were the same steaks.
"Overall, this restaurant needs to learn some basic customer care and manners."
I will not be returning any time in the next 100 years.
The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating.
"When we had dinner there, most people were sat outside, but we decided to sit inside as it was dark outside."
So the atmosphere was lacking a little bit as there were very few diners inside.
But this didn't in any way spoil our experience.
The quality of the food more than made up for that.
"We had the mussels with the mango sauce and hummous for starters, and we shared a paella for the main course."
The combination of ingredients may sound a bit strange at first but it really works.
Everything was very tasty.
They also have a good wine selection.
"The service was very good, getting the right balance between paying you attention but not hanging around whilst you're eating."
The waiters are also familiar with the menu and are able to make suggestions.
"For example, our waiter suggested that we have only one starter to share as two starters might be too much before the paella."
"Overall, a great place to eat and would defintely go back again if we go back to Granada."
We loved Azafran!
The food was amazing as was the view of the Alhambra.
We sat outside and were admist the lively streets of Granada and we enjoyed a local group of musicians preforming.
"The couscous with lamb was outstanding, the Iberian secret was tasty, and the dulce de leche crepe topped the evening off nicely."
My wife were in Barcelona for one night prior to a cruise in the mediterranean and were recommended this retaurant for good tapas by the concierge at our hotel.
"Having also seen the restaurant mentioned in some of my travel research, we decided to give it a try."
My wife and I had no trouble getting in the restaurant shortly after 6pm on a Saturday night.
We shared several tapas and were pleased with all.
"Highlights were the mushrooms, and chorizo."
I'd definitely recommend it to others.
Amonst our memories of Barcelona will be Tapas and Wine at Cituat Comtal in the catalunya district of barcelona.

"One evening we reache around 10 :00 p.m. and had to wait for half an hour before being seated The service was prompt , efficient and jovial Food ( both vegetarian and non vegetarian ) was delicious and the Tapas came coming at coforatbel and regular intervals."
The next visit we sat on the pavement tables and found everything same.
Highly recommended and is good for vegetarians Pallavi and Paddu Kapadia
This place ends up with queues waiting for a table.
Great food and reasonably priced.
Enjoyed watching the staff bustle about.
"The asparagus is particularly good, and probably the best value is to order a mixed tapas plate."
Some of the staff are more helpful than others.
Good basic tapas place in Barcelona.
Dishes were well-prepared but not completely exceptional.
Good value for the prices.
We thought the Tapas were outstanding.
Went for Lunch and we simply loved it.
Lots of Beer options and good sangria
"Just got back from a 9 night stay in the port area of Estepona, and ate in this restaurant on 3 of those nights!!"
"As stated in previous reviews, the food is freshly cooked, and service is friendly and efficient."
"On the second night we went in, we were given free drinks upon asking for the bill, which was again repeated on the third occasion, when we were treated like life-long friends!!"
"All in all, a very pleasant experience, worth reccommending."
We visit the Palacio del Marques at least once whilst holidaying in Lanzarote.
"It is the perfect place to while away an afternoon with good company, great food and excellent wine."
"The first time we visited, our waiter suggested a Rose to accompany our tapas."
"Whilst not being too keen on rose, he assured us it would be perfect - and he was right, so much so we took 3 bottles of the same wine away with us!"
"The food is great, the service is excellent, our waiter (can't remember his name but he was French) was brilliant and knew his wine, and, the suroundings are beautiful."
"Perfect combination of music and atmosphere, although a bit expensive, but I believe it is well worth it."
This was the most expensive meal I had in Seville and while quite good was not quite what I expected.
I had at least one better meal during my last visit and another that while perhaps only equal in terms of the food offered a better value and more atmosphere.
"If you are near the airport and want to eat an outstanding meal at reasonable prices do not miss ONA NUIT Is a small restaurant with funky decor, but the food is to die for and the deserts are incredible."
Which we had something like that at home.
Don't miss it if you can.
After seeing Paella served on La Rambla I knew I had to try it before we left Barcelona.
We spent a lot of time in Placa Reial & had eaten at most all the restaurants there and we were approached many times by the waiters at Ambos Mundos with a book of pictures of the Paella dishes available there.
"We decided to order a liter of Sangria (10,60e) & we both ordered the Paella with seafood (10,95e each = 21,90e) which was served in one pan."
"There was not that much seafood, but it was good...not great!"
We were warned in our travel book not to order food in restaurants that have books with pictures as they are geared to the tourists.
We travel a lot & found very few English speaking waiters in Barcelona even in the heavily touristy areas of the city which makes it difficult to know what you are getting.
This restaurant is in a beautiful square & we were entertained by street performers.
"I have been here several times, but this was my first lunch here with a group of 12 people and it was good food and well choosen wines but it is a bit pricy and I think that the restaurant is ""nicer"" to visit for dinner with all the candles and so on, but we had a great time as always here with great service and very nice three (+) course lunch."
We ate on two nights here.
It's near the mezquita - easy to find.
The menu is extensive for tapas and drinks.
"The food was well cooked, presented and served."
The service was effecient and friendly.
The place has a nice feel to it.
Much better value than some of the restaurants around the Juderia.
"If you should find yourself in the fishing village of La Carihuela (or anywhere in the Torremolinos area), then you would be foolish to overlook this bar/ restaurant as it is so much more than just that."
"Tucked off of the main strip, away from the 'bigger' restaurants, this sits on a lovely andalucian street, so quiet you could be in the andalucian hills or in the white towns."
"Inside the place, again you could be transported to a time gone by in Andalucia."
"The staff are extremely friendly, but never intrusive."
Seba is always helpful and does his best with his english speaking!
"With almost every drink, you will receive a tapa, not enormous, but enough to make you buy yet another beer for a taste of something different, or to have a full meal later: very clever!"
This really is home cooking of an andalucian style which is difficult to find elsewhere.
"There is so much variety from freshly made pates home made bread, to lentil and pork stews."
"Steaks are wonderful, and some dishes have an argentinian flavour."
"There are a number of set menus, in particular we tried one for 16 euros, which consisted of mixed andalucian cured meats, manchego cheese, olives, freshly made pate and olives."
"Oh, and two generous glasses of well bodied rioja."
"the amount of people who stumble upon here is amazing....I met an older irish couple who stopped by to use the wc, and stayed most of the evening, likewise with a couple of dutch guys who were also impressed!"
"It is so relaxing, it would be easy to sit for the day...and night."
"Our party of 5 had no complaints at all, only compliments."
"La Carihuela has many splendid restaurants, but if you want to try something different from seafood and fish, then I would honestly urge you to try here."
"Take a tip and look out for it, you won't be disappointed."
We had lunch here and my daughter and I simply loved it.
The sauteed mushrooms & asparragus which was one of the specials of the day were fabulous.
We only ate tapas and we were very satisfied.
Highly recommend it
"Certainly not the cheapest tapas, but the quality was high, and servings larger than many other places - so be careful how much you order."
We ended up here three times in our five days in BCN.
"The meats and vegetables dishes were better than the seafood we had (which is not a negative comment on the seafood, but a high compliment to the meat and veggies items)."
This was the ONLY place we got a made to order Spanish Tortilla - delicious.
"The daily specials included some less common items - wild mushrooms, asparagus - wonderful!"
"Good wine list, reasonably priced for a nice tapas restaurant."
"Often crowded and noisy, but still we preferred inside to outside, esp."
since they do not allow smoking inside.
Service was excellent and place is just plain busy and fun.
HIGHLY recommended.
"The first night we went there, absolutely no chance of a table, we went earlier the next night and had to wait 30 mins for a table."
"Well worth the wait, Tapas to die for!"
"Service and atmosphere great, food unbelievable."
"If you get the chance to go there, take it, you won't be sorry."
"Me and my family went to the kudu bar for a meal and thought the food was fabulous, the new owners are lovely people who make you feel welcome and relaxed, a lovely family atmosphere with good priced quality food and a view to die for...an asset to a beautiful area."
Great tapas.
You can pick from menu or from tapas bar.
Prawns brochette were outstanding!
Ate there twice b/c we had such good experience.
Was recommended by a colleague.
A regular haunt for locals and the occasional tourists.
I don't eat seafood however this was not a problem.
Recommend dining at the bar(s) where the action is.
The Jerez restaurant is located next to Ronda's bull ring.
Gets lots of tourist bus traffic.
We've eaten there a couple times.
"Restaurant is loud, service is okay, food is unremarkable."
My biggest pet peeve: They automatically put bread and bottled water on your table.
Then charge you for it later.
This is unacceptable.
We stopped by Mamabels for lunch during our visit to the Mojacar Pueblo in June 2009.
She has the most beautiful view in Mojacar and the white stucco pueblo with blue doors and window shutters is so beautiful.
"We enjoyed our fresh, delicious meal and came to find out the Mamabel has been cooking for 40 years."
"She gave us a tour of her hotel rooms and they are beautiful, each decorated differently and each with a spectacular view."
We will stay with Mamabel during our next trip to Mojacar and look foward to more meals there.
Here lovely dining room and homey touch were so inviting!
Don't miss this one!
"This has to be the real no1, its in the best location, carry on along the front keeping the sea on your left, just past the occidental or cut through between oasislanz club and the albtross theres a walkway between the two and you're there."
the only place in the whole of costa teguise thats actually on the beach.
"they have a fantastic dining area right by the waters edge,ok it can be a bit cold at night, but if i had to sit there in a wolly hat and coat, i would."
"its the best place around, the food is fantastic, the waiters are brilliant, and once they get to know you, they make you feel most welcome and cant do enough for you i love them all {miguel, thomas & eddie} i really cant fault the place what more could anyone want  i was shocked when i went in may 09 to see the other so called no1 resturant, no comparison!!!!"
villa toledo is the no1.
"the only one dissappionting evening we had was when they didnt have enough waiters on, and we had to go upstairs, inside to eat, i was gutted ."
"i love sitting on the waters edge listening to the waves and seeing the night lights accross the bay why no one has bothered to review this place bugs me ,they are talking about it in the forums but no reviews, if there was this place would most certainly be the no 1 try the campange sangria its the best!!!"
also try the tiramasu and see what your plate looks like!!
!
this is the best tapas bar in Spain!
"mouth watering tapas with a reasonable stick price, and the sangria is made to your choice of strength."
"the staff give excellent customer service and is where we head straight to each time we go to Barcelona... and we're spreading the word, as we don't want people to miss out!"
downstairs opens at 1pm and has a great atmosphere and design
This Thai restaurant opened about 15 months ago and the owners Johan and Jeanette are passionate about Thai Food.
Johan is a professional chef who used to live in Koh Samui Thailand and boy does he know how to cook authentic Thai and Indonesian food!!
"He uses only tthe finest and freshest fish, meat and herbs/spices in his wonderfully aromatic creations."
The Thai soups are a meal in themselves and the noodle soup with tofu and mushrooms is sublime and I have to say the best I have ever tasted and that includes those eaten in Thailand.
His spicy noodle mains with either prawns or chicken are delicous as was the fillet of beef red curry stirfry my hubby had.
Just a word of warning though do not order starters and a main unless you have a huge appetite or hollow legs!!
Both Johan and Jeanette are very friendly affable hosts and will make sure you have a memorable meal.
Oh and to top it all it is very reasonably and moderately priced with starters from 3 - 5 euro and mains from 7.5 - 12.5 euro.
Go and enjoy.
"I enjoyed the tapas here very much, because they were not standard at all."
Very nice for a quick lunch and not pricy at all.
The waitresses were a bit rude when I tried to talk English to them (I didn't feel confident here to use my basic Spanish skills).
One of them was talking to me in Spanish while I was talking to the other waitress in English (assuming that I didn't understand her) and asking me if I was a prostitute????
I didn't appreciate this joke very much of course.
"We went to Fonda Caner with quite high hopes, having read some quite good reviews, but also aware that others had been less enthusiastic."
"We were certainly disappointed with each part of our meal, but could see that there is potential."
I think the chef is too ambitious and would do better if the choices and menus were fewer.
"There's an a la carte menu, of course, and (as I recall) 4 other menus."
"Lots of choice, but lots of challenges for the kitchen and too many opportunities for mistakes."
"For example, my first course of salmon ravioli with mushroom was barely warm -- and parts were cold."
"My veal steak was ""blue"", instead of medium rare (but was good meat), and my wife's fish was smothered with too much of a rather cloying sauce."
"What a pity, particularly because, despite the flaws, I feel sure that there's a good chef strugglig to display his talents."
Eight of us went for my fiftyth birthday meal.
"We hadnt booked but they found us a table, ready and laid, in a couple of minutes even though they were busy."
"Food was excelent and tasty, mainy of the mains for arround 6euros."
My half carafe of wine was only 2.80 and not rubbish either.
"The surrounding were great even though we sat downstairs, oldy spanishy."
Service not fast but worth wait and didnt feel like we had to leave.
I would recommend it to everyone especially after being charged 10 euros a drink in many bars and cafes in the centre of town.
Both of my visits have been estupendos!
!
We were looking for somewhere to eat as part of a family celebration in a party of 7.
The Citrus looked really nice and stylish and the menu was really interesting and reasonably priced.
At first it seemed to be fully booked but as we were leaving we were told a table had suddently become available.
"A waiter arrived to take our order for drinks and promptly dissappeared again, Some time later a rather miserable waitress with a severe case for customer service training came to our table and we ordered our drinks."
They arrived but instead of a normal sized bottle we got 2 small bottles and white not red.
We pointed out her mistake and she then stropped off and returned with the correct order only to leave them on the table unopened.
We waited again for some time for her to return and take our food order and open the wine - we had held out all day looking forward to a really nice evening meal.
As we were not massive eaters some of chose not to have a starter.
"Not sure if it is the custom in Spain to deliver all the food at the same time but this meant that some of us had our starters and some the main course all together, The starters were excellent but the mains came just as a plate of meat or occasionally accompanied by a few frites or a small amount of mash potato but none of them had any vegetable accompaniment."
Don't get me wrong the food was very good but as you can imagine we were still quite hungry.
Because of our lack of satisfaction both with the portions and the service we decided to forgo the sweet and left.
All in all we liked the style and the atmosphere was quite good but the service and the lack of anything green on your plate was a real disappointment!
My wife and I spent the first few nights in Soller trying to find a restaurant that offered good local food - nearly all the restaurants around the square offer standard international 'tourist food'.
"It was such a shame that a beautiful little square with a wonderful atmosphere did not seem to have a good, no fuss local restaurant...until we tried the Sa Cova."
It doesn't look much perched on the corner but we ate there two nights in a row once we'd tried it!
The Tapas was the best we had in Soller (and Port Soller) - the Frita Mallorqui fantastic - we saw a couple devour the Paella (the owner had warned them it would be 30 minutes or so because it was cooked fresh).
The Mallorcan Almond Tart was gorgeous too.
"All-in-all, we wished there had been more restaurants like this in Soller - the fact there weren't was the only disappointing aspect of the town."
I liked this restaurant very much.
The menu is a collection of tasty treats from around the region and the members of the staff are friendly and helpful.
It's delightful to sit upstairs and watch the world go by with a delicious meal and some great wine from their reasonably priced list.
Free Way is a super restaurant to dine at in the Forum area of Barcelona.
It is on the terrace level of the Diagonal Mar Mall.
"They offer a buffet that includes salad bar, Chinese food, fresh grilled seafood and meats, and desserts."
"When I visited in June 2009, the prices were only 14Euros per person for dinner!"
The food was fresh and tasty.
"The salad bar consisted of fresh salad ingredients, crab salad, Spanish cheeses, hams, and olives, etc."
"The best part was the grill, where you could choose from a variety of super fresh seafood items and meats and have them grilled to your liking."
We had great fresh shrimp with the heads on and salmon steaks.
"There were a variety of squid, cuttlefish, others types of fish, crayfish, etc."
"Also, you could get grille steak, chicken, and sausages, as well."
"The Chinese section had fried rice, five-spice flavored spare ribs, fried spring rolls, and ""Chinse donuts""."
"The dessert bar had fresh (local) and canned (Asian) fruits, as well as several types of cake, and heavenly flan."
"Drinks such as soda, wine, or espresso concoctions cost extra but are not pricey for the area."
The server was super attentive and knew when to come at the right moment so as to not interrupt conversations.
"Free Way was the best restaurant hands down in terms of flavor, service, and value that I encountered in Barcelona."
Highly recommended!
We had an excellent dinner at Monte Christo's.
"We did the have Ceasar's salad with shrimps, followed by Saltimboca a la Romana."
My wive finished with a Tiramisu and I took an expresso.
"Service was outstanding, friendly and with great efficiency."
The wine list is good : we took a sparkling rosada pinot noir.
"The total cost per person was 50 euro, which was an excellent value taking into consideration the quality of the food."
"I can highly recommended this Italian restaurant, you will not be disappointed."
There were plenty of dishes for the pasta lovers.
"We had some difficulty in locating the restaurant, this is why I post the adress : Calle Bruselas, Playa Fanabe, in front of the Bahia Princess Hotel."
"While stroling around the area, we sat in the little terrace and ended up ordering the lunch menu."
"I had an extremely tasty risotto, and my bf had some kind of tomato salad which he loved; the main courses (the hamburguer is very cooly presented) were also great, high above the usual standards for lunch menus."
Service was nice but not very efficient but hey what else can you ask for a 10 euro menu in that area?
!
"If you are going to Barcelona and are walking around in the old part of the city, you have to visit this place."
"The food was good, reasonable prices and a nice staff."
"Tucked away off an alley in the old town, it's worth finding for the excellent fresh fish, simply cooked and good value."
Nice old interior and a few tables outside.
Small and friendly.
Dined here at end of May.Sat outside on edge of Soller's gorgeous horseshoe bay.
Staff & food delightful but service very poor.I think they forgot about us several times & they got my main course order wrong.
Maybe they just had a bad night-it was very windy.
"Food was pretty good, not too pricey for what we had (Lamb kebab and Fajitas about €10 each) bar is trendy and smart, did see a cockroach scurry up the wall but it is spain!"
"Nice relaxed layout and colourful interior, cocktails look very nice but didnt try."
As usual with most places in Barcelona service wasnt fantastic but better than a lot of places.
"Popular with tourists but not representative of local cuisine since its more med and mex themed, overall though satisfied."
A traditional Spanish restaurant familial.
Very good service and good food in the medium price.
This is a good restaurant with dishes that a reasonably priced but nothing special.
I had made a reservation for May 31st in large part on the recomendation of a friend of a friend who lives in Granada and who said this was one of the best in town.
"The bar area was busy, a good sign, and I guess I had expectations of something special."
I can't fault the service and as previously noted the food was fine but nothing about the restaurant portion of this place seemed anything out of the ordinary.
It was certainly not my fovorite restaurant in Granada.
"I live in Granada an have always been a great fan of this place, but in my last 2 visits in a timeline of 1 year I've noticed how the place has hugely decreased the quality and the variety offered."
"No doubt this used to be maybe the best restaurant in Granada, but nowadays the dishes seem a little apathetic and certainly are not worth the high prices."
My wife and I just returned from our first vacation in Barcelona.
What a fabulous city.
So much to offer.
I selected this restaurant for two reasons.
"Firstly because of the reviews and secondly because it was open on Sunday, a hard day to find an open good restaurant in Barcelona."
The restaurant fulfilled the second part in that it was open on Sunday.
"However, regarding the dining experience itself, it was very, very disappointing."
"The maitre'd was very nice, but the service in general was very amateurish."
"The food was disappointing in that it was tasteless, very average, and certainly not favorably remembered."
"As for the atmosphere, you sit on a street level terrace/sidewalk adoining a local park and the back of houses surrounding the park."
"Not too bad, but not the most romantic or enjoyable either."
"I guess the best that can be said about our experience at this restaurant is that it gave us a place to eat on Sunday, although we will be sure to find a muchbetter place when we return to Barcelona."
I decided on a whim to go to Basmati for dinner tonight and it was one of the best meals I've had in Spain and one of the best Indian meals I've ever had!
"They don't have an a la carte dining option and instead have 2 different types of pre-set menus...I chose the smaller of the 2 which was an appetizer, kabob and 2 different curries (you have a choice between 4), followed by dessert and tea (oh, and wine)...all for 20 Euros!"
It was AMAZING!
I was so full and every bite tasted terrific and they served the best Naan I've ever had (filled with fruit and honey)!
"The waiters so very friendly, spoke great English, and explained every dish to you...It was very obvious that they truely love and pride themselves on their Indian cuisine!"
"If you're even thinking about having Indian while you're in Palma, you MUST go to Basmati."
We went to the hotel Mariposa for a trip across the Sierra Espuna in quad bikes.
In with the quad biking came a 4 course meal.
The location is stunning - I sat in a beautiful court yard restaurant while my husband and kids went out on the bikes.
The hotel is owned by an english family and the food was brilliant.
We will definately be returning when we are over next month.
"However, I would advise you to book in advance - the restaurant was fully booked for lunch the day we went."
The cab driver recommended this restaurant to eat paella and fish.
My daughter had the paella which she loved and I had a whole fish (lenguado) which they debone for you and it was excellent and very tasty.
It was a very relaxing atmosphere as we sat outside and you could see the beach.
"Service was ok, but what matters most which is the food we really enjoyed"
"We were looking forward to eating here so much, but were bitterly disappointed."
We enjoy good food... this was overpriced and not of particularly good quality.
Despite being first in we were sat right by the door and had to overcome the flamboyant welcome given by the hostess to every other diner but a distinctly smelly odour from outside.
Yje staff were attentive but that was about it.
Now the bit the hostess will remember me for if she reads this...
I found metal from a pan scourer in my main dish... apologies followed and a glass of free port and that was it...
VERY DISAPPOINTED
We visited this restaurant in the summer and had the pleasure of being seated in their very sweet terrace.
We both very much enjoyed our meals.
I ordered from the specials and had scallops to start and Rosini steak.
Very nice wine.
From what i remember the bill for the 2 of us was around 65 euros.
Booking advisable.
We had booked for 8 and ours was the only table left!
"Wonderful whole wheat croissants (""croissant integrale""), but the server made us feel pretty unwelcome."
Los Diamantes is a tiny - blink and you'll miss it - local watering hole and tapas bar hidden on a bustling street full of touristy restaurants.
"The scrumptious smell of fried seafood, ubiquituous in Granada, is almost intoxicating on Calle Navas."
"If your attitude to good food is anything like mine, don't be surprised if it has a pavlovian effect on you."
"It certainly made me jiggle on the spot with anticipation and go ""mmmm!"
"mmmm!""."
"This place was recommended by Lonely Planet as ""reason enough to go to Granada"" (I wholeheartedly agree, with the caveat that the Alhambra is, of course, the top reason to go to Granada, followed by a soak and massage in the excellent arab baths - Aljibe de San Miguel)."
"The crowded, noisy, bar looked quite daunting at first but we boldly strode in, still clutching our Lonely Planet."
"We stood our ground and found a small space by the corner of the bar reasonably easily, considering the circumstances."
"Luckily we had brushed up on our spanish food words and were ready to order such tasty tapas as ""almejas"" (clams), ""gambas planchas"" (grilled prawns) and ""chipirones fritas"" (deep fried baby cuttlefish)."
The lady standing beside me was much amused.
"She pointed at our Lonely Planet which we hastily stowed, ""Is this place in the book?"""
I had no choice but to confirm this.
"""The food is very bad."
"I live in Granada and I never come here,"" she said with a mock frown."
"""Don't tell your friends about this place, ok?"""
said her gentleman friend.
We laughed at the joke but I knew there was real worry under the smiles.
"As is the practice in Granada, we got a complimentary plate of tapas with our cervezas to start."
"It was a generous portion of pulpo (octopus) which my boyfriend, who does not like octopus, wolfed down faster than you could say ""I thought you didn't like octopus""."
The food did not disappoint.
"The clams were small and sweet (the way they should be), the prawns fresh and garlicky, the cuttlefish juicy, their tentacles crunchy."
We resolved to go there again the next night.
"The entire meal, with 3 beers and bread, came up to slightly over 30 euros."
"I left wishing I could bring all my friends to Los Diamantes, partly for selfish reasons - so that we would be able to order a greater variety of tapas to try as two dinners at this excellent tapas bar really wasn't enough."
"Gavamar is a wealthy neighbourhood of Barcelona 12km away from the city center, pines, sandy beaches and very quiet."
El Torreon has an amazing location and superb decoration for a mediterranean cuisine restaurant.
"perhaps prices are a little bit hihg, but portions are generous."
Do not miss the desserts.
Situated up a side ride directly opposite the Cathedral on Gran Via del Colon.
Follow the noise to this very busy bar.
You will struggle to find a seat and table but do as the locals do and just order a drink and await your tapas.
"I have had a variety of tapas such as, paella, iberian ham, tuna, prawns and tortilla."
There is a menu available to order from.
As a previous poster put the cold cheese/meat dish is very good.
Situated on the main N332 road and opposite the Torrehoven Hotel this may be the only genuine spanish restaurant in the area.
"Park in the Punta Marina commercial centre and the restaurant is just outside, near McDonalds."
Flamenco dancing Thursdays and Sundays (booking recommended) but wonderful atmosphere any night with seranading guitarists touring the tables throughout the evening.
I've eaten here four or five times now and make a point of visiting here and Villamartin every time I'm staying in the area.
Food is o.k.
without being exceptional and a little unusual e.g.
rabbit always seems to be on the menu and the staff are very friendly but theatmosphere is the main selling point.
"Worth mentioning, however, is that I've seen many spanish people eating here unlike other restaurants nearby which is perhaps a recommendation in itself."
"Hard to find, but worth it."
My wife and I ate lunch at Can Culleretes while spending a week in Barcelona.
"It is very authentic, both in atmopshere, service, and food."
We really enjoyed ourselves.
"The food was very good, and and the menu offers many very traditional local dishes."
"The service was by friendly, effecient waitresses who, I would guess, have been serving there since it first opened."
And the price was more than reasonable.
The best place to have dinner at Costa del Sol.
"We enjoyed very much the food (has one Michelin Star but prices are very rasonable, you can eat a wonderful meal for 60€) enjoying also the wonderful place: it is in the Club House of a Golf Course in front of a lake with nice sea views."
We spend one week in an appartments of the golf course and we have dinner at El lago 3 nights and for 2 more nights (that we were tired after coming from trips we order a take away for the apartments!!
Very convinient!
We enjoyed very much our stay there
We found the waitstaff to be very rude here.
We were given an already opened bottle of water that had a strange ring around it as if it was half empty and later topped off with fresh water.
When we asked for a new bottle the rudeness began and lasted throughout our meal.
We felt a cold shoulder from the staff and we heard comments from a staff member in Spanish as we exited about hating Americans.
"The atmosphere, building, and it's history would be the only reason to visit, otherwise I would suggest not bringing your service to this establishment."
A very elegant restaurant in which you are treated very professionally.
"The food is good, but the service is amazing."
All things are done by two very well trained waiters and make each item seem like a ballet.
They are very friendly and the whole dining experience is extremely memorable and enjoyable.
"The place looks promising and cozy and trendy, so we were fooled."
"But I guess people who ate there weren't familiar with Japanese noodles in the first place, so they'll just like the unique taste."
"But me and my friends can swear to God that they're just instant noodles, the ones that are usually sold in supermarkets in Asia."
"There are only 2 waiters serving a full house, so we have to wait for quite some time."
"But at least, the waiters are decent."
They really make sure that you are not seated with a stranger.
"Because there is one guy waiting alone, and the three of us were seated together and the lonely guy had to wait longer."
"Try the ""Good roll"" and/or ""Very Good roll""."
They try to make sushi with vermicelli instead of rice.
"Now that is unique for us, because we had tried all different kinds of sushi, but none of them had been made with vermicelli."
"Great noodle dishes for lunch, not very cheap but also not expensive."
It might not be very authentic but definetly very good food.
And really nice interior design.
This was a totally over-rated and disappointing experience.
Went here with a large group of ladies - had to wait until 8 pm until the restaurant opened WHY????
(and not because of numbers cos we were at the head of the queue0 The whole experience was a waste of time.
The service was abominable - the staff were overstretched and as a result rude and unhelpful - especially one waitress who was particularly rude and unpleasant.. Out of 14 people only 2 people enjoyed their meal.
The paella I had was tasteless and full of ingredients that I wouldn't normally expect in a paella (chipolata sausage and fatty pork - only 2 prawns).
As a group we decided that there would be no tip - it definitely wasn't deserved.
Don't waste your time queing.
Just don't go (Sinatra's just around the corner was much better although a bit pricey for drinks).
We saw the line forming at this restaurant for several nights while we were dining in other restaurants on Placa Reial & decided we had to try it.
"To start off we ordered a liter of Sangria (7,62e)."
"He had the vegetable soup (4,21e)...really delicious."
"I had the ham appetizer (8,04e)."
"I ordered the lamb (10,23e)...tasty & it fell off the bone & he ordered a cod plate (8,93e)...he liked my lamb better."
"Odd prices, but very reasonable."
"Total 41,76e without tip."
We decided to go there again...This time she brought 2 rolls (90e).
"I asked for butter & she brought 2 pats (1,76e)."
We both ordered the vegetable soup...it has a crispy piece of ham in it.
"He ordered the lamb & I ordered the stuffed chicken (6,87e)...lamb was the better choice!"
The sangria was a bargain at 7.62e since we had been paying 15e at other restaurants in Placa Reial.
"Total 41,76e without tip."
Both times we were seated inside...our choice since it was cooler in the evenings.
Nice surroundings....good service (they do not rush you)....excellent prices & a good night out.
This is not gourmet food as the prices reflect.
It is decent food at a decent price in a good atmosphere.
The line starts forming about 8 pm.
They open at 8:30 pm.
There is a smoking room inside.
Go there!
Excellent Italian in Valencia.
"Good service, good price, nice location."
"Like this one so much ate here 3 out of 5 lunchtimes, cleared our plates every time and my daughter is fussy!!!"
Good value daily menu at 8.95.
"Absolutely superb, great food, excellent setting by the sea and outstanding service."
"Well worth a visit, seafood (Mussells magnificent)"
I went this week with a group of friends of mine to this place for some food and drinks.
One of us had hit his head on the way to the restaurant and was bleeding and needed a plaster.
"The staff flatly denied that they had any, unbelievable."
The food tasted awful and the staff were very rude.
Considering this is a prime tourist spot it was surprising that none of them spoke any English (or German).
"If you can, avoid this place or limit yourself to the drinks service to the loungers."
We mostly ordered the pizzas and the yummy garlicky shrimp and avocado green salad.
The tiramisu is good too.
Il Forno is right off the Alameda Hercules.
It has an open kitchen which always seems like a plus to me.
"It was usually bustling by 10pm, so we tried to get there closer to 9 since we have 2 little kids who don't improve the ambiance if we have to wait too long for dinner."
"We went here in June 2009 for dinner, and both had quite the best steak in a long time, I can still remember the taste even now when holiday seems like an age ago!"
"The service was incredibly polite and attentive, and the atmosphere relaxed with interesting decor and a historic feel."
"Unfortunately, the restaurant was very quiet, which we hope was just due to it being low season, as we would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Jerez"
"Not a great fan of fish myself, and this is a fish restaurant."
The clue is in the name.
"My meal was, however, incredible."
Love the little tasters they bring you when you arrive and nice to see they didnt pop up on our bill at the end!
Wonderful wine - but boy do they like to charge for it!
Fascinating decor though perhaps a little cold.
I would recommend to fish lovers.
"For non fish lovers there are, from what i remember, other meat dishes available but this possibly defeats the object."
"I had the foie gras, suckling pig, some cheese and desert."
It was really an outstanding meal with excellent service.
I was very pleased and happy to spend the money I did.
I'd go here again in a heart beat.
"A terrific place -- if you like ""modern"", slightly ""whacky"" food; e.g."
"""Foie Gras After Eight"" (foie gras, with a mint foam and grated chocolate), which was delicious -- as was every part of the Taster menu which we had."
"The room is modern and quite stark, but attracive and comfortable."
"The staff, delightful ladies, were charming and efficient."
A great meal which we enjoyed enormously.
Earlier in the year I had planned to propose to my girlfriend in Madrid.
I had desperatly been looking for a perfect restaurant to have dinner after I proposed.
I had booked a few highly recommended places only to be called by the restaurant to tell me that they were not open because it was Easter weekend.
I finally decided to call El Paraguas a couple of hours before the big moment.
Initially they told me they were booked out but I pleaded with them and when I told them my proposal plans they decided to accomodate me.
I am so glad that they did becuase it was the most perfect meal for that occasion that I could have hoped for.
It was a huge relief becuase I wanted it to be special and it was.
The staff were soooo good to us and the food was exceptional.
The best value I have ever come accross.Though I do like in Dublin which is very expensive.
"Having dined here quiet a few times i feel compelled to write a few lines about this little gem,it is without a doubt the best place to eat on the island,and a trip here is highly recomended.The food is lovingly prepared by Juan who prides himself on using top quality locally sourced produce and served to you by Peter who himself takes as much pride in his work as juan does in the kitchen.I have been on holidays here four times in the last two years and my memories of this restaurant will stay with me only to be out done by new ones when i visit this wonderfull establishment again."
This is by far the best restaurant in Gran Canaria.
Minanas Chill Out Restaurant is as described in the name; a please where you can relax and enjoy your food in a quiet atmosphere.
"I will say that the restaurant is in the borderline between high class and local, cozy tavern, meaning that:  - The food is always best quality fresh bought meat, fish and vegetables from the marked."
"Therefore it can happen that they run out of certain things on the menu, if you are arriving late."
"- The etiquette is not as in a normal ""snobbish"" restaurant."
"The waiter has clearly not had any training in this field, but you can see that he is doing his best to please all the customers, in spite of he forgetting that you are suppose to taste the wine before he fills up the glasses to everyone."
But this again is the part of the charm of the restaurant.
"Minanas Restaurant keeps the same price level as the other restaurants in the same area, but the value of the that price is so much more."
"My favorite is ""The sole file in lemon sauce"", ""The leg of lamb with a lot of rosemary"", and the ""Minanas steak"""
I read alot of reviews on this place before I went so booked a table on-line and when me and my mates went there for food we were not dissapointed the food was great the atomsphere was relaxed and juan the chef was so nice that when my partner did not like the soup he was not happy that she had left it so offered to cook her another soup not so strong well worth going as I ended up going there 3 time in the fortnight I was there NOT TO BE MISSED as the three course for 9euros is a brilliant offer for the quality of the food
Over the last few years my partner and I have visited this restaurant on several occasions.
You are always assured a warm welcome from Fredric & Marie and the wonderful food is second to none.
Have recommended this delightful place to all our friends who have been equally impressed.
We had heard from so many people that this restaurant was worth a visit - so we took an afternoon off... and headed into town.
I have to say that I was very disappointed.
The satay was cold... the duck was way overcooked... and it was not until we were given our bill that we were asked how the food was.
Maybe we simply caught them on a bad day - but they certainly weren't busy.
The waitress was surly too.
"In our experience here in Playa Blanca, Chinese food isn't as good as in the UK."
"However... the ""New Brilliant"" in Punta Limones is good for takeaway."
"Just steer clear of anything with noodles, as the oil here leaves things quite greasy."
We also booked this restaurant before we went on holiday.
About 2 months before.
When we were in Cala D'or we had to cancel the reservation due to unforseen circumsatances.
"We went out of our way to cancel, first e-mailing unsuccesfully and then getting the hotel to phone the restaurant."
The restaurant said that was ok.
"When we got back home and checked our e-mails, there was one from the restaurant saying that a wedding was booked for the night of our meal and would we like to try another night!"
This was sent on 4th june - we left for Cala D'or on 1st june!
Surely they must have had more than 2 days notice for a wedding.
I wish we hadn't bothered trying to contact them as their customer service is shocking.
I came to Abaco for an after-dinner drink and I was very impressed.
Their mixed drinks seemed a bit pricey but I had a glass of wine and paid 6 Euros...not bad!
"The place is amazing-looking, with candles, fresh flowers and fruit decorating the place!"
The waiters were nice to me and I had a very relaxed experience.
"It's definitely worth coming into, at least for a cocktail!"
"We always look for the ""Routard"" stickers on the window or door to see which restaurants are worthy or not, and this one had a window-full of them, going back many years!"
And the cuisine was not disappointing.
There are so many restaurants along the main boulevards that just offer the same old same old.
Can Solé offers excellent Catalan and Mediterranean dishes.
The wine list is very good as well.
This is definitely one of the places to try when down at the port.
"We have had a small company dinner in this restaurant, very friendly stuff, fair prices and great food, spicey and almost like in Thailand."
Lot better than Thai Gardens which only have appearance.
Menu had lots of appeal and food was memorable.
"Service was effecient - English no problem, (our waitress was Japanese!)."
Would certainly go again.
Took the plunge and tried this restaurant after reading about it on TripAdvisor.
We went at 9PM and were seated immediately.
They have english and spanish menus which makes it easier to order.
The wait staff seemed extremely busy and certainly was unable to provide any level of personal service.
The food was awesome and well presented.
The time for it to arrive was minimal as well.
"Best of all, most entrees were around 8 euros, making it one of the more reasonably priced restaurants in the area."
When we left there were easily 30 people waiting in line for a table.
"I dined in Zodiaco last week - we chose from the menu of the day (you must ask for this menu, it will probably not be given to you initially, and is not available on Saturday or Sunday) and it was superb."
We also had a bottle of house white which was absolutely fine.
"The total cost for three courses for 2 people, with coffees and the bottle of wine was 40 euros."
Fantastic value and really really good food.
Highly recommended.
What a wonderful way to end a stay in Barcelona.
"The atmosphere is decoish, which is my fave and elegant, though it doesn't demand formal dress."
Tons of mirrors and quiet in spite of the number of diners there.
"The food we ordered was excellent, though except for the dizzingly perfect chocolate truffles I can't remember what I ordered."
It may come back to me when the jet lag fades.
Cafe de L Academia was one of the best restaurants we went to in Barcelona.
The food was pretty good except some dishes were very salty.
The slow cooked lamb was tender and flavorful and the pasta in another dish was very fresh.
"However, the monkfish was very salty and hard to enjoy."
"Overall, we had a pleasant visit."
We spotted this restaurant with its outdoor tables in a charming square as we wandered round the Old City and subsequently found it recommended in our guide book so we thought we would take the risk of turning up without reservation (it was a Thursday) when it was due to open at 2030 that evening.
By the time it did open a few minutes late there was a small crowd gathered but despite not having a reservation we got in.
"The decor inside was as charming as the exterior and the food excellent - a plate of little toasts with goat's cheese and anchovies for starter, rack of lamb and two small hamburgers for main courses."
The service was efficient but slightly impersonal.
"We didn't see the staff offer any physical violence to the customers, however."
Another commentator refers to tapas - these may be available at lunch but do not form part of the evening menu.
I went to Barcelona last may with 3 friends and we went to this restaurant that my sister recomended us.
We had a nice time there.
"The food is divine, the staff is very nice treating people."
I'd recomend you to try the one pallilo menu for the first time.
Went there with my wife & baby daughter 2 weeks ago.
I asked the bartender if they had were open and had availability.
I was told they had so and wait outside 5 minutes until they opened.
I was also told that I could not use their bathrooms to change my 13 month old baby until the restaurant opened.
My wife & baby sat on the outside table in the courtyard while I went back to our hotel room for 30 minutes.
"When I returned they were waiting on a stoop by the church, they were asked to move as they had no reservtion."
"The restaurant was open 1/2 hr, most of outside was still practically empty, inside was completely empty."
Dispite the very rude treatment by the bartender we were really hungry and I asked about a table inside and the bartender offered me their tiniest table (I told him I needed room for the baby stroller).
I took the restraurant card & told him I'd hold on to it to reccomend to my friends NOT to go there.
I was the pushed on the ground by the bartender.
He pushed me out the door while a number of other staff & passerbys pushed him off me.
Why does the restaurant employ staff who attacks customers?
"I would strongly recommend a visit to the Restaurant Estrellas de San Nicholas, just to the left of the Mirador in the Albaycin."
"The view of the Alhambra is gorgeous, the food is very good and the service is charming."
"Try the Aubergine strips served with a honey sauce, its delicious !"
We have just returned from a few days in Costa Dorada; while there we visited a little bar called the Brown Bear.
This was actually a little gem.
"It is located just off one of the main roads in Salou, near the bus stop-backing onto the prom."
The reason we choose to eat here was because we weren't hassled to come in while we were passing but when we did decide the staff we very welcoming.
"This was a lovely pavement style bar, with Bear's everywhere!"
We enjoyed lunch here one day: 15.00 Euros for 3 toasted sandwiches & 3 cokes which I though to be very reasonable.
"The food was lovely, the surroundings clean & the staff very attentive."
Would return next time we're in Salou....many thanks!
Very busy and not pretentious.
Very good value food.
The pork knuckle was not good but the meat generally is fine.
Try the pork chops if they are on the menu.
The puddings are good and cheap enough.
"If you are in the centre of Palma and looking for a straightforward meal to fill an hour or two, this is the place to head for."
Loved the clams steamed in garlic and white wine!
Delicious!
We sat outside and enjoyed the day.
We dined at AbAC while staying in Barcelona prior to a Mediterranean Cruise.
We consider ourselves to be foodies to some degree.
I thought the dining room and place settings were gorgeous and the staff was so friendly.
Every person really took pride in what they did.
The host was especially attentive to us.
I think he was trying to make us feel comfortable because we were the only Americans.
He escorted us to all the different areas and checked on us several times.
We opted for the Chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed.
We have dined at The French Laundry and this tasting menu was definitely just as good as the tasting menu at The French Laundry.
"Unfortunately, I am late in writing this review, so I cannot remember all of the courses."
"After dinner, we were escorted to the lounge for cocktails."
Talk about top shelf liquor selections!
It was a great way to cap off a great dinner!
"I think the total bill for 2 came to $400, so it is not a cheap meal, but I think it is more than worth it."
The atmosphere is absolutely stunning and extremely elegant.
That is where the exceptionality ends.
The waiter dropped two pieces of flatware on me and thought it was very amusing.
Each course of the special tasting menu came floating in liquid.
Maybe it was the chef's night off.
We had to request refills of water and the wine for our final entree never arrived.
The manager tried to be accomodating by serving us some desert wine and then some sherry and petit fors which never arrived!
We could hear him screaming in the kitchen after our complaints--he did reduce our bill and was extremely embarrassed.
"The first thing you'll notice in this place is the utter silence, the mobile service trays are terry cloth lined and the rooms just soak up the normal sounds of a restaurant."
"The staff is well trained, very formal and on point throughout service."
The sommelier is equally attentive and stayed with my table and our bottle throughout dinner.
Now to the food - it is exceptional but not other-worldly.
"Often of the El Bulli-school with far less pretense, it is very, very good - but not life changing as the price, atmosphere and appearance of service would suggest."
"Worth a one shot, beautiful grounds and hotel location."
Try the tasing menu and bring a fat wallet.
I dropped Euro 200/person.
Myself & my partner ate in Poco Loco 3 times last week.
"I cant understand the previous reviews, unless maybe there has been a change of owner or chef??"
I ate in 5th Ave aswell.
Found the steaks in both places very good.
Poco Loco was very reasonable for anyone on a budget.
"We had 2 starters, 2 main courses, 1 dessert & 3 drinks, & with tips never went over the €50 mark."
"Great location, great food, value & staff."
We loved it
Cannot fault this restaurant at all.
"The service was great, orders were taken quickly and starters arrived within a few minutes."
My partner had sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly for him.
"We visited twice in a week, the first time I had a pizza which was huge and tasted great."
The second time i had grilled chicken in pepper sauce which was gorgeous.
Extensive menu catering for any taste.
A must when in Corralejo.
"Have heard mixed reviews on this place but after two trips to Fuerteventura, we ate here about four or five times in total and every time the food was excellent."
We always had the prawns in garlic (and oil) which are fab.
Tried several of the meat entrees which were all very good and perfectly cooked.
They do great food for children - you can order 1/2 portions of the main meals so the kids can eat great food - not processed chicken nuggets!
Ours loved the grilled chicken breast and canary potatoes!
Pretty average Italian place in a sidestreet to the Denia main street.
"Food good enough, prices ok."
"The owner is very enthusiastic, and it's a safe place to eat, if not spectacular"
We stayed at the nearby Regencia Colon and ate here twice in three nights.
The restaurant looked a bit snooty and they turned us away from an empty dining room as we didn't have a reservation on our first visit.
So we sat at the bar and gorged ourselves on tapas.
The service was great and we got to watch lots of different things being prepared.
The bar prices were reasonable compared to the dining room and everything we had was very well prepared.
"I would definitely go back, and hope they were serving razor clams that night."
I have been here at least 8 times.
I generally have the same thing because to be honest there is never much else on their menu that i fancy!
Chiken livers to start which is gorgeous as is the prawn curry.
I think the prices are fantastic as is the decor and ambiance.
"The staff are always friendly, except one - who also i believe to be the manager."
We have had a bad experience there.
Not their fault - the cooker had broke down.
But no one called to warn us - infact we werent even told that over 60% of meals on the menu were unavailable until we came to order.
"I wont go into too much detail but cutting a long story short we ended up not ordering and leaving not because of the lack of food but for the ""well if you dont like it , go somewhere else"" attitude."
Having said that - i would probably go back.
Visited this restaurant on a few occasions as a couple and with grown up children.
"The staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful."
The food was excellent and service good.
It is a little bit more expensive that the restaurants down the road but worth it.
My wife and I spent an afternoon at this outdoor tapas bar two last week.
"It was our first time in Barcelona, but there will be many more."
And many more afternoons at Taller de Tapas in Placa Sant Josep.
"This ""workshop"" of tapas serves everything you could ask for, in the most casaul and friendly and helpful manner."
Just a delightful way to sit after a lot of tour walking and spend an afternoon in Barcelona.
"After an exhausting first day in Barcelona, a friend led us through the maze of the old city to TALLER DE TAPAS at Comtal 28 (Via Laietana) Barcelona Tel."
93 481 62 33.
"As a Celiac, I was greatly relieved to find the restaurant manager was very familiar with gluten content of food and was able to offer me to many choices."
"The staff were less familiar, but accomodating."
"We had an assortment of items: grouper, chick peas and spinach, gazpacho, chicken kebabs, steak, salads, and chocolate deserts."
All were wonderful.
"Oh-one more thing, the price was great for for what we got."
"We ate there 2 of our 4 nights in Barcelona, and would have been happy to eat there every night."
We read about this Tapas chain in a Frommer's book.
We ate dinner at the one in the Barri Gotic neighborhood.
You could sit outside under umbrellas and enjoy people watching or sit inside the restaurant.
We chose to sit inside for the air conditioning and found ourselves at a tiny table squished among other patrons.
"The service was fair, but not the best."
We should have sat outside.
"This was our last dinner in Barcelona, so we had sampled tapas from many other restaurants by this point."
We were delightfully surprised by the menu as it contained many tapas we had not yet encountered.
"The food was fresh, well prepared, and elegantly arranged."
I especially enjoyed the grilled asparagus and green beans that were served with a delicious tangy sauce.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
I used the reviews here to find a good Steak restaurant when I was in Barcelona.
"""Best Steak in Europe"" is what I read elsewhere."
This could not be further from the truth.
"The staff were rude, condescending, and smoking in the main restaurant."
"The decor, old and dated."
Prices: Expensive.
Food: Average at best.
A very disappointing evening.
AVOID.
Found this place on the web and took a chance.
"It's tiny, down a side street, opens at 8PM and is total heaven for carnivores."
"We ate the gorgonzola beef and the beef pimento and it melted our souls.... Also had ""Sangre del Toro"" wine which was the perfect compliment."
"If there weren't so many other restaurants to try, we would have eaten here every night."
Coming to Sitges for the last 20 years I only discovered this restraurant 5 years ago.
Pity it's the best fish restaurant in Sitges and probably in the whole area.
Try hard and you may find it.
Up and over the church and museum area down into San Sebastian bay.
Find the tiny park with the small statue and you're almost there.
In the evening it opens about 9.30pm and will often be full - mainly well heeled locals.
"Their dishes are based on what they've caught but the sole, the hake are superb."
If you can afford the turbot you'll know why they call it the King of fish.
It;s all plainly cooked in oil and well salted - no sauces - no specials - charming non-English speaking service.
Their Fideua is an example to others but only at lunchtime.
Portions are big - I go for one starter between two.
What's fresh is key so it's not open Sunday or Monday night.
"Other things, well, the wine list is excellent and very high quality."
They won't offer you a gin and tonic but if you want one ask and you'll get a killer ice cold G&T to relax you.
Oh and they'll cook you a fabulous steak but fish is the thing here.
"nice decor, and good food for the price."
Visited this restaurant yesterday... would recommend it highly.... a great menu... friendly service.... near Barcelona Universal Hotel.
We will be back!
Cal Pep is a hidden treasure.
"Don't let the size of the place fool you as ""it's not quantity but quality."""
The food is fresh and I believe that is what brings people back.
"Despite the queue one must stand on, it's worth the wait."
It gives you the opportunity to check out what others are eating.
"When my husband and I were seated, Cal, himself came over and said in Spanish that he'd order for us."
"By all means, that was an honor for us!"
We were so excited about thee Cal selecting our menu.
We did not know what was in store for us.
"To make a long story short, everything was delicious: the artichokes, clams, prawns, monkfish and the dessert was amazing!"
The dessert was like a creme brulee.
It really put the finishing touch on a wonderful meal.
Nice staff who are extremely helpful!
"Despite the queue, never once did we feel like they rushed us."
Would go back in a heartbeat!
Author's cuisine at really low price.
"Albert, the chef, is also an amazing person!"
Excellent!
!
Had lunch at this hard to find spot and while the food was fine I don't see what all the raves are about.
"Small place and very crowded in the bar area, to much so for my taste."
Food and prices were fine but I don't know why anyone would wait 30 or 40 minutes to get in as so many do.
I also do not get what is special about the atmosphere of the place - many not so different on the same square.
Cant fault the food and the service is very good also.
"When we went it was the off season which had a strange effect on the place, basically it was full of Brits and Germans that had retired to the island."
On the one hand thats great because its obviously repeat custom and confirmation that its nice food but on the other hand it did have something of the old people's home about it ;0)  Basically perfect for anyone who lives on the island but if you want something a bit more lively in the off season then maybe drop in for a drink first to see if the place is your scene or not
"fantastic pizza made to order and pasta dishes, real italian syle not frozen bulk buy pizza's cooked"
"We had a bit of a hard time finding the place, but once we did, we enjoyed delicious beet soup, lasagna, well-cooked piece of salmon, interesting ice cream (no clue what the flavor was)."
"I don't know what the dinner prices are, but the lunch was definitely not over-priced."
Had dinner at this restaurant on our last night in Seville and thought it was as good a meal as we had during our three weeks in Spain.
"Dinning room is on the second floor and is quite elegant, a place you might want to put on a coat and tie for though none is required."
We had a bottle of wine with dinner and shared a desert and the total bill was approximately 100 euros.
"The service was good and while we had reservations I don't think any would be required, at least if you arrive before 9:15."
Their were a number of separate rooms and things picked notably around ten pm.
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an elegant meal and were I to return to Seville I would certainly try lunch as well as dinner at this fine restaurant.
This El Palo staple is ear-splittingly noisy.
"It is impossible to hold a conversation-- the waiters cruise by, yelling their wares, and the noise ricochets off every surface."
"The clientele is there for a loud, good time, so no releif from the folks at the next table."
"If you want theatre, there's plenty of it, and the fish is as fresh as anywhere in Malaga."
"I suggest going with a large, rowdy group of friends, and with someone who can identify the truly impressive array of seafood."
Enjoyed the lamb chops but the shrimp omelet was overly fried.
Made a 10:30 reservation just hours before dinner on a Saturday night.
The meal was amazing and service was helpful.
We sat at a hightop table near the bar - it was a very lively scene.
Very cool experience.
"The tapas were amazing - the razor clams to die for, the giant live oyster was amazing, the bombes - I could go on forever."
A definite spot to hit in Eixample.
And it is near a lot of great bars for a post-dinner drink.
The place was recommended by the concierge of our hotel and we loved it!
Actually we came back a second time because the food was so great.
Everything we tasted was outstanding.
"The service is great, really friendly and fast."
"As the place is usaually crowded, expect some waiting time."
"It is surely not the cheapest tapas place, but surely worth the money"
"Don´t miss ""El capricho de seitan"", the ""Vegeburger"" are great, the cakes superb, specially banana cake, my favorite."
"White wine is also good, and Vegetalia has a selection of organic beers."
"This cosy place is one of my favorites in Barcelona, even if you are not vegetarian you can find the food lovely."
In summer they have a terrace outside.
Beautiful old style bar.
Incredibly clean for Madrid standards.
Cañas are very well served in frozen 20 cl glasses.
If you order nothing else from this restaurant order the pizza (8 or 9 Euro).
The first time we dined there we ordered a pizza each.
They have a good selection & they are a good size.
We went back again and split a pizza & sangria and both had the Panacotta for desert (4.75 Euro)...delicious!
"The next time we ordered the Grissini & olive tapenade (3 Euro) and the Cannelloni Rossini..pasta stuffed with Bolognese (12 Euro), a liter of Sangria (15 Euro) and for desert the Profiterole for me...big portion & very good (4.50 Euro) and the Tiramisu for him (5.50 Euro)...really tasty!"
"For our last night in Barcelona we went back & ordered the Melon with Ham (5.50 Euro) the Spaghetti Bolognese (11 Euro), Eggplant Parmesan (11.50 Euro), a Pepsi (2.50 Euro) a glass of red wine (4 Euro) & a shot of Sambuca (3 Euro)."
We sat at an outside table.
The service is good.
This restaurant is located in a nice area away from the street with Palm Trees & large fountain.
"We hadn't booked a table a 'La Boveda', thinking that because it was more more of a tapas bar, it wouldn't be necessary."
"However, we were wrong and had to put our names on the list once we arrived and waited about half an hour."
"Living in Spain and being familiar with the usual tapas, I have to say I liked the list of options."
"We ordered a tortilla (Spanish omelette), cod 'croquetas' (fried cod bites), squid and dates wrapped in bacon."
"Now, I have to say, most of the tapas were average, but the dates wrapped in bacon were absolutely divine!"
They were delicious melted in your mouth.
The waiter was very attentive and friendly and overall I came away with a good feeling from this place (and a good taste!
).
I thought this restaurant was great!
The food was yummy and everything looked and smelled wonderful!
It was very popular which i think is due to what an amazing place this is.
"The only downside was that the waiter was really unfriendly, and although I understand how he busy he was, it was pretty terrible."
"The waiters, however, seemed friendly and helpful...I would definitely go back many times to try all of their great tapas dishes!"
Good tapas for a reasonable price.
"Crowded and noisy, but the staff are friendly."
This is the place the locals crowd into.
You have to get there at opening time.
There is no formality.
It is a 'grab your table quick' place.
"The waiters, some of whom have been there for over ten years, are brisk and efficient."
Recognise it by the huge wine barrels!
"Each time we holiday in Palma, we eat here at least twice."
The glasses of beer are cheap and refreshing.
See the menu on the wall by the door.
Have a starter of the traditional melon and ham.
Then try the dates in bacon and the whitebait.
"The last time i was there, I fancied a steak so I had surloin with roquefort cheese."
"It was spectacular, with chips of course."
"Across Europe, all the food writers know this place."
"The problem is, it's too popular!"
Advice: get there at opening time.
Their times (lunch and dinner) when they are open are not long (about two hours only for lunch...) The reserved tables seem to be at the far end under the arch where there is good air-conditioning.
"It is simply packed with locals, which says it all."
"I lived in Tokyo for several years, and was genuinely excited to try Shunka based on the recommendations offered via Trip Advisor, to relive some fond culinary memories but was unfortunately, disappointed."
"The restaurant resembles an ""izakaya,"" a popular, casual and relatively cheap place found all over Japan for after-work drinking and inexpensive food."
"These sorts of places are very common throughout Japan, and they have charm."
"Shunka captures the same feeling for a fleeting moment when you walk in, especially the bar seating area, but the balance of the restaurant crowded with miniature tables adds little else."
The ambiance is lacking.
"There were no Japanese patrons sitting in the restaurant, it was mostly English speaking tourists."
"The proprietor is Japanese and sits at the cash register, raking in the money, but the majority of staff is Chinese, including the sushi chefs."
"The staff works hard, but the service is not efficient and is prone to error."
It is not as authentic of an experience as many people perceive it to be.
"My friends from Russia enjoyed their tuna sushi, but my ""ebi sushi"" was butterfly cut, and grilled, a first for me ."
"The best thing I had was probably the Udon, but it is something I can make at home, and I prefer my version of this traditional noodle dish more."
"Shunka is overpriced, the service lacking, it is not genuine, and certainly not worthy of such a high ranking in Trip Advisor, given so many other great venues to eat, even in the same neighborhood."
"Barcelona is truly one of the greatest ""food"" cities in the world."
Stay away from this venue as you most likely would a Spanish restaurant when in Osaka.
"In short, if you have been exposed to quality Japanese cuisine, you will be disappointed; if not, you will probably enjoy the experience and have a favorable opinion of the place."
"La Cabana is a super restaurant away from the crowds, on the LZ 2 at Macher."
Small intimate and superb food.
Although definitely not the cheapest restaurant in Lanzarote if you want an excellent meal in a small but perfectly formed little restaurant you won't do better than La Cabana.
Good choice of dishes all freshly cooked by owner chef and served by his wife.
"Most regular customers are local villa owners who appreciate the quality food, wine and service on offer."
"Location was the best part, though our table was toward the back of the patio so it felt like we were inside."
Bread cost 1.90 euros for a small piece and the sangria was overpriced and nothing special.
The paella was okay.
"We had turbot and monkfish, and both dishes were original and tasted very nice."
"Although the restaurant was crowded (and the neighbouring restaurants were not), service was fast and correct."
"You might say they wanted us to go, so that they could seat new costumers, but when we asked the waiter to slow down a bit, he proposed to wait 10 minutes before bringing our coffee, and did exactly so."
Local Catalan cuisine.
You will either love or hate the service here.
"The owner won't give you a menu, and seats you at communal tables - a few people were not comfortable with this and walked away."
"He tells you what they have tonight, and will choose your wine for you."
"If you are afraid you are going to be ripped off, don't be - the prices are reasonable, and the limited choice means you are only offerred what is fresh and good that day."
"We had one of the best Riojas I have tasted for only €12 a bottle, and the food was excellent."
"The communal tables make it a very sociable place, even struggling with the language barriers."
"Only opens at 8.30pm, and very popular later in the evening."
"we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant for lunch, in front of the bathrooms and right by the staircase (HEAVY traffic area)."
"Our waiter was constantly mumbling in spanish to us, refused to assist us with the menu which was completely in spanish, and didn't help us get the one waiter's help who did speak english."
"our lunch for two which was one appetizer, one entree, and an omlette cost us 78 Euro, let me emphasize that this was ""without wine OR dessert."""
"Save your money, avoid this place."
We only went there as it was reviewed modestly from both frommers and tripadvisor.
I studied abroad in Sevilla in the Spring of 2005.
"After class at the university, I would often stop at Las Columnas for a snack on my walk back to my host family's house."
The pringas were my favorite.
The best way i can describe them is that they are like toasted mini-pulled pork sandwiches.
I've been to a handful of tapas restaurants in the States and haven't been able to find them on the menu.
The bar itself is really cool.
"It's located in the Barrio de Santa Cruz, which is the old Jewish quarter and is right around the corner from the Cathedral and Alcazar."
It's lively and crowded inside with very few places to sit.
"If you're looking for a sit-down meal, don't come here."
"From what I remember though, the place has an authentic feel."
The bartenders keep track of open tabs by writing in chalk on the bar top.
"If you are visiting Sevilla and are looking for a unique place to grab a beer and a snack, I would definitely recommend that you check out Las Columnas"
Norberto and his team is the best in Madrid.
"Perfect food, perfect vine and excellent service."
Highly recommended!
"We chose to go into the china garden, as we had heard of a really lovely chinese in benidorm but forgot what it was named, and as we walked up the street every resturant and bar we passed (early on a tuesday night) were emply and china garden was full to the rafters, had to be the place and gotta be a good sign we thought!"
"Staff were soo lovely, food gorgeous, service faultless."
The lady that greats you on your way in is lovely and they see you out when your going also.
Price was great and they have a large menu that would suit every one.
It was well air conditioned and they give you a little non-alcoholic drink on your way out(I think its non-alcoholic)!
As we sat their we noticed that the staff seemed to know the majority of the customers coming in and out and any they didnt know they were so friendly to.
"My daughter slept in her buggie throughtout the entire time, so the lady gave have her a bag of prawn crackers to take with us."
"Wish China Garden would suddenly decide to move to Belfast, I'd be eating in it every night lol"
we were on a self catering holiday so finding this little gem was brilliant we ate there most nights as it was easier than trying to shop (well we were on our hols) the service was brilliant too the commenter about the star rating must not like a bargain if ure finclusive u wont feel the pinch if u visit this fine eaterie anyone going to benidorm should try it really friendly staff who put up with us brits home from home
"Lovely little restaurant... Staff are polite helpful and provide excellent table service Get three courses for just 4.95 Euros which also includes a glass of beer, wine or soft drink!"
Upgrade to on of the other menus dependant upon your preference for 5.50 Euros or 7.50 Euros which is the absolute dearest!
"Again all include wine, beer or a soft drink!"
Best chinese in Benidorm by far and just fantastically priced.
food amazing and all home made even chips!!!!!
price very good service very good and helpful well recomend to all
"We had a wonderful meal at this restaurant in Cordoba, although its popularity on tourist websites, guides etc could be its downfall if too many tourists ""invade"" the place."
Hordes of Americans and Japanese asking waiters to take photos does not help an otherwise wonderful ambiente.
"The food and the staff were excellent - the solomillo amongst the best we have had around Spain, and cheaper than in most UK restaurants, where filet mignon is rapidly disappearing from menus."
This place really represented for me what a tapas bar should be in spain.
Since we had no idea what to order (w/ limited spanish & food vernacular) the person at the bar went ahead and put a plate together for us comprised of what was available at the bar (there is a small snapshot of the bar posted) - just a little bit of this and that.
Which was perfect for us since we like to try a little bit of everything.
Food was excellent!
Prices were reasonable.
A+ for a tapas bar.
Reasonably priced tapas bar with good food and service and a nice setting.
We had the worst meal of our trip in this restaurant/bar.
The classic spinish and chickpea dish was cooked to death (It may have been started around 1670 with more salt added every day) and so loaded with salt that I can only conclude it was designed to spur the sale of beverages.
"It is an interesting place and the bar was full of locals who, perhaps I should have noticed when we entered, were drinking and not eating."
If you want to go do so for a drink do so but avoid joining the other tourists in paying far to much for a bad meal.
Gracia is a charming neighborhood and now have another point to his favor.
Con Gracia restaurant is that point.
"Cool decor and style, the staff was definitely one of the best (if not the BEST) that i found in all my travels, great knowledge of his profession and sense of humor."
And what about food?
Holy God!
"surprise menu was amazing, an awesome combination of tastes and flavours, before all they ask you what you like, what you don't, in order to avoid disagreeable surprises."
Wine selection was superb too.
Price?
well if you want cheaply prices you can go to a kebab two streets down below.
"I'll will come back to Con Gracia even i'll go to Barcelona, and you must do the same!"
!
I agree with the many positive reviews of this restaurant though would not rate it as #1.
I went there with my fiance for a romantic dinner.
We just loved the restaurant.
"It's not one of these big restaurants where you have lots of tables, waiters and noise."
It's absolutely marvelous.
"The service is top, always helpful and attentive."
"But not too much, you still have your privacy."
The waiter explaining you all the plates.
"And the food is just amazing, we have chosen the surprise menu with the corresponding wines."
The perfect choice.
"The timing between the plates was good, and the taste was just astonishing."
"Obviously, it's more expensive than other restaurants and tapas bar, but you should be aware of that, when you choose this kind of restaurant."
We defintely will go there again.
We'll never forget the experience we had there for dinner.
My husband and i decided to try this restaurant based on reviews and were not disappointed!!
"The food was superb, service impeccable what more can one ask for."
The dinner really ended our holiday on a very high note.
I have been there couple of times now and it is really a good place.
After living in Barcelona for almost a year now and with great interest in food I have tried a lot of places.
From Quimet & Quimet to Abac.
"Con Gracia stands out as a rather informal (well, everything is relative, I know) place with food where the main focus is on the taste."
"Don't worry, presentation is good as well, but tastewise it is really impressive."
"Nice and friendly people working there, excellent wines, and good atmosphere."
It is maybe the best place for me to go for a dinner because you can get food that taste great for a price which is more than acceptable.
I had dinner here with my fiancé and can only describe this as perfect.
We have eaten i several Michelin starred restaurants in the U.K. and my fiancé's opinion is that overall it was better than Gordon Ramsay's main restaurant in London.
The table service was excellent being restrained but attentive.
In other gourmet restaurants there is a tendency to have armies of waiters hovering in attendance which can spoil intimate dinners.
Here we had the host assisted by a single waitress handling the dozen or so tables.
Being English we like to eat earlier than the local Spanish so we were first in the restaurant.
Its small size allowed all the tables to be well served as the restaurant became busier.
We started with cocktails and selected the 5 course chef's surprise menu with accompanying wines.
Each course was started with the particular wine chosen to compliment the meal and then the surprise was revealed.
"We began our meal with a gaspatcho soup, followed by a course of liver pate with a ginger paste and balsamic vinegar."
"Next came the tenderest seared tune I have ever eaten, then a passable duck (probably the weakest course only because we had eaten a divine fried duck course the previous night at Shunka."
Cheeses were followed by a mint creme amusee and dessert was a perfect creme brulee (I'm not a creme brulee fan but I'd gladly eat that one again).
"Lastly we had biscuit, with a strawberry gelatine cube (tasting much like a jammy dodger when combined) with an accompanying chocolate cube."
Our host called up a cab and we were whisked away from a wonderful venue.
For any who have been disappointed at Con Gracia I can only assume that the random choice of chef's specialities didn't suit their tastes on those particular instances.
"On a visit to Barcelona with five friends, we were looking for a special dining experience, and after reading the reviews of Barcelona restaurants on TA, 'Con Gracia' apperaed to be the one to go for."
What a fantastic experience.
"We went for the 'Surprise menu' with wines selected by Frederic, who talked us through each course and wine."
The service and food could not be faulted.
We will be back.
"PS - the restaurant is very small, so make sure you book ahead."
"The service was great, and so were the food."
"All in all, an excellent experience, highly recommendable."
"We had the surprise meny, and expessially the tomato soup was a real surprise!"
"When it arrived it looked so blend, but it tasted absolutely amazing."
"My wife and I found this restuarant serving local food on the second day of a two week holiday in Port de Pollensa and we loved it, it's probably the best holiday restuarant we've been to."
It's tucked in a side street off the main square so it doesn't get much passing tourist trade but there are lots of locals eating there and they obviously know a good thing.
We only ate lunch here as we have an 18 month old and the 3 course set lunch (3 choices for each course plus drink) at 9 euros has to be the best value food in Port de Pollensa.
"I particularly loved the baked fish, the baked eggs with tumbet and my wife loved the prawns and pork escalope."
"We all enjoyed the desserts, especially my daughter, and would recommend the pineapple mousse, if it's on, and the creme caramel (but maybe not the ice cream which looked shop-bought)."
"It can be a busy place at lunchtimes and it's not somewhere where the staff are going to fuss over you but we enjoyed the atmosphere, the service is quick and they all speak good English (one is English!)."
"Definitely try the restuarant if you want to sample great, local food and if you are holidaying on a budget it's a must."
It's inspired me to find out more about Mallorcan food since we got back.
"The garlic prawns are beautiful, and the service was great too."
"they really know how to cook Fish without overcooking it, and the deserts are also fantastic."
Ate on the terrace here one afternoon.
"They had a very reasonably priced three course ""menu del dia""."
It was here that I discovered Salmorejo.
I tried it many more times while in Spain but the best was at Paprika.
Friendly service and great food.
A nice place to eat before exploring the Albaicin.
This is one of the worst Spanish restaurants that I've been to in Spain.
"Last May I visited Madrid with my husband and we went for dinner to the restaurant: ""La Chata""."
We had parrillada.
"It was complete disgusting, very bad prepared and it tasted very bad."
We tried a bit but we couldn’t continue eating and I got sick after that.
Don't go to this restaurant even if you are starving.
...
I went to the Casa Patas with my granddaughter at the end of May 2009.
"The service in the restaurant is not bad, although it seemed a bit expensive."
"Just before the show began, we were herded into the show-room."
It was very crowded and difficult to see from the back (the tables are not 'stepped' so that people at the front block the view of people at the back.
"I know Spain fairly well, and have seen some excellent Flamenco in Andalusia."
This show was not up to those standards.
It almost seemed amateurish.
I came away feeling cheated.
I know Casa Patas has a good reputation but quite honestly I thought that it was a tourist 'rip off'.
When in Madrid next time I will certainly not go there and will not recommend it to any of my friends
"PLA is a five-minute walk from the Jaume I metro, hidden in an alley."
The place is very cool.
"The menu is clever and unique, and the food exceptionally fine."
"The appetizers were excellent, as were the main courses."
We shared the home-made ice cream for dessert - outstanding.
"The only disappointment was the wine by glass; they had a choice of two reds, one worse than the other."
Stick with bottles.
"I realize now that I've been entering the cost-per-person in my other reviews in euros, not dollars."
We spent without the wine and tip about 70 euros for two.
This is a special place.
Try it.
The tapas were excellent (although the three listed (we tried each) seemed to all feature cod.
"It was confusing at first for us, but after getting some help from a local, we figured out how to get food there."
The line that forms is to get food immediately.
The people at the counter are likely not to say anything to you once you get up there - they will stare and wait for you to place your order.
You pay and then bring your food to a table if you can find one.
A waiter will take your drink orders but doesn't deal with the food.
We would have gone earlier (than 9:00 p.m.) to avoid the lines if we'd known how crazy it would be.
Amazing!
!
If you want to get dressed up and have a romantic dinner you should certainly consider Pla.
On our honeymoon and we found this place via trip advisor.
Make sure you do no go to Re-Pla....we got completely lost and this place is not on a main street but in a little alley.
Very tough to find.
Once you get there and have a glass ( or 2 ) of wine you will find out why this restaurant ranks so high.
"Great food, environment and service."
Make your stay pleasant and hit this place up!
I've taken a long time to get this review on site .
This restaurant is not only excellent it is reasonably priced considering both the quality of food and service but also the ambiance of the restaurant.
Having visited almost all the best rated places in southern Tenerife over the last 16 years this place is by far the best .
It was recommended to us by a friend who had previously recommended a highly recommended place where we had a terrrible and very expensive New Years Eve meal in 2007.
We had mad a an unexpected summer visit last year and our usual christmas/ new year one the following December .
On both holidays we ate here three times and made the error of not booking early enough for the New Years Eve meal.
First: The Restaurant - elegant but not intimidatingly so - beautifully appointed and decorated with two outside table for those who want to dine al fresco.
There is also an area partitioned off for small parties.
"The Service - charming , efficient , knowledgeable , unintrusive."
The food : sublime.
Pascal does French and Spanish classics but also his own takes on standards.
The taster menu was eight or nine courses of utter quality and inventiveness .
There is an extensive daily board utilising whatever was available at market that day as well as an la carte menu.The wine list is thoughtful and very reasonably priced.
"For people who love good food and good service at reasonable prices Pascal , along with Las Roques and Bistrot D'Alain ( the latter in Los Cristianos and the former at Los Abrigos would be my three choices for good dining in Southern Tenerife."
"The place is so cheesy, and the decor is like a cheesy remake of a roman museum."
"The only thing that made us go in is need for caffeine, and the clientele, which was mostly local older people which gave the place a little credibility."
My husband and myself visited this fantastic restaurant and were treated impecably by the staff there.
The food was an absolute joy and we were more than happy with everything.
"We had an aperitif of champagne, then were offered homemade bread and olives."
We were then brought sardines with raspberry sauce which was wonderrful.
"I ate the prawn carpaccio which was the best, then I ate the lamb which was moist and totally appetising."
My husband had the seafood starter and the grouper for mains.
"We the shared the profitteroles with cream, ice cream and chocolate sauce which was fab."
We had wine and water and the bill came to 134 Euros which I would have paid for the views alone.
I liked this mom and pop place.
"It was homely, and we were treated well by all of the staff."
"Entrees were ok, but we've had better italian."
Still worth going because it's a nice atmosphere!
Good food and reasobnably priced.
They had a menu in English and many of the waiters could speak English which is a bonus in Madrid.
Definitely recommend.
We returned to Francisco ll last night for dinner with another couple.
Something great is going on in the kitchen.
The gambas pil pil were the best any of us have erver had.
The entire meal was superb and the outdoor setting just added to the entire experience.
"Great food, excellent service and reasonable prices; what more can you ask for."
This is the best restaurant in town.
"Food here was really good, arrived very quickly and was excellent value, cheaper than many restaurants around."
The only problem was the 25 minute wait after our main course plates had been taken away.
"We sat being practically ignored and had to ask for the bill and were never asked if our meal was OK, if we wanted dessert etc."
"Recommended only as food nice and prices were good, just don't expect a speedy service."
We visited the Torre Bahia the other night and had a very mixed experience.
"Service was a little ""off-ish"", not rude, but not friendly."
Some dishes were good and some middling and some down-right bad.
"I started with ""grilled garlic mushrooms"" which was a very over-priced tin of sliced mushrooms with dried garlic powder."
Disgusting.
The addition of two half cloves of semi-raw garlic couldn't fool anyone.
Really disappointing.
"For main, I had ""Iberian pork with raisins and pinenuts"" - again very quickly thrown together and tough."
"Saying that, my fellow diners enjoyed their meals, especially the lamb shoulder."
"All in all, my verdict is that it was all done on the cheap and with very little care or imagination."
Cheap prices but for cheap food.
"We had lunch here, because of the many reviews and recommendations in travel guides etc."
We ordered the the Paella marisca (seafood) and some bread.
The bread with garlic was very good so the expectations for the Paella were high.
The Paella was very disapointing.
It was very very salt.
"My wive is a Paella marisco lover, but she did not eat much of this salty mash."
A few days later we had lunch at La Perla and the Paella here was much better than at Pepico.
The ambience is beautiful and service excellent but shocked at the standard of cooking.
Lobster and monkfish was inedible as this had been over-cooked and was rubberised.
Presentation also left a lot to be desired.
"This certainly was not a ""fine dining"" experience, which given the cost, should have been."
"We had read on the internet that "" Le Meridiana"" was a one star michelin restaurant and attached to a upmarket night club...nothing could be further from the truth !"
Stay away!
Worst service.
"worst food,worst management of any so called upscale restaurant we have EVER experienced ANYWHERE in the world."
Nothing more to say !
This traditional restaurant was recommended everywhere...but our visit was disappointing.
Local is like a noisy waiting hall and the paella not really tasty.
Felt like in a food factory or canteen
I have long since found Spanish resturants to be lacking in the salad department.
"Mostly , they serve up lettuce, gratted carrot, tomatoe and some olives, and with Tuna , if you purchase the ""house special"" ."
Hardly a gastronomic experience.
Hardly special.
This little cafe/bistro does the opposite.
"It offer a wide choice of about 12 salads, as main courses, all imaginative combinations incorporating lots of different ingredients such (often fresh fruits are added) which arrive on the table like a work of art."
"Very reasonable about 8 euros on average, you will really feel like you have really had a treat."
The service can be a little slow during busy times.
We either arrive before 1pm or after 3pm and the wait is OK.
"Having been to Nerja a couple of times a year since 2003, we have visited this restaurant on many occasions."
"We always enjoyed it up until about 2 years ago, when it all seemed to change."
"The food is overpriced, and it doesn't seem to matter what you order, each dish tastes the same."
"The first few times we went the food was exquisite, but we will not bother going back again."
"The food is bland, stodgy and tastes of nothing."
"We're not quite sure what the chicken has had done to it, but it's as if it's the last few bits scraped off the bones, all stringy and scraggly."
Highly disappointing.
"Unfortunately, with it being a 'mexican' restaurant, many tourists will wander in unaware, enticed by the bright inviting colours."
"This is why I am writing this, please don't bother, it will be a waste of your time."
Maybe this place was good at some stage but not now.
Maybe the chef has changed.
"Food is bland; yes bland, and over priced."
I never write restaurant reviews but I was that wired with this place.
The building is impressive but that's about it.
Couldn't recommend it.
Ronda seems like a quiet town but there are plenty of restaurants dotted around.
I visited this restaurant on 5th June 2009 with my partner.
We had hoped for a meal of some quality assuming of course that price and quality correlate.
"What we experienced can only be described as a paltry, vastly overpriced offering that could bearly be described as a meal."
"It was bland, utterly tasteless and an insult to anyone who is able to cook on anything but the most basic level."
To add further insult we were sold a country wine from a large general wine producing region of Spain which the restaurant purported to be from a more specialised well known denomination; the significance of which is that they were selling a cheaper wine at an inflated price.
When this was raised with the maitre d' she was patronising initially and then claimed she could not understand English.
This restaurant is an utter disgrace in my view; it is run by charlatans who know nothing about food or wine.
After being in contact with Fabio over the months regarding our booking was given a lovely warm welcome when the 10 of us (all girls) arrived for our dinner reservation.
All were given a free cocktail shot (which was delicious by the way) before being led to a lovely table at the back.
Our waitress was lovely and even coped well with us confusing her with our rather large drinks order.
"Food was excellent, can definitely recommend the steak in mushroom sauce and wine delicious."
Also the final bill at the end was very reasonable and I will definitely recommend La Luna to family and friends when they visit Barcelona.
Hope to pop in for a drink when I return to Barcelona on a stop off on my cruise in August.
Lovely atmosphere with great food and coctails in 1/2 liter bottles (the mai tai's were great).
"We would particularly recommend the quesedillas, nachos, bruchetta biff and the rocket salat."
Lovely place to hang out and have some snack.
"PS we didn't have time to try the resturant, we only had tapas in the bar."
Fantastic place to catch up with friends - not cheap but then you are paying for location... Food was lovely (Spicy roast chicken was really great) as was the wine (which was surprisingly cheap for a restaurant of this caliber).
Great for people watching - especially for playing spot the surgery!!
a must if you are around Puerto Portals....
We stayed in salou for 14 days and we tried many places around the centre of salou but kept returning back to uncle sam's.
The quality of food in other restaurants is nowhere near the standard of this american diner.
"I would definately recommend it to everyone and anyone who is going to salou, i would guarantee nobody will be dissapointed."
The staff are extremely friendly and the portion size is beyond belief.
Overall a great place to eat and i would defnately return.
We stayed in salou from June 8th - 15th.
We found exceptional food at an exceptional price when we dined at uncle sams (6 out of the 7 days) for both Breakfast and Dinner!
It was very clean.
We found the service to be second to none.
"The staff were polite, friendly and very efficent."
We never had to wait too long for a table and were always made to feel welcome!
We found it to be very child friendly.
They even accomodated us by cutting the rack of ribs (gorgeous by the way) in half for our son - he loved them!
"Before we left Salou, we brought other family members out for a meal there and one of their children is a very picky eater - we were thrilled - she loved her chicken dippers and no-one had to try to persuade her to eat (as is usually done lol)!"
"Once you've found the main beach in Salou, you'll find UNCLE SAMS just off of the street 'Avda."
de Carles Buigas' on this street 'C.
d'Amposta' - you will see Burger King on the end of this street - UNCLE SAMS is just up this street on the right hand side.
We can't recommend them enough - Enjoy!!
!
Highly recommended.
"Great staff, big portions, delicious food."
"we have just come back from two weeks in salou and this was the best place to eat that we found.it is reasonably priced and large portions are a given.we ate here at least 9 of 14 nights.it has a great variety of food from burgers ,steaks and ribs to tex mex..the kids menu is also varied and there is something to please anyone.the staff are v friendly and it has a great atmosphere.we tried loads of different things on the menu and had no complaints,it is also so clean which is really important..we will definately be going back here next holiday!"
We always visit Celler La Parra when in Puerto Pollensa.
"The food is typical Majorcan, and served in style."
"We are treated like king and queen when we eat there, as is everyone."
The food is so so good...best to book if you want to dine there.
"It is not a place to go if you want fast food, be prepared to wait, but the food is well worth the wait.....easy to have a few drinks whilst you are waiting."
"We have only ever seen one waiter (always the same one) when we have eaten ther, but he is so lovely, and explains all the dishes if you need it."
Cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough....only thing that worries me is ...once everyone finds it....will we ever get a booking again.....or will they be too busy.
Rosemary & Chris Finch ........West Midlands
Myself & my partner ate there last week.
5th Ave is hidden up a side St. off the main St. Cant fault the previous reviews.
"Great food, wonderful staff."
I had the Surf & Turf which was incredible.
"Unfortunately we were the only people in the restaurant at the time,  which meant that there was little atmosphere, but the whole resort was fairly quiet to be fair."
5th Ave gets the thumbs up from me!
Four of us stopped here for lunch after leaving the Alcazar because it was the only restaurant we saw on the plaza and we were all quite hungry.
"There were customers at the outdoor tables, but the empty spots were in the sun, so we went upstairs."
Lovely decor.
When we saw the prices on the menu my appetite dropped quite quickly.
I ordered the seafood bisque with scampis at 16 euros.
There was ONE scampi floating in a tomato-based broth that tasted like kidneys and smelled of old fish.
"Husband ordered an appetizer of a meat sampler of Spain which turned out to be a cold plate of salamis and sausages that he could have bought at the Mercadona for around 3 euros, but El Giraldillo charged around 20."
Sis-in-law had chicken with garlic for around 18 euros that was edible and bro-in-law ate a veal stew that had pretty tough meat for around 18 euros as well.
Beverages were 2 glasses of Sangria and 2 beers.
Total bill was 106 euros.
"With each plate that was brought to the table, we could only look at each other and laugh at our own stupidity for neglecting to look at a menu before we entered the restaurant."
"But, prices not withstanding, the food was abominably poor."
Service was inattentive and we had to check with our cc company to be sure we weren't ripped off in charges because it took 15 minutes from the time we gave them the card til they came back with the slip- and we were the only customers in the entire upstairs.
"Also, the automatic light in the aseo kept going out when I was using the facility!"
"The biggest and best potion of gambas pil pil, loaded with garlic...heaven."
Love sitting outisde here and if we're in Nerja for a couple of weeks we'll eat here at least twice.
Wine is cheap too!
I always love a place that put food on the table before you even start to order!
this place is great.
The food was amazing and its a must visit if you come down to the south of Spain.
Had a greta night with faamily and friend whilst we watched the fire works for the festival Service was 1st class food ok but it was packed have had better food there many times before
A wonderful courtyard setting and a good wine list make this a very good choice for dinner in Seville.
The food while not outstanding was good and reasonably priced - dinner for two with a bottle of good wine was about 60/65 euros.
My husband and i have been holidaying in caleta for the last ten years and Fado Rock Steak House is brilliant in every way.
There are a few Fado restaurants in caleta ie; potugese and Indian.
"I think that some of the negative write ups are for the others as i can't imagine anyone complaining about the steak house, it's so popular that if you're not there for half eight you can find yourself queuing down the street!"
"The staff never stop moving, servingand cleaning tables, they are polite and helpful and earn every penny they are paid."
We walked in at 1:30 for lunch without a reservation.
"The business lunch made the full meal affordable: 20 euros each which included bread, cover, appetizer, main course, desert, water, coffee and a glass of wine."
"Yes - the waiter only poured half a glass, and we wondered about that, since we saw him refilling the wine glasses of the locals."
Hmmm.
Those tourists..
"The place is beautiful, upscale, and the atmosphere was lovely."
Our waiter was very polite.
The food was delicious - all of it.
The chocolates they served at the end of the meal were outstanding.
"For sure is the best restaurant in Madrid, I have tried hundreds all around Spain."
"Starting for the service is absolutely perfect, it means dont bother you but they always are when you need it without asking for."
"The chef introduce you the menu and he gives you the explanation of each food, apart from the menu they always have daily products that probably you dont find anymore, so I recommend at least try one of the daily suggestions."
"Dont need formal clothes, is casual, the atmosphere is friendly and you can ask in every moment whatever you want."
The food is the best I have tried.
"Premium quality products, mainly Spanish but also plenty from abroad."
Not sophisticated nor foams or chemical experiments.
Very elaborated cuisine but you know what are you eating ever and the portions are huge not minimal at all.
"Cellar with thousands of references, wines worldwide."
"Sincerely the best in Madrid, I use to go every month because I live 400 km far."
"And belive me, money value guaranteed."
"The chocolate was delicious, and they are the only place we visited that sold cocoa mix, but we had much better churros elsewhere."
Perfect location right on the beach.
And lovely food.
"A bit expensive, but its defenitly worth it because of the view and the good quality of the food."
Lovely setting and good food.
have been several times and a nice menu.
Excellent food - well cooked.
hello .. last weekend we went with some friends to walk through the Latin .. we decided to eat at any side until we go through the door of this restaurant.... its atmosphere attracted us all .
the food was delicious ... what i like best was frog legs with ginger soy and lemon and salmon with sweet mustard ..... the service was very nice and efficient .. .. great atmosphere .. distended ....young people..we had a very nice time there !!!!!
ill be back!!!
!jajajaj...
Just back from Santa Ponsa and we would say Bobby's does the best breakfast in town.
"Scottish, English or what ever combination you like."
We are a bit biased as Bobby is a neighbour and he might throw something at or window.
All joking aside it's a great place to eat and the staff are soooooooo friendly.
Martin & Irene
This was the worst place that we've eaten at in a very long time.
Overtones of the lamentable British motorway service station cafe.
"Surly, unhelpful staff with serious attitude problems."
"The large menu had a number of items not available, including fruit at the height of the local season."
No non-smoking area.
"Prime site signposted from the motorway, consequently higher prices than other restaurants closer to town"
"i had always wanted to go here as it looks very nice from outside as you pass-by and it always looks busy which generally is a good sign.the restaurant is like a bar with very expensive tapas, all high chairs except for one table.i realize that top quality product has a price ,but this has to be backed up by presentation and creative plates which was lacking .the cheaper plates gave more satisfaction but still were expensive to other restaurants,all in all it is TOO EXPENSIVE for what it is."
My fiancee went to Bar Mut our first night in Barcelona because it was one of the few places in the neighborhood open at 11:30PM on a Thursday night.
We were by a table near the piano - the ambience is very eclectic and warm.
"They did not have menus but we were told what they have by the waiter and we selected four things: prawns, filet with foie gras, grilled mushrooms and an assortment of sliced meats (iberico ham, etc.)."
The prawns were OK - not my style - I'm not into finger food and these had to be deshelled and beheaded at the table.
The filet/foie gras was amazing... best dish.
The mushrooms were a bit bland (needed to get some salt) and the sliced meats were very good.
I had about 4 glasses (small glasses) or red wine and my fiancee had a couple glasses of cava.
"When the bill came, I was a bit shocked - not because if was over 140 EUR - what surprised me was that the filet/foie dish, the mushrooms and the sliced meats were all in the 14-18 EUR range, however the 5 prawns we ordered were 57 EUR!!"
More than 11 EUR apiece!
"When we confronted the waiter about this, he said that this was the market rate for these prawns and that is what they cost."
We told him we didn't think it was right that he offered this as an option without telling us that the price was MUCH MORE than the other items to allow us to make a decision then.
"The waiter listened, apologized and bought us another round of drinks but we felt taken advantage of."
"I would recommend this place to others, just make sure to get an idea of the prices before ordering....."
There are 3 San Marco's restaurants and all 3 have different character.
This one is in a really cool location and the people are super friendly.
"It is a little on the pricier side and the portions are not huge, but the food is DELICIOUS."
"If you like good Italian food, I definitely suggest going here!"
Make a reservation on weekends if you feel up to calling the restaurant!
"The restaurant is very unique inside if you like atmosphere, this is the place to go!"
"Dress is between casual and dressy, I mean, all of Spain is very fashionable!"
My hubbie and I had the pleasure of visitng Barcelona for a quick break.
Loved the city and all it had to offer.
Was a little dissappointed in the the food area that is until we found the 'Jewel in the Crown.'
"Marmalade Bar & Restaurant, a few mins walk from the ramblas, is owned by an Irish couple who obviously have a great eye for design & decor and amazing food."
"The place is divided into four different areas with beautiful sofas, copper clad walls, an amazing art deco black bar & for those who likes billards, a beautiful billard table to one side of the bar giving it a very gentlemans club feel."
"The music is funky, the staff easygoing and friendly (they all speak english - very helpfull) we tried the Duck Carpaccio and Fresh Spinach Tagliatelli in a creamy mushroom sauce - to die for, they have an extensive menu so here is something there to suit all tastes and it is so inexpensive."
Cocktails that leave you wanting more.
"Marmalade really is a very special place, so much that we went back every evening of our stay."
They also have another bar called 'Milk' again an amazing place with fantastic food and wonderful staff.
We can wholeheartly recommend Marmalade - defeniately a must when visiting this great city.
We chose Marmalade based on the positive reviews on this site and it's relationship to Milk Bar and Bistro.
"It was our last night in Barcelona, and we wanted a great dining experience."
We were not disappointed!
The atmosphere is stylish and comfortable.
We arrived around 8:00pm (early for Barcelona standards) and were able to enjoy the last hour of Happy Hour (7-9pm) where cocktails are offered at 4 Euros.
They have an extensive cocktail list and reasonably priced wines by the glass and bottle.
Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu.
"They have a menu offering a variety of small dishes, and it's encouraged to get several of them (suggested 3-4 per person) over the whole meal."
"We shared all of the dishes we ordered, and each was fresh and flavorful!"
"There was a complimentary starter of asparagus soup served in a shot glass, and it was wonderful."
I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu!
We highly recommend this restaurant.
Old Madrid flair with a young crowd.
We go to Garum for lunch on every trip to Spain - about 5 times a year.
Set lunch is 10 euros 50 for 3 courses and it never disappoints.
The chef is Dutch and certainly knows how to use fresh herbs in his food.
The homemade rosemary bread is to die for.
This restaurant was recommended to us and didn't disappoint!
"Located just a few blocks from the Prado museum and the Japanese botanical gardens, this restaurant is another treasure on the Paseo del Prado."
"The food is authentic, and the dishes were on par with the best Thai restaurants that I have eaten at anywhere in the world."
"Despite being located in the heart of Madrid's tourist area, the food is very reasonably priced."
"Most dishes are priced between 6 - 9 Euros, and the restaurant was willing to adjust dishes for a member of our party who is a vegetarian."
"In addition to being a great restaurant, Pad Thai is perfect for American or British travelers since the menu has English translation for all of the dishes."
"The atmosphere was fantastic in the back room, and it was one of the only places in Madrid where we could eat without being in a cloud of cigarette smoke."
"We were recommended this place, but to be honest it wasn't a favorite of ours."
"There was certainly a wide variety of Tapas on offer and the staff were pleasant, however we had dishes arrive that we had not ordered, including one that had a long fish bone going through it which my toddler nearly chocked on."
"They say that the sign of a good restaurant is when the local's eat there, which is certainly the case with Tipi, but for us as non smokers, the amount of cigarette and no acess to open windows, meant we didn't eat there again."
"Top bar is an incredible bar, i spent most of my holiday sitting on there terrace and enjoying the guinness in this bar."
"FOOD: Good food, not the cheapest around but what they prepare is good, healthy and a lot."
"SERVICE: Very good, the first day i came i dropped my guinness , the bartender replaced it no charge!"
"they have a large terrace with table service, i had 3 different waiters and they were all professional, one even cleaned my glasses!"
"VALUE: A pint guinness is 4,75 , not the cheapest but they all tasted just like home and even better!"
"ATMOSPHERE: Very good, feels like home!"
"kind regards Rudolfh lingren Essen, Germany and Ireland"
We learnt about this restaurant from reading the reviews on TA.
"We took a chance and showed up without any reservations, but they were able to provide us a table (for 2)."
"It was about half full (8:30pm) but by the time we left at 10pm, ppl were waiting to get a table since it was packed."
The seafood was amazing but the paella and sole was a little TOO salty...and my husband enjoys salty food!
We think the chef/cook was too generous with the salt.
We still enjoyed the paella.
The cheese (brie) salad and seafood soup were both really good.
"Overall would recommend thsi restaurant for the food , service and atmosphere."
"Just went to lunch here today ($60 USD including drinks + tip), which might have been worth it if the paella wasn´t so salty and the waitress was not so rude."
I´ve downed 2.5 liters of water since the salty paella and now I´m feeling a bit ill.
There were three waiters who serviced my table.
"When I asked for the check, waitress #2 stopped to show it to waitress #1, who looked at it, rolled her eyes, made some sort of complaint in Catalan and walked away."
Was $50 not high enough for lunch?
"I´ll never know, because when I went to speak to the manager the waitress came over and claimed (according to him) that it was a misunderstanding because she doesn´t speak English."
(???)
"Apparently, eye rolling means something else in Catalan."
The manager suggested that it might have been my imagination.
"I´m a veteran of this business, well traveled, a good tipper, and have a soft spot for service people."
Not this time.
"Rudeness is the same in every language and sadly, it´s what I´ll remember most about Can Majo."
This is another overrated guidebook illusion.
Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.
I have been to this restaurant several times as I love Mexican food but the last time was definitely the final straw.
"Way too expensive margaritas with little or no alcohol, food burnt to a cinder, inedible, again way overpriced for what could have been horse meat; chicken the same with no sauce to speak of; tiny portions of sides like sour cream, the salsa is a tasteless."
watery gloop with no chillis.
If you know nothing about real Mexican food (and even Taco Bell is better than here) and enjoy being ripped off then go by all means...
"Well worth the trip from either Vejer or the beaches of El Palmar, Canos etc."
We stay in Patria so can stagger back to the villa..... Family run restaurant - Thomas and Ase are Danish and live on site with their 2 kids - they speak fluent English.
Staff are local Patria ladies so we tried very hard with our Spanish!
We love this restaurant so much are scared to share it in case it becomes too popluar!
We return again to Patria this summer and are looking forward to visiting again.
They do a fixed price menu (about 22 Euros for 3 courses) and on a Sunday a really fabulous bbq with a buffet (return as you like).
Ase's wine recommendations are good.
The kids' menu is also good - not chicken nuggets!!
Forgot to mention - the view is amazing!
Will add photos later.
"Small, friendly and excellent restaurant tucked away at the top of the village of Orient (just past the church)."
It serves modern European food with an Indian twist.
Our highlight was sublime garlic mushrooms!
Our first visit to Javea and came upon this restaurant which opened last October and run by an English couple.
The restaurant itself is very modern in design with quality furniture.
"The food is excellent from starters to dessert, a glass of wine is provided for just 15 euros, amazing, give it a try you won't be disappointed."
"The chicken in pomegranate sauce that I had was delicious, as was my wifes salmon and you have to try their cheesecake, its the best I have ever tasted"
"Three course course lunch & dinner Home cooked by a great chef,  Choice of meat & fish, wonderful deserts, plus a glass of wine, all for 15 euros."
"Children welcome, high chairs provided."
Great atmosphere.
I saw the high ranking and thought this would be a great spot to try but we were all unimpressed.
It was just OK.
"The service was good, but the food was certainly nothing special."
I'd far rather enjoy the excellent local cuisine.
I went back to the reviews to see what on earth people liked and realized this place seems to be a hit with the French/Dutch expats but few others.
"Based on my experience, I would not recommend this restaurant."
Standard tapas / Spanish food.
Endives in roquefort sauce were overcooked in a thin and insipid sauce.
"Selection of ""tostados"" was better but nothing special."
Poor house wine.
"Only plus for us was no smoking, and not too busy."
"But you can eat much better, for less, at many places around here."
Four of us went to Mugaritz for a celebratory meal and had a wonderful time.
"The food was a real journey, full of unexpected surprises and mostly enjoyable although the odd dish did underwhelm us."
The sommelier recommended good local wines that were incredibly well priced (20 euros!).
The atmosphere was very lively as our fellow diners included a wedding party and a large group of neuro-scientists conducting some kind of 'experiment'.
"Despite this the staff were friendly and attentive, never once did we feel neglected."
"Before our meal we were taken into the kitchen to meet the chef and his staff, this small gesture really set the tone for an enjoyable afternoon."
We left nearly 6 hours later feeling very full and entirely satisfied with the amount we'd spent.
"Probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever had and compares favourably to places such as El Bulli, The Fat Duck and the like."
"The dishes taste of their ingredients but are clever, original and sometimes playful."
And I have to congratulate the Front of House for some of the best service I've received.
"Their ability to read their customers and act accordingly is second to none, probably surpassed only by the service I've receeved at El Bulli."
A wonderful restaurant.
Tucked slightly away on the edge of La Nogalera is this modern and stylish restaurant.
"The good points are undoubtedly the furniture, people watching (and in that area it can throw you a few surprises) and the general set up of the restaurant (excellent loos)."
However the food lets it down.
What there is is quite nice but limited.
"A vegetarian stir fry was broccoli,cashewnuts, peanuts, soy sauce and that was it for 7.50 euros."
"it was served on a small, but very pretty, plate so not even a reasonable portion."
"In a very competitive environment with so many restaurants within a few metres i would suggest having a drink there,(excellent for that) looking at what other people are eating before you make up your mind."
I consider it to be style over substance at the moment.
We went here because of all the great reviews.
"It is a very pretty restaurant with an upscale feel, but the food and service just were not that good."
"To start off, we ordered a glass of Cava."
There's nothing that annoys me more than when the pour is about a third of the glass and they they over-charge for the drink (6E each for low end Cava).
The wine with dinner was better.
As for the prix fixed 4 course meal - it was average at best.
"The salmorejo was strange, the tuna course was fishy, and the pork loin unmemorable."
"Worst off, they offered us a cheese course that the server said was included in the prix fixe,, but in reality they charged 8E more."
We didn't even want it.
"If you want my opinion, save your money and go have awesome food at Azafran, Enrique Becerra (tapas), Horacio, or Meson Pulpo; I would not go here again."
Casa Calvet is supposed to be one of Barcelona's top restaurant.
"Housed in one of Antoni Gaudi's first buildings, it is an elegant and pretensious room."
The food was a great disappointment.
"Started with a glass of undrtinkable vinegary white wine, which smelled awful and tasted worse."
The hostess acknowledged it and exchanged it to an acceptable Chardonnay.
"The menu card is short, with not many choices."
My wife could find only an appetizes as her meal.
"I selected the lamb, which was 90% fat and virtually no meat, accompanied by a few pieces of vegetables."
"The waityer took my plate, seeing that the lamb was mostly untouched, no questions asked if there was something wrong."
I left hungry.
This was to be our fanciest meal in Barcelona.
It turned out to be the only bad one.
We had our last night meal here and wow!
The setting is superb sitting in such an amazing moderist building but this is surpassed by the food.
"The Ajo Blanco was beautiful, the belly pork was sublime but the beetroot ice cream was out of this world :) Not cheap but worth every penny from the amuse bouche to the wine list was faultless."
Only issue we had was a loud american tourist at the booth behind us who felt she should share her thoughts with the restaurant but even she couldn't spoil it for us.
We have been going to Lanzarote for some time as my parents have a place there and we all agree that after visiting the place for 15 years now El Navarro is the best place on the island.
The food is always excellent and the father / daughter team that run the place are fantastic.
Always polite and taking the time to explain everything to you in detail should you ask.
The restaurant is perched on the side of the road but dont let that put you off the food is what you come for.
Living in london we are pretty spoilt for great places to eat but El Navarro could compete with anything outside of Michelin standard that we have here.
Whenever we snatch a quick week on the island we always go at least twice but remember to book as its popular!
"Best place for pintxos in all of Donosti, no doubt!!"
"But always busy, so if you can't take a bit of shoving or enjoy the friendly fight for a place in the ordering queue, then by all means leave this gem for the rest of us!"
The Food is good and cheeper.
Comida canaria casera y a muy buen precio.
Good food at a cheap price.
Local is very well decorated but portions are a bit little.
Short wine list.
"Nice tapas, if you are in to deep fried stuff like calamares, fish, Aspargus etc."
"The do have other things as well, but these are great as is."
"Also - try to get a seat outside in the ""sofa"" - very comfortable, with pillows galore :)"
best views on city
"only one menu, but a great one, modern spanish kitchen and what a view!"
Good place for a quick eat.
Wow!!
That literally sums up my meal here...
This of the beaten path asador is a must visit when in the basque country.
"Amazingly fresh produce, from the mountains and the sea, carefully prepared over an array of different charcoals and wine vines."
"Sea cucumber, BBQ'ed caviar, snails, red prawns, beef to die for and smoked milk desserts..."
I was lost for words and can't wait to return.
"So simple, so good."
"Be aware, that Etxebarri is open for lunch only during the week and for dinner on saturday nights."
"Needless to say, a reservation is required!"
"a little too ""fighetto"" in my opinion"
"best views, don´t expect to eat well"
"Awful service, tasteless food."
Total waste of time and money.
"Nice tapas in a nice atmosfaire, with Picasso´s drawings on the walls."
"good food, good price (90€ for two), from berasategui, however, no reservations"
Decent tapas in fine surroundings!
I used to like this restaurant.
"About three years ago the portions were great, the quality was great, and the atmosphere was fab."
"The food, the selection was great."
"Today, since being no longer sistered with Mijas Playa and now part of the Metro Group, it´s not as good."
"Still good, just not as good."
"Portions and selection have changed, atmosphere is still good as ever."
Solid **-Michelin restaurant in the wonderful town of Caceres.
"Food is prepared with french haute cuisine perfection and the menu consists of both local, spanish and foreign dishes, showing of great diversity."
"Service is among the best I've had in Spain and the wine list, though expensive, one of the best and most comprehensive."
"Can't wait for them to open their hotel and new restaurant in the old medieval part of town, so I have an excuse to revisit."
traditional food.
"excellent quality, somewhat pricey"
"There are four ""Glops"", and it is important not to get them confused."
"In Gracia, a fabulous neighbourhood to the north of the Ramblas lunacy, are two, The Taverna, and a new wine bar just around the corner."
"The wine bar offers great value for a pre-dinner stop, and the Taverna El Glop great food, a good atmosphere and a glimpse of the Catalan life of Barcelona."
"The menu is a touch confusing, and the English translation not entirely helpful."
Food is clustered under headings with pricing variables that leave one wondering if an item is a main course or a side dish.
"However, the ox tail stew is brilliant, the Catalan sausage fabulous, appetisers and vegetable perfect."
"A mammoth dinner for two, including a very good Galician white wine was EUR 65."
Having a house wine and a less expensive dish than ox tail would leave a couple weel satisfied with a bill closer to EUR 35.
"A great area, and wonderful restaurant."
Modern Lebanon Style food.
Nice place to be for veggies!
Defenitely try the Beirut Salad.
fantastic tapas at the bar.
great staff who are on top of their game.
can't wait to go back.
"The most wonderful meal i have ever had, even in uk!"
The place is very nice and stylish has outdoor seating for summer.
We go the quite alot for the lunch time special which is a starters each of small oniln barjis and chickin pakora (chicken peices in batter) with salad.
"then a main each (we had chicken corma and lamb masala) you get lots of rice and a nann bread each, you also get a side dish each (two to choose from, we had one of each) and a drink each all for about 12 euros, you get so much food and the quality is very hard to beat, i live 1/2 an hour from here and there must be around 20 indian restaurants closer to us and we have tried most of them, but none of them are a patch on Saritas and happily drive there to have the best Indian i have ever had the pleasure of eating in!!!!"
And thats Uk included!!!
Do not miss it.
"My family and I, having spent two weeks in Albir, Spain, want to acknowledge this restaurant as our favorite in Spain."
"Not only was the service impeccable and the food magnificent, but the staff was very pleasant as well."
I had the Vegetable Biryani (simply mahvelous) and it was a great introduction to Indian Cuisine.
"There are not too many visitors from the States, but we will pass the word among our friends."
"Mark and Pamela Lewack
Frederick, Maryland (DC Area)"
"If you eat here ask to go upstairs, it's nicer and if you are lucky you can sit on the balcony and look out at all the yachts in the harbour."
"The food here is American with typical burgers, steaks, fajitas etc."
"They have a childrens meal with choice of hamburger, chicken nuggets, fish fingers, hot dog or pizza with one drink and followed by ice cream for just under 12 euros so on the expensive side for the region."
"Our main meals were OK but not spectacular, I had the Cajun chicken my husband the Ribs and our daughter the Quesadilla."
The desserts on the other hand were GREAT.
"We shared the brownie sundae, chocolate fudge cake and the dime bar cheesecake - YUM YUM."
Total bill was on the high side considering we didn't have starters and comparatively to the local area although this restaurant is situated in Puerto Banus the Monaco of the area so prices at all the restaurants in the town are inflated.
Just got back from Marbella and came across this restaurant whilst out walking.
"Although its not in an ideal location next to the main busy road, this is quickly forgotten due to the relaxed atmosphere and the attentive and friendly staff."
"The menu had some great choices but both my wife and I were more than happy with our food, so much so."
we returned on a number of occasions during our stay.
Great value for money and a place and hope to return to in the future.
"This place is hidden in a side road behind the beach in Elviria, close to the beach house and Pepe's on the beach."
This is without doubt a hidden gem.
"The food is absolutely outstanding, highly recommend the prawns or deep fried camembert for starters."
"For main, the steak with Green pepper sauce is probably the best steak i have ever tried (we have eaten at most of the top restuarants along the coast here such as Oceana, Mijas Playa, The beach house, sloanes etc)."
Service and quality of food is absolutely outstanding and i can honestly say this is one of the best places to eat in the area.
Don't miss it!
"A hidden treaure,great service service,fantastic food,especially the steak,Poplu,i ar with Spanish and tourists i have gone for many years and look forward to going again soon,try it its a fabulous restaurant"
You will queue to get a table here almost anytime of night but it's worth the wait.
My husband and I shared an amazing gratinated aubergine with cheese and tomato and the children's homemade onion rings were also very tasty and plentiful.
There is no separate childrens menu so our had the pasta pesto and a chocolate filled pancake which they managed to finish so must have been good.
Our pizza's were excellent also (we had the Diabalo and the Bianca).
"The service was fine and the atmosphere very good, the price was fine compared to most european restaurants although was more pricey than many andalusian restaurants."
"This restaurant is located in Puerto Banus, however, (the Monaco of the area complete with large yachts and fast cars) so it is to be expected that the price is inflated."
nice staff when i whas there
Visited this restaurant this weekend with my daughter and friends.
"The food was pleasant,but the service was the worst I have ever received."
"My daughter's friend received the wrong meal, when ordering she had asked for the clams to be substituted by shrimps."
"They were unhappy, but took the meal away and returned 15 minutes later with a totally different meal (with a cream sauce and shrimps) by which time we had all finished our meals."
"She was prepared to eat that meal, but felt that we should not be charged for it."
"The management did not apologise for their error, in fact,  he said the waiter had not understood and implied that the problem was ours and not theirs."
The manager sent over the bill and cleared the remainder of the table whilst my daughter's friend was still eating her meal.
"I asked to speak with him again and explained why I was dissatisfied, asking why he had cleared the table he said he did not want to serve us any more food and he was busy and walked away."
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
We paid for the remaining three meals (which cost us 70 euros).
"A  well established, family run, French/ International restaurant  located beside the Mediteranean beach with excellent sea views."
An extensive menu is offered.
reserved parking area.
Closed tuesdays.
We had one of our first Barcelona meals here.
"It was mid day, we were tired from jet lag and exploring and dropped into this convenient location for some food."
It did the job.
The staff was accomodating to no spanish speakers and the menu was easy.
I'd go back for sure.
You could easily plan a stop here while sight seeing as the location is between Gotic and Born neighborhoods.
It is about 1km off La Rambla too.
One of the best tapas place of Madrid... 1st quality products!
Bastante buen marisco
I ate here with my parents last Sunday evening on the back of many recommenddations and was utterly disappointed.
The Irish manager/ Maitre De was uninterested and actually quite rude - she seemed put out that we were dining at the restaurant.
"The goats cheese starter was good, however the salmon main course and the chicken main course had no flavour whatsoever, completely bland."
The dessert of a pear tart with vanilla milkshake was so so - nothing special.
Again lacking any kind of flavour.
All in all it was a very bad dining experience - with so many restaurants in the Orange Square area i wouldn't waste your time with The Orange Tree.
After reading reviews on trip advisor we were not disappointed when we visited here for an evening meal.
Situated opposite Puerto Rico beach offered a more relaxed setting than found in the typical main centre.
"The staff were very friendly and extremely attentive, our waiter could not do enough for us and even offered to teach us some Spanish!"
We shared tapas dishes as we wanted a more authentic Spanish meal than the meat and chips on offer everywhere else.
We were not disappointed.
Having frequented various tapas restaurants at home our high expectations were exceeded by the meal we enjoyed here.
All dishes were delicious and I'd especially recommend the chorizo and albondigas dishes.
"As usual we looked up previous reviews to find better restaurants than the standard ""British Menus"" offered in the main Puerto Rico precinct."
We were not disappointed!
"Although approximately twice as expensive as on the main drag, the food, presentation, and staff service was first class."
We ate there twice during our two week stay and would recommend Caballito de Mar to anyone.
Three course meal and two bottles of house wine for 4 people came to €150 and there was no rush to get us out when finished.
We ate here 3 times on our recent trip to GC.
We had dinner one evening with 15 people and the food was really nice and the staff were so friendly.
We went back once more for lunch and then again for dinner.
They do an awesome Caprese Salad and the lamb is mouthwatering!
This was our favourite place to eat
"eaten there few times and each time the food is very tasty, wholesome and very good value for money."
`Tony` the owner is very accommodating and nothing is too much trouble .
Look forward to seeing him this year !
lorengos has been by far the best priced restaurant in the resort this year I took some advise from deneise at the exchange the x pats always give you great comments anyone visiting lorengos I hav'nt tasted a pitsa like it before try the tropicana.also the sea bass comes spain style the staff have to be praised they would just put some sardines on the table and let you try I.ve been to the resort the last 5 yearsand it takes alot to impress me
This is the restaurant where Zortziko started before it moved.
"Same family cooks the food here and is truly outstanding, although less elaborate than it's offspring."
It is more bistro style but ambience and food excellent without breaking the bank.
This is one of the oldest and most well known restaurants in the seafood district of Carihuela in Torremolinos.
"What to expect; if you come during highseason they are very busy, lots of guests and lots of staff and lots happening in general."
"However, the quality of the food never fails."
For a starter I would say any of their salads are great and large and their gambas pil-pil is fantastic.
They offer a seafood platter (mariscada) which is out of this world and a must if you come to Casa Juan.
If you feel it is a bit on the pricey side then I would recommend the paella.
This is one of the few places on the Costa del Sol where you can still get a traditional good paella instead of the tourist version offered in so many places nowadays.
"If you fo not feel like peeling shells and getting your fingers dirty I would recommend the Paella Ciega which come ""ready to eat"" not work involved."
Shellfish not your thing.. well then they have a wide offer of fish and even some meatdishes which are also outstanding.
Service is quick and efficient but you don't feel rushed or ignored.
Price is surprisingly good.
"Ambiance, well it doesn't have the school diner feel that you can find in so many proper Spanish restaurants but it certainly isn't a romantic place either."
I would say action and great food is what you can expect here.
Sat outside in the garden.
"We had a trainee waiter which is ok, but lead to a few misunderstandings."
"Food was not very special, the fish was not properly fileted with loads of bones and the lambchops were small and not very delicate."
"Dessert was ok, but vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce became chocolate icecream with no sauce...."
"Pleasant bar, comfortable, but not very welcoming, and a little pricey, main downfall the staff/owners, good wine list"
"Superb setting, looking directly over the port."
"Big candles lit at night, and saxaphonist playing romantic music."
"Menu includes typical spanish tapas and full meals, but also sort of oriental tapas - chicken in peanut sauce, homemade spring rolls with a lovely spicy dip etc."
Food and ambiance was excellent - every table was full and seeemed very popular.
Would definately recommend.
"Visited San Seb last month and once we discovered this place, we could not pass it by without going in."
"We ate at some of the Michelin starred places and despite having no frills, the cooking at Cuchara was up there with the best of them."
Their octopus was the best I've ever tasted and the veal and foie gras were sublime.
Can't recommend it highly enough.
"I hate to buck a trend, but what I saw in San Seb was a number of unknown places really pushing their game and producing amazing food, but Cuchera was not one of them."
"A couple of dishes were amazing, but it was packed, service was unpleasant and most of the food produced by 2 lads who seemed keener on cocking around."
A place that has perhaps been allowed to rest on it's laurels?
If it were possible I would give La Cuchara 6 out of 5.
I had read the reviews prior to eating there but they still did not prepare for how fantastic the food really is.
The scallops were cooked to perfection and probably the best I´ve ever had.
The lamb melted in my mouth and even an uncomplicated dish like risotto was incredibly flavoursome with a lingering taste of more.
You simply can not go to San Sebastian and not eat here!
"I should warn you that it will be packed to the rafters and it is standing only (there is limited seating outside), but if you want delicious tapas at a very affordable price then this is where to go and go again and again and again...."
"We had just arrived in the wonderful town of Hondarribia, staying at the beautiful Parador."
It was 10 pm and we were hungry...walked down the block to what looked to be a great restaurant.
"The place was 1/2 empty, but a young lady treated us poorly since we did not have a reservation."
She sat us down and then ignored us.
"Another couple walked in, with reservations, got a welcome drink, bread, and menus right away."
We waited a few more minutes to get the menus...still nothing.
"Walked out and emailed the manager, who has since apologized."
This experience left us a bad taste in our mouth.
Walked up to the plaza outside the Parador and had a wonderful grilled merluza in a gorgeous setting.
Stay away from Sebastian!
"In Spain, the ""menu del dia"" (daily menu) can be ordered between 1:30 and 4:00 on average."
"A menu consists of a primero (a first course), a segundo (a second course), brough out after the primero, and then dessert or coffee."
"Also, bread and a drink option of either water, beer or wine are included."
You are able to choose betwen various items for your primero and segundo.THe average menu price in Spain right now is 11 Euros.
La finca de Susana's menu is at 9.50 and therefore a good bargain for the great setting and excellent food.
I ordered the paella as my primero and beef cheeks in gravy with cous cous for my segundo.
The paella was very good with lots of meat and sea food.
Teh beef cheeks were tender and yummy but lacked a little salt.
My wife had a salad with hardboiled eggs stuffed with tuna and crab as her primero.
"For her segundo, she ordered the vinager chicken with vegetables and french fries."
(Note that most foods in Spain come with french fries no matter where you go.
"Also, you don't ever know that you are getting french fries until they show up along with you course) Overall the food was excellent and PLENTIFUL."
The service was not over the top great but you are in Spain and no one really cares about you here.
THey aren't working for tips so don't be angry if no one falls all over themselves to be your best friend...
"our last night in Madrid, we read about this place...doesn't open till 8.30 for dinner...very pretty and pleasant, soothing decor, white tablecloth ambience, great food and prices!"
"Excellent finish to our trip, happy memory."
"The one negative: when we were all done eating / drinking, waitress didn't come back at all to see if we were ready for check, we had to catch her eye...eventually....across the room."
I'd certainly go back.
This restaurant was the eating highlight of our visit to Barcelona.
"In fact, as we enjoyed the experience so much the first time we went back again."
We followed the suggestions of Marcos with the menu and the wine.
The food was outstanding and the service excellent.
It was very personalised and friendly.
We did not have any difficulty finding the restaurant.
It was good value.
We booked this restaurant after reading Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed.
"We celebrated our Silver Wedding with friends in June 2009 and the food, the wine, the ambience and the service were excellent."
We still talk about the whole experience even now and I have recommended this resaurant to other people.
"I only hope a bigger place will not spoil the very personal, knowledgable and friendly service that added to our most enjoyable and unforgetable evening."
"Not cheap, but worth every penny paid and this makes it good value for money."
All six of us will definitely eat here again.
"We ate at Montiel after seeing it was highly rated on Tripadvisor, we were not disappointed."
"The restaurant is small and quaint, very intimate."
"The location can be a bit hard to find and our cab driver had a little difficulty finding it, it helps to Google map it and find out the cross streets since cabs cars can’t drive down the street the restaurant is on."
"The food was excellent, I had a pork tenderloin that was slow cooked for hours, very tender and flavorful."
My wife sampled a couple of the tapas vegetable dishes and they were also great.
I would recommend the potatoes with the various sauces.
Marcos is very knowledgeable with his wine list and can suggest a good paring or a wine suited to your tastes.
"Not sure where the expensive comments are coming from, I found it very reasonable."
"We had the equivalent of 2 meals, a nice bottle of wine, 1 dessert and a glass of dessert wine for 100 Euro."
Where I’m from that’s a bargain for a great meal!
Get there early when they open (8 PM) or make a reservation.
The service is poor the food is terrible .
"Come to the restaurant whit small acceptations and I have to say the food was crap the meat wasn’t even cook properly, and the service was terrible."
NEWER GONA SITT MY FOOT IN THAT RESTURANT AGEN
Rancho Blanco used to be the best restaurant in Torrevieja.
Unfortunately it's popularity has become it's own downfall.
The service is indifferent and the food nothing special - and considering the mediocrity and potential toxicity that is the norm of the catering competition in Torrevieja that is a great shame.
It's not cheap and it's not particularly good any more - but it still has the best location and the potential to be something truly exceptional and if you have never been it still deserves a visit.
If you set your expectations low enough you may yet have a pleasant surprise.
Cafe Aroma is one of my favourite lunch stopa as it is just of the beach and I don't have to give up too much time from my sun bathing.
The service is really friendly and you always get greeted with a huge smile from the owners.
I can recommend the salads as they are the only place where you can get a good sized FRESH salad with everything you like and nothing you don't (you can order it exactly how you like it without feeling awkward)... A great place to go for the quick but healthier lunch then Burger King...
"Cafe Aroma is a unique sandwich and cake cafe which also seem to cater to any of your other needs, on our visit to playa blanca we visited the cafe four times and was delighted with the quality of the food."
"Sandwiches, cakes, jacket potatoes and great coffee."
Pleasant staff who try harder than most to provide good quality.
Highly recommended and small enough to care.
Will go again on our next visit :-)
"I have eaten at Cafe Soller many times, and to be honest I have found the food to be of good quality, a bottle of house wine(white,rose,red) are all 11.00 euros a bottle and very drinkable, a very good selection of salads at reasonable prices, not too keen on the atmosphere inside, it's rather like eating in a library, but outside in the plaza has a buzz, crab salad very good at 8.00euros, only one bad experience when euro 2008 was on, in the final no none germans were allowed in the bar to watch, I heard from some people they were most annoyed, but that does not cloud the issue of the food."
"it's designed as a one time place for tourists, it achieves that."
"If you find yourself in the area of the Bena Vista complex,between San Pedro and Estepona,looking for somewhere special for dinner this restaurant is head and shoulders above the rest...trust me, over twenty years I've tried pretty much all of them."
"Let's start with the location,on a hiil just past the El Paraiso hotel overlooking the coast,the restaurant is housed in an old manor house, with the tables set out spaciously on the terrace outside,shaded by lovely old trees.The tables are immaculately set with good quality cutlery and generous glasses on crisp linen."
"Next ,the menu.Interesting and well balanced,with a judicious mix of fish,poultry and meat, plus a vegetarian choice,all with a slight twist."
"The sea-food soup,for example,is served in a nice big dish which comes with just a little selection of shellfish and rouille,over which the waiter ladles the soup from a tureen.Superb."
"Of the mains, the oxtail is a killer ,the crispy duck,off the bone ,is a dream and the sole with prawns is to die for."
"As if that was not enough,there are little extras that make a meal at Ramos really delightful.As you are perusing the menu the waiter will bring you a few little 'amuse gueles',smoked salmon on little bread triangles and little cups of gaspachio."
With you after dinner coffee he will appear with a selection of complimentary petits fours AND offer you a drink on the house.
"The waiters are all professionals,friendly,gracious and discreet......not students stumbling through a Summer job !"
"And ,on top of all that, the bill will not stick in your throat."
"This restaurant,for the style,the quality of food and the ambience,is, for my money, the best value on the coast .Go,eat and enjoy!"
"We ate yesterday at Cinq Sentits, and having dined around the world, can rate this as possibly the best meal I have ever had."
"The service was impeccable, but unpretentious -knowledgeable about the foods and wines, but never cloying."
"The foie gras was truly spectacular, as was the iberian suckling pig cooked sous vide."
The focus on local ingredients cooked to reflect their origins was apparent throughout.
The wines were carefully chosen and a perfect accompaniment to the 65 Euro tasting menu.
The multilingual staff were able to explain the dishes and wines in perfect English.
"Given the calibre of the food, the meal was an exceptional value."
The michelin star is well earned (and well on a way to a second I would suspect) .
I will undoubtedly revisit Cinq Sentits every future trip to Barcelona.
The food is great (especially the atrtar de Atun) but reservation in advance is highly recomended!
It is not easy to get a table.
From the moment you set foot until the moment you leave this restaurant is perfection.
"The ambiance, the attention to detail, the knowledgable staff are just some of the factors that make dining here such a pleasure."
"The menu is varied and interesting without being pompous, the wine list offers a wide and very adequate selection."
"Their fish and seafood is delicious and the meat is of very high quality and very well prepared, I would however not recommend this restaurant as a place with a wide choice for vegetarians."
The deserts are stunningly good and if you like chocolate do try the white chocolate tower with the truffle mousse which is simply amazing.
Apart from all the above I can say that we have a person with gluten intolerance in our midst and the staff ensured that she was well informed of what was safe for her to eat and furthermore they adapted the aperetif to her.
Small details but very appreciated.
"The location is central, right by the church, I would recommend to sit in the courtyard for a more intimate ambiance and at nighfall the lightgarlands make this a magical place."
So many little touches and having been there three times in the last 3 weeks so far nothing has failed.
I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant!
We visited this restaurant because of good reviews.
We arrived at 6.25 (for the 6.30 official opening time) when staff were finishing the set up but were told MOST RUDELY that they would not be open for at least another hour.
"On our next attempt we had to wait for an outside table (that was not a problem); however once again we found the staff very off-hand, surly and rude."
"After waiting for 40 minutes to get a table, we felt unduly rushed."
"Whe we asked for a bottle of mineral water, the waiter claimed they had none."
The tapas were average and the price reasonable.
Other restaurants we visited offered much pleasanter service and better value for money.
"We arrived at La Cueva and felt like we were regulars their because we were treated well and even got to pick our table next to the fountain in the plaza, what peace and with the walls of the palace within view it was easy to drift back in time a thousand years."
The lamb was the best I ever had and everyone of us enjoyed our meals very much.
The owner himself greeted us and thank us for our stay and even recommended a good place to eat across the river for our evening meal.
We all decided to come back to La Cueva before returning to the US.
Yes its a little expensive but you truly get what you pay for.
This place came recommended to me by a friend who visited Seville this past year.
After walking through the beautiful cobblestone streets we found La Cueva.
Wow!
Tucked away from the tourist areas this place was exactly what we were looking for.
We sat in the patio and enjoyed the truly authentic meal my friend had raved about.
The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was welcoming.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seville looking for great food and a wonderful time.
"We found this restaurant on TripAdvisor on the third day of our stay in Barcelona and went there almost every day despite waiting in a queue for 10-15 minutes, as the food is really tasty and the value is superb."
"We liked everything about the place, but for service!"
Waitresses are never smiling and one of them with such an arrogant face as if we're beggars who broke in to steal the food from her fridge.
Moreover one day we were waiting for about 35 minutes to make an order.
"I even came to a woman who was the manager or something, but this didn't help."
The arrogant-faced waitress was meanwhile putting clothes and candles on free tables and behaving as if we are invisible.
Thus would highly recommend the owner to instruct the staff accordingly.
"For sure, you have enough visitors now, but with such a service it won't last forever."
I really enjoyed this restaurant.
It has outside seating which is pleasantly on the plaza Nova square next to the Barcelona Cathedral.
"However, my husband and I chose to sit inside most of the time."
We went there every morning for breakfast during our stay.
The service was quick and the staff was pleasant.
"The Spaniards are not big on breakfast, but they do have an American breakfast menu."
It's really not american at all.
I ordered American toast and got a half of a delicious roll with tomatoes spead on it and topped with cheese.
"It was good, but not what you'd expect for an American breakfast."
I suggest a cappucino and a croissant (freashly made every morning).
We also had lunch and dinner on seperate occasions.
For lunch we enjoyed a wide variety of tapa's at a very reasonable price.
I liked being able to point to the foods that I wanted to try.
I recommend the crab sticks if you like crab.
"We washed all of these tapas down with cava, the Spanish version of champaign."
For dinner we spilt a salad (more than enough for two).
We each also had a pasta dish that was good.
"This is not a 5 star restaurant, but the location is great, food is good, the prices affordable, the staff is friendly and the service is speedy."
"The Greatest Irish Pub In Town‎ - Brian Gordon‎ - Jul 10, 2009 There are many Irish pubs in Madrid some good some bad, I've tried most."
"The worst; the name of which I'll not mention, where the barkeeper reacted to my question ""Do you speak English?"""
"with mouth agape, as if I had asked for a pint of sparrows sperm."
The best; the name of which I will mention is The James Joyce.
The staff all speak English some like the manager and the owner are Irish.
"All are very friendly and efficient and the beer is always at the right temperature, in cooled glasses on request."
"To correct a previous review there are 3 large TV's and live music, including Irish on Fridays and Saturdays."
Ate here twice during our stay in May 09.
1st time a group of 5 we chose a banquet meal for 5 which could have fed 10 and only 10 euros each!
A whole crispy duck was just one of the courses and definately one of their specialitys.
"Went back again just two of us before we left, had to have more of that duck so just the half this time, excellant."
"We go to Benidorm regularly so will definately never go to another Chinese, say no more"
"The food is good, but the combination of the food with the flamenco is great!"
"This place has a lot of ""spirit"" wonderful atmosphere - perhaps a but more upscale than the other flamenco bars in town, but just so wonderful!"
"Nowadays it s difficult to find places like this one, where quality and simplicity prevail amongst anything else."
"Kupela was taken over by new management about 10 years ago now, and it s impressive how the team keeps the same levels of quality and passion every day."
"The restaurant focuses on good product with unsophisticated preparations, ensuring that you ""taste the quality""."
"This is a basque ""asador"" where you can still eat and not be ripped off as in many others in Madrid."
"Do not miss the ""pencas rellenas"" (stuffed thistle), ""rape a la brasa"" (charcoal grilled monkfish), the octopus salad and the T bone."
"In terms of wines, the selection is not long but it has a very good variety of classic Riojas: V Alberdi & V Ardanza, together with Solar Viejo, Albina and others."
Closed on sundays and Monday night  javi delgado
"We just had dinner for my birthday in Cafe the Paris, probably the most renown restaurant in town."
We had the pleasant surprise of a special menu for 45 € just launched to attract more patrons to the web of gastronomic restaurants in Malaga province.
The entrees were very varied and exquisite ( the langoustines carpaccio comes quickly to mind) and the main dishes were also of excellent quality and high originality.
"The desserts were very good too, particularly the 5 state chocolate (solid, liquid as crème, crumbled, iced and powdered)."
The wine selection is quite wide for spanish wine although I would have welcomed more regional wines from Andalusia.
"The sumillier there was quite experienced and proof of that was that our wine was always at the right temperature, never cold nor warm."
We had our teas with chocolate truffles ad libitum.
It was a very good experience for about 65 € per head in a Michelin starred restaurant
Been coming here for years - were there last week.
Fantastic as ever.
Best fillet steak we've ever had.
Try the sombrero (looks like a witches hat) for something really really different.
Had a dinner with my friends in this Taverna and we were delighted by the meals we were served.
We live on the other side of the island of Mallorca from this wonderful restaurant.
But we make the trek over there 4 or 5 times a year.
"A Mallorquin family own and run the restaurant to a standard that you don't often find here, unfortunately."
The daughter is a chef who trained in New York at the Restaurant WD-50.
So the food is excellent.
The last time we were there we had the 5 plate tasting menu for 40 euros per person.
For the quality of the meal for the price was ridiculously cheap.
"As a comparison, the food was of a much higher standard than either of the Gordon Ramsey restaurants I have eaten at in London and New York."
"The food may not be the most authentic, but this place is lovely and delicious!"
I enjoyed the pad thai immensely - their sauce to go along with it can move mountains - it is that good...some of their other things are okay....but I recommend the pad thai...
I recently came back from Spain and did spend a few days in Barcelona.
To be honest this was my favorite place to have lunch.
"Although it gets really crowded and it does become hard to get noticed by the bartender at times, the food, the cavas and the environment completely make up for it."
"The sandwiches are the best ones I've had in my life, try the ""Blanco y Negro"" and there is one with ""butifarra"", and the price is just unbelievable: you can get three sandwiches and a bottle of cava (champagne) for less than 15 euros."
I LOVED IT
Poor restaurant with a poor meat.
This place isn't worth going.
We have been visiting Portobello many times during the last 2 years.
"We like the kitchen, the view and the staff, but last time we visited the place the host was most likely drunk and very rude to us."
Sad that we have to say good buy to a place we have previously appreciated.
I think it is time for the host to retire.
We went twice - each time ordering totally different things.
You cannot beat this place.
The tapas are fantastic.
Literally everything we got was delicious.
The restaurant is full of chic Madrilenos.
Always packed.
"I recommend the sangria, too."
Lots of great recommendations for this well situated tapas bar so we went to see if we would be impressed.
Well we weren't.
You had the usual goodnatured queue for seats which seemed to stretch out for some 20 or so folks.
We could deal with that but smoking is a real problem and this place is below ground level and on a warm evening fairly close.
After a wait of probably 30 minutes we were given (thankfully) a table out on the sidewalk.
Overall we found the food greasy and unappealing.
The tomato stroked bread is a real joke and should be removed from tapas menus worldwide.
No comparison with the all star Cal Pep.
Why put yourself through this one.
"Innovative, modern reasonably priced... my recommendation."
Robata is the option for something more 'classic' and more expensive.
Made the mistake of arriving at 10:00 pm (no reservations)- and waited on line for 45 minutes to get table.
Tapas Bar from Commerc 24- very creative and extensive choices ranging from roasted asparagus to prawns in garlic.
"Great crowd, clearly taken with the food and the casual setting."
We loved Mayura.
The interior is really funky but relaxed.
We were there as a couple but the majority were groups of 4 to 6.
The food was amazing (try the confit duck and the mango lassi!)
and we were lucky to be there on a Bollywood night where they had Indian dancers entertain at random times throughout the evening.
Made us want to head to india for our next holiday!
"Prices very reasonable - around €7 for a starter, €12 for a main, €5 for a dessert and €11 for a bottle of wine."
We'll be back.
"Very limited menu but everything cooked for you fresh, various fish."
"Decided to be brave and have octupus, I had a whole one deep fried on my plate, delicious."
Brave again had the cuttle fish which I enjoyed.
"Superb chips, excellent chicken wings."
All the food is good and very reasonably priced.
"Three or four tapas between two of us a salad and chips and two glasses of wine, 22 euros."
"Downside, the owners can sometime be a little above themselves and tend to make a fuss ot their canarians friends at the expense of the tourists."
Ate here twice between the 7th July and the 14th July.
The food is very good and as per the title excellent value for money.
"We have been to Los Cristianos quite a few times before but this restaurant was just recommended recently, you would not stumble across it as it is up and alley between a couple of shops with no sign on the main street."
"It was always full the 2 times we were in, mostly with Spanish customers."
This in itself is a goods sign as most other restaurants were practically empty.
The menu is very small and predominately grilled fish.
"We tried the sardines, prawns, hake and chicken wings these were all lovely and very fresh."
For 2 fish dishes and sides of chips and salad and a bottle of wine it cost around 35 euros.
This is by no means a posh place but if you enjoy fresh fish simply cooked I would definitely recommend it.
This is a place we stumbled upon and were pleasantly surprised.
It is off of a nice little plaza by a big church.
The food was creative italian.
"The service was great, the prices were totally reasonable."
I'd go back for sure.
i have been to this restaurant so many times and never had a bad meal  it is one of the best places in fuengriola staff are so nice and friendly albert antonio felma and antonio snr all very very nice and go out of their way to make you comfortable and an enjoyable meal  will always return
Don't be put off (or actually do!)
by the basic decoration and the ruthless service!
This is just a hidden gem!
Don't be put off ( or just do!)
by the decoration and what appears to be ruthless yet genuine and firendly staff.
It's a hidden gem for seafood in Madrid.
On our first evening in Las Americas we went to The Monkey Bar & Grill to eat.
We had been there before for drinks but not to eat.
We both ordered a steak with all the trimmings.
"We waited approx 10 minutes to be served, placed our order then waited another 20-30 minutes for our meal."
"The steaks were obviously very cheap cuts, they were just warm and tasteless."
The salad was limp and the fries were soggy!
"Not impressed at all, the service was poor and we were surrounded by smokers!"
"Sorry, we will definately not be eating here again."
"One thing we must give praise for is that they serve their drinks in very nice glasses and are well presented, although a little more expensive that some of the other bars."
I hosted a casual business dinner here for 10 persons.
"Staff is not particularly friendly, but they are efficient."
"Cost was about 53 euros per person for three course meal, including wine- which is Barcelona is not expensive."
"Excellent starters, good portions for mains."
"It is a splurge, but good place to hang out on warm summer evening."
"It is a bit loud, like m ost restaurants, so not great for conversation."
"Well, I have visited this restaurant many different times in the last 10 years while in Barcelona for business or vacation."
"You will find great food, a fast but efficient service and a great atmosphere."
"Go there for dinner with friends, a romantic one (get a booth inside) or for a great lunch on a week end: you will not be disappointed."
Surely it's not hte cheapest place in town but you pay for the quality.
"You will find a lot of locals, a confirmation of the overall quality of this place."
Enjoy it!
"I've been to this restaurant twice, and both times I was disappointed."
The first time I went because this place has a lovely view and it is supposedly renown for its food.
The second time I returned on a business dinner and couldn't avoid it.
There is not going to be a third time for sure.
Both times the bad experience started at the door.
"They treat you like a nuisance, never mind if you booked in advance."
Hard to get good tables and the service is poor to say the least.
"On this last visit we sat down at the same time of a couple besides us, we were done with our main course and they where still waiting for the appetizers."
They were furious as they weren't getting any attention while we felt the pressure to leave quickly.
"Which doesn't mean our service was pleasantly fast: the waiter literally took away our plates while we where still eating, without asking if we were done with the meal!Food was dumped on the table, I noticed that while we were eating our appetizers the main course was sitting on table nearby, getting cold."
"Every time the waiter was pouring wine he was spilling it on the tablecloth, he didn't know good manners."
"Besides being expensive, well above the area average, food was way too salty, The worst came at the end, when we asked for the check: there were more drinks than those we ordered, We called the waiter and he didn't allow us to explain what was wrong, bringing immediately back a revised check."
"Which made us think that he knew from the start what was wrong with it... Whatever happened there, if felt dodgy."
"Food is not worth the price you pay for it, but the big issue of this place is definitely service."
Spare yourself a disappointment: don't go is my advice.
Someone said in the review this is the best tourist trap in Madrid and i can only agree!
"The Botin is obviously a place for tourists, but you wont regret going there!"
"We made reservations in the tables in the 'cave' and that´s was pretty cool, you feel you were in the 17th century."
"The service was very nice anda the food, amazing!"
"We knew the portions would be big, so we orderer one pork and one lamb for three people."
"I touhgt they would bring the two plates and thenm we would share, but they brought one plate for each one of us, with a piece of lamb and a piece of pig, it was so nice and so good... both where amazing."
"I loved the place, the atmosphere and the food, I´m definitly coming back!"
"After having dinner there, go walking to the strees with a lot of bars near there, in La Latina, speacially in the Txacolina tapas place, a very nice bar."
"Great food, wonderful house wine and so much history.. We loved it, Cochinillo, cordero, ensalada riojana..all excellent"
"This place is full of atmosphere, efficient waiters,and fantastic portions of crunchy bread served with your meal."
"However, the suckling pig was awful."
"Carved at the table, it promises so much but delivers so little."
90% of it was semi soft crackling and the remainder was very fatty slimy pork with very little taste.
It came with 2 very small roast potatoes.Very expensive.
Got to do it once...
According to Guinness Book of Records the oldest restaurant in the world.
Situated just off Plaza Mayor....must have the suckling pig........cannot say anymore
The atmosphere here is great!
"In spite of its touristy location, you will find locals here!"
"Downstairs, see if you can get a peek at the partially earthed bodega!"
"I am not sure what century it dates back to, but it is wonderful the way it has been preserved and is a part of the cafe, albeit a semi-private room!"
We had lunch here in July 2009.
We sat outside.
It is hard to describe just how perfect this setting is.
It is on a street blocked off to cars overlooking a gorgeous garden in front of the royal palace.
All the buildings are old and beautiful.
"The food was great, service was perfect."
Menus in english on request.
we were staying not far frm here and came on all the nights we were in madrid.
Its go such a lovely relaxed atmospere.
"we sat outside on the terrace with views to the palace and if i didnt have to come home, i'd still be sitting there just now!"
"we sat in the cafe part rather than the restaurant, and had the house red which was a rioja and very reasonably priced at around €16."
"the waiting staff were really friendly and attentive, always smiling."
"the food we had, which was mostly tapas were all delicious, and i have to say that any other food we seen being delivered to other tables looked great too."
I'd definitley recommend this place to anyone visiting madrid.
its open until around 1.30am and i think they serve food until then as everyone seemed to eat very late over there.
"If you go try the helado con leche, which is like a cream flavoured creamy ice cream!"
it was the best ice cream i've ever had and the little touch of cinnamon on top made it all the nicer.
"The helado's are around €5.50 which isn't cheap, but theres enough for two, so get two spoons!"
"we loved it here, it was just perfect."
"This is a typical local restaurant which serves great, local food: simple and tasteful."
For 12 (!)
"Euro's a person we had a complete lunch with main course, dessert and a full bottle of excellent red house wine."
"We're planning to have dinner here as well, hopefully on one of these romantic tables on the stairs."
This was a real find for our small group that included vegetarians.
The location is amazing.
Dining outdoors on the steps that lead to the San Domenic.
Be sure to get there before 8:00pm to get a table.
The staff was friendly and helped translate the Catalan to Spanish & English.
All the tables around us seemed to be enjoying it just as much as we did.
"Fresh salads, bread style pizzas, huge plates of fresh tomatoes and cheese and bread, pastas, crepes and refreshing sorbets."
"The bill for our table of four with starters, dinner, dessert and wine was less than 60 euro."
Most impressive.
This is by far the best known restaurant in Segovia.
We visited it 20 years ago and it was amazing.
We came back to Segovia recently and had high expections.
"The restaurant is still very good, but not a great as we remembered."
"Some of the highlights of our meal were the suckling pig, which is still tender and delicious, the owner came and met us personally, and because we made reservations to sit upstairs, we had a great view of the Roman aquaducts."
"We highly recomend the pig, but do not order the crab soup (it's more of a bisque) or the veal loin."
No one enjoyed the soup because it was too strong and the veal was just ok.
"very friendly staff, good food, drink and service, prices are good also.House steak is to die for so tasty and tender, i would recommend this restuarant to everyone.We go to Torrevieja 3 or 4 times a year and eat at La Casona most nights."
I cn only assume that this restaurant is resting on very old laurels.
"Let me put it this way: the walls are festooned with pictures of celebrities, mostly now aged or defunct."
"The service was perfunctory, the food mediocre."
"The 'suckling' lamb was chewy, bony and tasteless; the pork was tender but tasteless."
Both came unaccompanied by anything else except a sea of oil.
"We had infinitely superior roast pork the previous night in the Parador at La Granja for about the same price, but with far better service and more accompaniments."
"The big thing here is the view, but that can be had free from the square outside!"
"MOST disappointing,"
we were rushed to our seats their was no customer service four of us got a chicken curry which was cold and it tasted like a tv dinner really bad and terrible value we didnt go back to this place .
We went to this restaurant twice during our stay in Nerja and it was excellent.
"The starter salads were huge and delicious, the fillet steak is very good and the sangria very strong ."
The interior is very traditional and i would recommend eating inside rather than outside on the street .
Lastly i have to mention our waiter Miguel.He was fantastic - very friendly and attentive and made the dining experience even better.
"We have been eating at Meson Antonio on our annual visits for a few years now and what we have noticed is every year for the last two or three times, the female staff have got more and more miserable,the male staff rush about more with little interest of what you want to eat but how fast they can get the money off you and get you out of the door,the food ,beef in particular doesn't seem to be of the high quality."
"The only thing that has remained the same is the old man in the kitchen (the owner maybe) still coming out of the kitchen at regular intervals for a portion of jamon, same attitude same smile and same ola, pity the rest of the staff are not the same."
Decent tapas with great service!
convenient location at the top of la rambla.
DELICIOUS tapas and sangria con cava!
can't say enough about how good this food was.
YUM!
"We had a jug of tasty sangria, a bruschetta dotted with chorizo and delicious grilled squid for lunch, which came to EUR30, but when combined with the view, the atmosphere and music it was well worth it"
The Curry Club really stands out in San An.
"There are many cheap, low quality restaurants around the town but The Curry Club is different."
"A wide selection of dishes, chilled out atmosphere and excellent staff..."
Recommended to all!
We've been going to Los Higuitos for years.
"They serve wonderful tapas and we also enjoy lunch--especially the divine tomato, avocado, and tuna salad."
The restaruant itself is tiny but most patrons sit under the trees in the plaza outside.
It's in a pedestrian area right near the daily market.
"Get yourself a tinto de verano (like a red wine spritzer) and enjoy the tapa while contemplating the limited, yet tasty, menu."
"We had the worst experience , ever!"
"Recommended by our hotel, we were impressed by its outside presentation."
However something was wrong.
"We chose the veal medallions, which were not veal, that much I can assure you..."
In fact just the memory of the texture and the smell is still giving us shivers.
"We are still discussing which kind of meat, it was ...We were served by a chinese family, who rushed to get our plates out of the table, without even asking if something was wrong, when we said we would not finish our plates after taking two bites."
"In retrospect, we had the definite impression that the staff wanted to hide the food from the manager, to whom we spoke on our way out."
The restaurant opened at 9h00 pm.
"We went in at 9h05, were served our appetizers 3 min after."
"The veal was served at 9h20, we were out after paying the bill at 9h45 !"
Great tapas... great bar!
we stumbled on this great place it had great food great service great wine great ambiance the waiters were amazing if you go to malaga highly recommend going and sitting and enjoying we did on several occassions took abit of finding the next time but everyone knows it..........so just ask
"We had a great time there.....sipping some fino, eating some olives and bread."
I would recommend this place to everyone....a true classic in Malaga.
Several holidays in Javea and we love eating here.
Food is great and the service is always friendly and relaxed.
It is always popular but the service is excellent.
A must visit if eating out in Javea.
Recommend their Tapas at lunch time if you don't have time to visit the port area.
A quality restaurant without being too pricey.
lovely with my two small children as well.
Really good tapas place in Santiago.
Few seats but swift service.
If full - ask for seats.
They rotate tables quickly.
"Cordoba is full of generic Spanish tapas restaurants, many of which look like tourist joints, ensnaring unassuming Americans into their Venus fly traps of badly made paella and soggy patatas bravas."
"It was hence with an air of trepidation that we ventured into Restaurant La Sanaresa, even after having read good reviews on the place."
"We had no cause to be worried, however."
The service (you'll need to brush up on basic Spanish!)
"was friendly and quick; the starter of garlic soup (with poached egg and ham) was sublime; the main of garlic lamb stew was almost perfect (but too salty) and the desserts were pleasingly homemade, not off a laminated menu."
The bottle of Yllamas which we ordered was likewise amazing.
The meal was rounded off by complimentary local sweet wine in minature tankards.
"Rest assured, if you come here, you won't be part of the tourist conveyor belt."
Poncho's was a gem of a find.
"The steaks are out of this world, the service very good and the price very reasonable."
You would be hard pressed to find a better meal in Fuengirola.
Whilst in a fabulous position by the Minerva statue overlooking the bay of Tossa we had always been put off this restaurant because of the white plastic beach chairs and tables but on a hot June night we decided to give it a try.
Having ate well at lunch time we were only in the mood for one course and a dessert.
"The large tuna salad was excellent –substantial and with a variety of fresh leaves, tomato and olives and the other course, medallions of pork in pepper sauce was again well cooked and presented."
One shared dessert and a litre of house wine came to €31- good value but we do wish they could use tablecloths to make it moiré like a restaurant than a pavement beach
"We saw that the restaurant offered ""Meal of The Day"", a 3 course meal with bread and wine for 14 Euros."
Because the tables had a lovely view over the bay we thought we'd give it a try.
We really didn't think that the meal would be very good for such a cheap price.
"How wrong we were, the avacado prawn starter was plentiful and fresh, the peppered steak tasty and there was a great choice of desserts."
We had a whole bottle of reasonable dry white wine and plenty of bread.
"The service was good, the waiters pleasant and friendly."
Needless to say we returned every night during our holiday.
The menu was different every night.
The restaurant does not have a website and the waiter had nwver heard of trip advisor.
I enlightened him and hope he reads this review.
"This restaurant does deserve the custom, it was busy every night."
This restaurant is located in the Plaza Santa Anna.
"They serve tapas, and it is really delicious."
the tapasmenu is good and the tapas is a mixture from classicl dishes to more trendy tapas.
"They also have huge, cold Sangria here..."
"I recommend to get there around 8 og 8.30 as the outdoor place will fill up quickly, and there will be a que waiting for tables at this hot spo"
Really good food and great value for money.
Tapas are great.
Taberna is overcrowded so remember about makin reservation.
We had rather a long wait for our meal as it is a very busy restaurant but the food was good when it arrived
"This is an authentic bar, that serves real Spanish food."
"The quality is ok, but for those who are not so familiar with Spanish food, you must know that they use a lot of olive oil - a lot."
This makes these dishes somethimes very hard to digest.
"But the dishes are tasty, the services comes with a smile and the prices are very friendly."
A real Spanish adress.
I was recommended to try this place from a friend and had a vague address for it.
If trying to find for the first time it's useful to know it is on the corner of Plaza del Cristo de Burgos as advertised but on the far corner of Calle Dormitorio if heading from Barrio de Santa Cruz district.
I visited on a Sunday evening in July and the kitchen opens at 8pm (or 8.30) which was perfect timing as I was around 20 minutes early and so sat on the terrace with a lovely cold beer for the wait.
"Soon after the kitchen open the eight or so tables were full, and other groups had to put their name on a board to wait for an outside seat .. they mostly waited inside, while some wandered off."
"The menu is only in Spanish and some of the dishes aren't the usual tapas fare, makes it more fun, but the prices give you an idea and I was pleasantly surprised at the portion sizes."
Until the bill arrived I believed I must have had some media racione size dishes rather than the tapas.
"They weren't the best tapas I had, but a interesting selection and at a good price."
The other tables were a mix of Spanish speaking and tourists and as the waiting list quickly grew with local families arriving I felt I ought to let others take my prime terrace spot!
"I recommend to get there early after a hard days walk for a snack rather than main meal and know a few menu items before ordering, or take a risk and find something new you'll like."
This tapas bar was recomended by my hotel staff and it was a great surprise.
It is a very typical taberna where you can eat with the locals.
The food is very good and the service is fast.
Go for it!
The closest thing to China you could get in Madrid.
You can't find many better placed restaurants.
Just on the seafront 5 mins outside Palma.
"Excellent location, great food at very good prices and a service that wraps it all up in a very memorable package."
We sought out Bar Estrella due to the glowing reviews in Fodor's.
"What we found was mediocre food, an unbelievably rude waiter and tables on a dusty narrow sidestreet beside walls covered in graffiti."
It really wasn't worth the visit.
REally good Falafel on Las Ramblas.
This tiny place has great fillings.
It's perfect for an afternoon snack.
The best and truly genuine Pizza in Barcelona... and that could embarrass quite a few pizza place in Italy.
We found this place by accident looking in the In&Chic guide of places in Spain.
We were booked to go somewhere else but saw the picture of a great steak and we were sold - easy aren’t we!?
The place did not disappoint.
"We were 5 guys and decided upon the shared steak option, which were served in good time with excellent wine."
I've spent some time in Argentina where the steaks are off the radar.
Bolixe truly provided an authentic Argentinean steak at a very reasonable price.
It made the Gauco Grill chain look like McDonalds!
"The service was very good and the owner came to speak to us, giving more than good advice on where to go out afterwards."
The restaurant was full of locals apart from ourselves – always a good sign!
"There was an intimate ambience, which was not overdone."
We were very happy there as a group of guys although there were families and couples enjoying their evening.
"I would definitely go there again whether it be with guys, family or my partner."
I recently returned from Palma with a few friends.
I was lucky enough to stumble across this restaurant in a local guide.
I am so happy that we did.
It was a memorable experience.
This restaurant is very popular with locals and not really known or frequented by tourists.
The owner Leo was incredibly hospitable but what was nice was that he stopped us twice from over ordering and even suggested the best way to bring our meats so that they didn't get cold!
What followed was nothing short of delicious.
This is heaven for meat lovers.
The chuleta for 2 people was served perfectly cut and the accompaniments were all great as well.
We were then showered with chupitos and coffee etc.
I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.
Leo is a great host and it's also terrific value for money.
I will certainly visit again !
"We recently spent a week in a villa in the tiny village of Torret, close to Sant Lluis in Minorca."
"On the first day we noticed a sign pointing down a narrow lane in the village and, since it was just a pleasant stroll away from the villa, we thought we'd wander down there for dinner."
"On arrival, when we asked for a table we were asked in return if we had booked."
As we'd only just arrived we hadn't.
"'No problem' we were told, 'have a seat and order some drinks'."
"While we were sitting on the little sofas in the beautiful garden, we saw a guy exit the restaurant and walk past us with a smile."
"A minute later he returned, carrying a table over his shoulder."
We realised that the table was for us!
A few minutes later we were invited into the restaurant to find a beautifully laid table in a secluded corner.
From there things got better and better.
The food was divine - we ordered the 'set' menu and it was one of the best meals we have ever eaten anywhere.
A nice surprise before the starter was a selection of small appetizers - all of which were delicious.
The fish cakes we had to start were lovely and the sea bream with risotto main course was simply stunning.
"The service was unbelievably friendly (fluent Spanish, English and French is spoken by Noelia (front of house))."
"She recommended a fantastic bottle of Spanish wine, similar to a Sancerre but half the price."
We loved it so much that we booked to eat there again on our last night and when we arrived we were greeted like old friends.
This time the tables in the garden were set and we ate under a tree and had another sublime experience.
"Different set menu but again fantastic, finished with the best Chocolate Fondant I have ever eaten."
"We ate out all but one night we were in Minorca and this was by far the best place we ate for food, wine, service and general ambience."
Pan y Vino is very tucked away and unless you made the effort to find Torret you would never just happen to be passing.
"It is well worth seeking out, but we would recommend a reservation to be on the safe side."
"Patrick and Noelia deserve this place to be a resounding success for its relaxed, friendly atmosphere and the clever and beautifully balanced food."
Can't wait to go back.
Excellent meal last week with 6 foodies at Gresca.
The food was modern and experimental - most of the time the unusual combinations worked fabulously.
"The tasting menu worked exceptionally well, as is typical it must be ordered for the table at Gresca it must be ordered in advance."
They accomodated one in our party who does not eat pork by substituting around 50% of the dishes with elegant alternatives.
"The staff were friendly and very knowledgable, the wine list of good quality."
One of the best restaurants we found in Barcelona (personally I narrowly prefered Hisop but would heartily recommend both!)
love this place - it is great to just hang out here with friends or that special someone.
"Share some appetizers, have some drinks and just relax!!"
!
"I have to be honest, I didn't eat at the restaurant but rather enjoyed some tapas and cocktails upstairs at their roof top bar 'Panorama.'"
There was a good selection of tapas however very expensive.
"The hommus/aubergine dip came in, as the cheapest tapa, at €5 while the chicken skewers were €8, the 'patatas bravas' (potato wedges) €6, and the meatballs (only 4, very small) at €7."
"I won't hold against them the fact that they got my order wrong as although pricey, it was all very tasty!"
"The service was impeccable, some of the best I've experienced, but maybe that's because I'm used to the non-existent customer service in Paris."
"No to be fair, each waiter was very attentive and friendly."
"The cocktails were wonderful however at €12 a pop, it was a bit cheeky!"
"However you're essentially paying for the setting and view: the gorgeous sunset over Talamanca Beach, as well as the comfy white and red lounges and beds that allow you to cosy up to your company."
"It was chic but not pretentious, no one made you feel like you didn't belong, and it didn't matter if you were dressed casually or to the nines as there was all that and in between and still a nice ambiance."
"The music (chillout lounge, Ibiza style of course!)"
was great too.
"Stayed here for one night recently with husband, 15 year old daughter and her friend."
"Hotel is on the fringe of Finestrat, about 10 mins from Benidorm."
"Lovely outlook, surrounded by palm trees up in the mountains."
"Rooms are much larger than average, and decorated individually."
Tea & coffee making facilities and small fridge.
Extra large bathroom.
Had an evening meal there which was the best meal I've ever had in the Benidorm area.
"Approx 35 euros a head which included 2 bottles of wine, three courses and liquer coffees."
Definitely a place for special occasions.
Hotel seems to specialise in weddings and special occasions due to it's location.
"If there is a better restaurant in the world than Arzak in San Sebastian, Spain, please let us know at sundialcom@aol.com."
Simple and elegant decor.
Outstanding service.
Tasting menu to die for.
Best seafood course ever.
WOW!!!
"Stay at the Hotel Villa Soro, which is a fifteen minute walk away."
"Had a wonderful lunch here - 2 salmon fillets with Soller orange sauce and veg, husband had fish fillets on a bed of fried onions cooked in a light but tasty batter."
"Service, food and location were all excellent - it was average price but good value."
Would definately go back.
"Enjoyed sitting outside in the sun with a burger and a plate of calamari, chips and salad."
Good size portions and reasonable prices.
"Not much atmosphere of charm, but very busy with spanish people - singles, professionals, families just up from the beach etc."
grabbing a bite at lunchtime.
Been to the Miramar twice in the last two years.
Both visits pleasant.
"Gorgeous views from the balcony eating area especially early evening, although the wasps tend to gather at times."
"Waitor service okay, whilst the welcome was very good."
"Although relatively close to tourist areas of Mojacar et al, the restaurant has a good mixture of locals plus many British expats (a good sign)."
I had the lamb 'feast' on both visits and ordered salds also.
The lamb was excellent on both occasions and plenty enough to feed two adults and at least one greedy child!!
Served with our lamb we chose 'poor mans potatoes' which were an exellent accompaniment.
"The sweet was a bit disappointing though, but overall the meals were very nice."
We are returning to Almeria in a week or two and hope to visit the Miramar once again.
Hopefully the bush fires that were around the Bedar area hasn't affected this exellent value restaurant.
"Darren - Doddington, Cambs"
Enjoyed two meals at Los Vikingos during our stay in Sitges....the choice of food is excellent and the presentation very smart.
The staff were very freindly and willing to help out with the areas of Spanish where we struggled having only reached a basic Spanish level at the moment - service however was a little rushed !
i have been to several tragaluz restaurants and the one thing that is constant throughout is excellent decor with decent food and service.
"i like the style in this restaurant off the open storage on shelves which is done quite well ,the food is a mix off med /asian dishes ."
it is not on the cheap side but it is worth a visit.
"For the location, place and original proposition."
Great location in the marrket with a wonderful design.
"Portions are small, and the place really lacks value compared to some others."
Our service was erratic.
"Meals were brought out erractically, and our young waiter seemed put out by the smallest request."
Try the melon soup.
Another restaurant where my wife and I dined 2x.
"Portions are large and are made for sharing, and display the spirit of the Mercat Santa Caterina."
"Wide range of food in different styles, but clearly edited through a Spanish perspective."
Nice service and good value.
"The restaurant Cabo de la Nao is located in the La Nao Cape, on top of a spectacular cliff, so if your table is on the edge you will have spectacular views, however this is a tipycal restaurant to go at night, so when everything is dark, views are not so important."
"Food is quite good, well rice is good (specially arroz caldoso con calamares y gambas) so go for it."
"The rest of things in the menu are not spectacular, so you must go there only if everybody wants rice."
"It is a little bit pricy so be careful with wine and desserts (nothing special by the way, so its better going back to javea to have a nice ice cream in the arenal)."
"Service is correct, but not too friendly."
If you could eat the decor it would be lovely.
On so-called 'charming square Venerables' = a widening of the street with 99 outdoor tables.
Doubt if a true food lover or anyone Spanish has been there in 19 years.
About 60 tables inside -- last night 2 occupied.
Paella mediocre - gazpacho good - melon fair.
EU67 for 2.
Avoid.
Next door a real Sevillian place -- Cafe Roman 1.
A bride was there with attendants!
Good jamon serrano = EU11/ media razion.
Try it.
We ate at Forn on Friday evening-the 4th visit for the 6 of us in 4 years.
"We would agree that sometimes in the past the restaurant has been so-so, but on Friday the food was lovely, the atmosphere was as good as ever, and the service was EXCELLENT."
The waiters were very attentive and we asked for their recommendations for wine- the bottles were well chosen and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
"A big bonus of being in Forn on Friday night is that its straight across the way from the beautiful petals falling at Abaco at 11.30 which was a wonderful finale to a wonderful evening: pericey though-the bill was approx £150 per couple-in the past it has been £100 per couple, but blame the exchange rate."
Alison and Ken
"We have been to Forn twice, once during April 2008 & then this year in March."
Both times we have been impressed with the food and the service.
"On the first visit we were seated in a private area upstairs and had a fabulous waiter, he helped us with recommendations from the menu and made sure that we had everything we needed."
He advised us how much to order as I think we would have ordered way too much as everything sounded so tasty!!
On the second visit we were in a more lively area of the restaurant.
Again our waiter was very helpful with sugestions from the menu.
"The best dish by far was the foie, have never tasted anything like it, like butter it just melted in our mouths."
Cocktails and drinks weren't as expensive as other placed in Palma.
Would highly urge anyone visiting Palma to go to this restaurant.
AMAZING!!
!
"The decor is amazing, even the bathroom is really beautiful!"
"Great food, great drinks (the Mojito is incredible), great service, very beautiful people!"
A must go!
Overrated... overpriced!
"Superbe meat... they don't ask you how you want it cooked, they know how it is supposed to be served!"
Delightfull!
"Good atmosphere, we liked the baked fish, the muscles in wine, the beef loin."
This restaurant is now situated on the marina ....lovely setting with views over the harbour and Sea.
We were a party of 9....young adults (just finished GCSE's and A levels) and a couple (or 3) of older adults!
What a fabulous meal....we went a little 'off menu' to start asking for two plates of chiperones to share and then followed with starters in a simliar way in ordering a selection between us.
Everyone thrilled to share with highlights being the carpaccio of prawns and the octopus.
"Main courses were met with equal delight, enthusiasm and enjoyment."
A particular plus were the desserts as they had diabetic and gluten free options which was an added bonus with 2 coeliacs and a sugar free as members of our party.
The setting and the meal were fab...agreed the service could have been a little more attentive but the waiters were cheery and helpful.
All in all a great meal that met young and not so young expectations.
"La Maja was a big surprise for us, walking along the front in Altea, most restaurants provide serviceable speedy service with reasonable food, plastic table cloths, awnings and umbrellas advertising brands of beer etc, then there was La Maja."
"The awnings were plain, the tables were beautifully laid with linen table cloths, flowers, candles etc."
"We actually thought they might be preparing for a wedding reception the look was so different, they had just opened and - no, this is just how they are."
"So we dined there, under the awning on a beautiful summer's evening overlooking the sea, the food was superb."
"Since then, we have been back many times, we love it equally in summer and winter when it is cosy and atmospheric."
"Of note are their tapas starters, the sea bass with ""savage"" rice, and their salmon lasagne, but we've never been disappointed in anything we have had."
"Would thoroughly recommend, and look forward to our next visit."
"We thought that this would be a nice place to while away a Sunday afternoon, however the experience was over shadowed by average food costing € 140 for 2 people."
"(2 starters, 2 main courses, 1 desert, half bottle of Cava, 1 bottle of red)."
"I am quite sure that there are plenty of other establishments in Barcelona where your money, and your time, would be better spent."
The service was fine and we liked the interior décor and ambiance.
I think that the majority of the other reviews are spot on.
"It’s a pity because this restaurant could be, and should have been, a lovely experience."
The paella is definitely delicious... but service is so bad and prices not fair that you better look for another place to have paella...
It is a pity that this well known restaurant which serves yummy paella is unable to deliver good service and be more customer oriented.
Unfortunately I left the place with a clear impression that I was just caught in a touristic trap... and irritated by the inexperience with the staff working in such a traditional restaurant.
"If going to Barceloneta area for paella, head to Can Manel and enjoy!"
Perfect in every way for lovely evening.
Close to Harbour and Beach.
Reccomended by the hotel we stayed at and popular with the locals.
It delivered the goods!
"As noted in many other reviews, this is just for tourist."
"Ambiance was nice, our service was excellent but food was awful."
Definitely over priced for what you are served.
The best value was the wine.
I had my wedding reception here and it was the best ever!
"I couldn't thank the owners & staff more for their hospitality, help and thoughtfulness."
"We had a fantastic setting, the tapas menu we selected was outstanding, my guests couldn't believe how much food there was!"
The cake they organised was amazing!
"We couldn't have asked for a better wedding reception, despite the fact that they usually don't cater for weddings!"
Thank you so much for it.
The Irish gang!
!
This restaurant may have been renovated and changed its name since the previous reviews.
I knew it by Divinus in early June 2009.
"After spending three weeks in Languodoc and southern Spain before returning to Barcelona for two nights, the three meals I had at this place were the best of my entire trip."
"Interesting, inventive menu, well-prepared."
I loved the Catalunian flavour.
Service was very pleasant and atmosphere was comfortable.
I would have gone back every day had I stayed longer.
"after recommendation from a spanish hotel attendant, i went there with my girlfriend and we had a great meal with lots of food and wine for a cheap price (30€ for one 3-piece menu with wine + torrada + sangria)!"
the torrada with grilled brie looked amazing and was actually very tasty!
"the only drawback was that our waiter, who knew that we were not fluent in spanish, tried to confuse us by skipping the main piece of the menu!"
fortunately this didn't happen in the end!
;-)
"We ate here in late june, 2009 having been in March of 2008 as well."
"The food is quite good,especially the lamb chops, the wild boar, the beans with jamon, and the dates wrapped in jamon!"
"The fish was over cooked, though this is something I've come to expect in Spain."
"Entree's were about 12 euros, the wine list is long and extensive, the waitstaff are really friendly and generous."
All good!
I don't know where the other 2 reviewers went but it wasn't the same place as me!
The menu is huge (raised doubts straight away...how could they cook all that to order?)
with typical dishes and some odd combinations.
I order chicken stuffed with sun dried tomato..and apart from not finding any tomato the chicken was extremely dry...infact O couldn't eat it.
Other round the table seemed to have the same concoction no matter what they'd ordered.
Interestingly we were sat at a table by the kitchen and I could hear no noise!
No chef chatter...no clanging pans...it was very quiet.
Perhaps the food was pre-cooked and stuck in a microwave hence the dryness?
"Decor is like a 'Raiders from the Lost Arc', if you like that sort of thing, and its fun to ring up people on tables via the phones...so good for flirting anonymously."
But is you want good mexican food...stay away!
"Wonderful find, on the road opposite station down to sea."
Amazing lunch menu at 9e.50 - huge choice plus daily specials.
Three courses including wine/beer and bread.
"Friendly welcome, the food was amazing, morcilla, gigantes or fiduela with seafood, fresh sea bream, bacalao, the list went on and on."
Our three-year-old granddaughter was treated like royalty!
I knew we had picked a winner when three members of the local police walked in for their lunch.
"Don't miss this place, it's brilliant."
"Rincon D’Aragon If you go to Barcelona and is looking for some really good food, you cannot miss going to the restaurant ‘Rincon d’Aragon’."
I got the impression that it’s a family ran restaurant.
It has delicious and genuine food.
The waitress was also very helpful and cheerful.
"Even though she could not speak English, she did her best to help us chose the right plate and make us feel comfortable."
It is not the cheapest restaurant we have been to in Barcelona but it was definitely the finest one.
"We were two persons and both had starters, main plate, dessert, coffee and wine and the price came up to €80."
The restaurant is placed in ‘Carrer del Carme’ street.
Yes... a pleasant place.
"Lovely homemade genuine Italian Food, A must visit in Playa Blanca!"
The best value restaurant in Madrid - it's actually cheaper to come and eat here than get a Burger King!
"The food is tasty and arrives quickly, only negative is that some the staff are quite abrupt/rude."
We ate here twice during our holiday and would go back.
Pricey and overrated.. good quality of service.
"I returned to this restaurant last night - having been there several times & also to their sister restaurants - Gloria de Montera, Public, La Finca de Susana, Bazaar - I have always thought the decoration & ambience in the restaurants very good and the food not bad for the price."
Last night we were seated downstairs in the smoking area - just beside the entrance where the waiters gather bits & pieces before serving the table.
"After ordering our food, we saw one of the waiters drop a croqueta on the floor right in front of us and then return it to the plate and serve it to the customer."
The people at the table next to us - saw this also & we equally shocked.
Next we saw the communal basket of bread being knocked over by the same waiter - who picked up all the bread and returned it to the basket for serving to customers.
His colleague saw both of these things happening & she didnt say anything either.
So I asked for the supervisor and explained what happened.
He spoke to the waiters who said the food that fell from the plate to the floor was returned to the kitchen & a new one served to the customer - this was not true.
They said that it was not the bread basket but the linen basket that fell to the floor!
more lies!
When I suggested that we see then if there are any hairs or dust on the bread - the bread basket disappeared very quickly.
The supervisor was not very apologetic and seemed to support his staff that were telling stories more than wanting to hear my complaints - he offered little apology and didnt suggest anything that he was going to do to improve matters.
"I asked for a ""Hoja de Reclamacion"" (Complaints Form) & spent the rest of the meal completing that - I will not be returning again as the standards of hygiene & disregard for customers is astonishing!"
This is really a nice place with good food for very reasonable prices.
The place looks like a deluxe restaurant.
Prepare for and ignore the rushy and unfriendly service and you will have an enjoyable dinner here.
After reading the reviews we booked a table for the 2nd night of our holiday.
"The decor is plain and obviously very Spanish, which seemed to indicate that the food also be something to savour."
I ordered baby squid and my wife mussels with herbs as our starters.
"The squid seemed particularly pricey at 11 euros, but when they arrived the portion was relatively small, they were deep fried and just sitting on a bed of shredded red cabbage."
My wife's 5 mussels were also nothing to shout about in either quantity or quality.
Our shared paella arrived in good time along with 2 large prwns and 4 mussels in the shell.
However the shell of the mussels was so burnt that they were disintegrating in to the food and the mussels were shrivelled.
I mentioned thais to the owner who explained that the finishing off in the oven was the problem.
I always thought paella was cooked on the top of the stove not in the oven.
He was very dismissive.
The staff seemed to be snarling at each other as the evening progressed.
There was very little ambience and the wines were very expensive at 20euros+.
"We left without a dessert or coffee, but still having spent 75euros !"
"Later in the week we ate at Il Giardio in the main square which was excellent and whilst of a comparable cost the quality of the food, service and ambience was so much better than the Clivia that we thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Perhaps we hit a bad night at the Clivia, but I think they were out to charge as much as possible without giving any thought to quality etc."
It was Sunday and we were limited to available dinner options as many restaurants are closed on Sunday.
Upon arriving at Can Ramonet--I had a bad feeling about it.
The place was full of sun-burnt tourists and not a local in sight.
The place is famed for their paella and fresh seafood and we proceeded to order just that.
Langostinas a la plancha for 26 euros were serviceable but nothing special.
Cava sangria was sugary and barely drinkable.
The order of sea snails was fresh.
The paella marinera was a soup/gruel of barely distinguishable seafood with gummy rice and copious amounts of salt as it's only flavor component.
We felt like major suckers after getting the bill of 296 euros for what amounted to a 'meal' of incredibly mediocre food.
Simple and popular.. yet enjoyed it every time I went there for chorizo y pollo!
"Last time I was in Barcelona I went for dinner to IL Giardinetto, a restaurant of the Group 7 Portes, which are locally known for their excepcional food service."
"IL Giardinetto brings you into a unique atmosphere, which reminds you of the old days, the great service and attention."
"The food is fantastic, and while you'll be enjoyin your dinner you will be able to listen the Piano."
I trully recomend this restaurant for anyone who can afford it.
"Even though the prices are high, it's worth it every penny."
Situated in typical old Orotava building with patio - the restaraunt itself is tourist attraction.
"Specialises in local food: cheese, fresh fish, meats, potatos..."
Try Rancho Canario village soup.
"Reasonably priced, good service, menu in English, German..."
What a surprise to visit this restaurant in the old town of Calpe.
It was a test because we know the quality of the second of the top of tripadvisor website (puerto blanco).
"What a surprise, fine cooking, very good smell, and fresh products."
"With a atmosphere so...british (for us frenchies) Yes, taste it it's a very good idea."
"And to find location, find a little street called ""Carreer Dos del Maig"", it's just near City hall."
"WOW, we read about this restaurant on Zagat.com and it did not disappoint."
We were the only tourists in there.
"It is small, understated, and the food and service is AWESOME."
Well worth every penny.
"Try their steak, it was fabulous."
"We stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights, had dinner at Cafe de L'Opera on the first night and came back on the last because it was the best."
"Excellent tapas - we had a mixed meat, mixed cheese and mixed olive plates along with Cava Sangria that knocked us off our feet."
The service is reserved and unobtrusive.
"The location can't be beat - go inside for a more romantic dinner, or eat out on La Rambla for the best people watching."
Arrive early (before 7) to be sure of a table - later people take the spots and just nurse their drinks for hours while watching the world go by.
Just got back from a week in Lanzarote.
Visited this restaurant twice with my wife and two teenage daughters.
The first time we chose Tapas entirely from their Tapas menu.
My daughters were a bit apprehensive about the native foods.
The waiters suggested we order a few dishes to begin with and then order some more afterwards.
The food was excellent and we were all pleased.
Service was also pretty good as well and the waiters very helpful and friendly.
"We enjoyed the experience so much that we return later in the week, but just had a main course each."
"My eldest daughter had a sirloin at 9 Euros which was excellent, whilst the rest oof us had the mixed meat kebab which was also excellent at a similar price."
Worth a visit.
"We ate here twice during a week long stay recently, excellent sirloin steak for 9 euro, drinks resonable."
I had a massive T bone on our final night !
", really good service and well worth a visit."
Very tasty food but smallish portions and slow service but would still recommend it.
"Went to Haveli for a meal last week,all I can say reading all the other reviews is the chef must have been having an off night.Worst Indian meal I have ever had,bland and totally tasteless,mine was supposed to be hot as in spicy I could have quite easily have given it to my 2 year old to eat it was so mild.Will be trying another Indian next visit."
I guess everyone who traveled Barcelona know Catalans can be quite stiff and arrogant... As i found myself on few occasions especially when it comes to local restaurants.
"Well, after a not-so-brilliant day, i found myself in CASA DELFIN restaurant, were my day was saved by a very professional and kind waiter and a brilliant local cuisine and wine."
"I strongly recommend the apple tart with vanilla ice cream (the best i had in my life, and i have being in some restaurants for now) ""Pastis de poma caramelizada amb gelat de vanilla"" and the stowed Turbot ""Turbot al forn amb verdureta i bolets""... Not to mention the assorted clams in white wine."
"Anyway, long story short: great food, very good waiter recommendation (especially on the wine) good price."
"I felt like watched over by God (next to the door was a Catalan placard ""DIEU VOS GARDE"")"
"We had arrived at Hotel Altair and knew this place was around the corner so we headed here for lunch.The menu is available in all languages but we had fun figuring out the galician version............. My gluten free allergy prevented me from tasting 1/2 the menu,but no worries we were here for the seafood."
Boquerones first (white anchovies) a fav of ours.
The polpo feria octopus steamed and broiled served in a terracota dish.
"We were sitting outside so we could here the conversations of the people passing by"" Polpo"" seems to be a fav of everybody around here and many people sat at the empty seats after viewing our polpo !"
There lips smacking at the thought of tasting this delicate dish.I remember Mario Batali raving about polpo on the show Spain On the Road Again.
Which by coincidence was just about to be shown in Spain the same day.
We then had a simple salad of shrimp and elvers(small eels)so good and a small salad of local cheese with walnuts.
"As part of our grand Gaudi tour of Barcelona, Los Caracoles provided the culinary history link."
We were aware of the legendary stories about this Barcelona institution and were not disappointed.
"Upon entering the restaurant you step back into the past and enjoy the snail motif on everything from the furniture to the bread served by the efficient but sometimes a little snooty waiting staff who really are quite keen for a tip, to the tiles in the amazing bathrooms."
"The food varies from great for the snails, chicken (which can be seen roasting at the front of the restaurant) and roast pork to OK for the rather dark paella."
The wine list is fine with many local delights and a few imported gems.
"Two musts for this experience are a visit to the room off the main dining area with the hams dangling, suspended from the roof and walking up to the kitchen area to enjoy the spectacle of the busy kitchen in full flight."
Feel free - as I did - to photograph them at work.
We went here in July 09 on recomendation it was our wedding anniversary.
It was a buzzing atmosphere and obviously very popular.
The food was great and the service good too.
The paella is amazing.
The chicken is cooked on the rotisserie so really tasty.
Would recommend reserving a table to avoid disappointment.
I have been here before and always recommended this restaurant.
Last week went back with friends and the service was horrible and very dissapointing.
"We had to wait for drinks 0,5 hour every time we ordered something."
"They forgot our orders, did not even ask how the food was, there was no airco inside.and there were not that many guests inside...For the amount of money you pay you would at least expect an excellent service..."
I went to this restaurant with my Art History professor to celebrate the end of our Mexican Art History class.
"The food was good - there is a wonderful selection, from mole to different types of tacos as well as nopal salad...it is great place for an introduction to Mexican food in Madrid."
"Oooh, the decore is out of this world...cheesy, but so fun!!"
!
I went to this place often because I lived & went to school nearby.
"The pizza is okay - some of it a little on the creative side with a banana topping...on the whole, not bad, but if I didn't live around the corner I may not have gone there a whole lot."
The service is better than most in Spain however and the large glass windows are very pleasant!
"Based on the tripadvisor reviews, we decided to try this tapas place the night after we landed and we loved the food, value and location of this restaurant."
We've been in Marbella 4 days and had dinner here two nights.
We plan to go back once more before we leave.
The waiters walk around with platters of tapas and describe them to each table so that you know what you will be trying.
They tally the bill at the end based on number of skewers used for each tapas that you consume to determine the total (eg 4 tapas skewers x approx between 1.15 and 2euros each depending on the type of tapas you picked).
We ate all the tapas we liked and ordered two entrees and a salad plus two bottles of rioja and the bill was 68euros for three people (approx 10 euro for house rioja).
We went to puerto banus the night before and had a mediocre appetizer plus a mediocre entree for 90 euros for three people.
The first night in Marbella we were strolling around old Marbella (near Plaza Naranjas) and paid 84 euro for a tolerable and undistinguished meal (including a beer and a liter of sangria).
The tapas were delicious and most of them were different from our first night there.
I especially liked the ham wrapped fried asaragus.
"If the chicken skewers make it to your table, make sure to snap them up!"
DELICIOUS.
We also really like the spinach salad with cheese and the chicken with mushroom entree.
"Simple, but good."
The servers are extremely fair in their rotations.
They have plates filled with one dish.
They will walk around with the dish until they are empty and then head back to the kitchen.
"When he comes back, he will usually start at the the next table in line making frequent rotations around the restaurant in that order."
"When it is time to tally the bill, the waiter will count the number of skewers in front of you before she brings the bill."
The restaurant is on a busy street and is extremely easy to find.
They have outdoor seating which is fantastic to enjoy the cool night weather.
My ONLY quibble with sitting outdoors are the throngs of street peddlers trying to sell their wares.
They were easy to ignore if you did not acknowledge their merchandise but it was a nuisance all the same.
"Other then that, we loved this place and we highly recommend for a affordable, good eat."
"A great place with the finest, just THE Finest Jamon in the world - Friendly service with option of table or bar."
The table has a selection of worryingly vintage sweets beneath a glass top - You have to give a good review just for that!
We just got back from a two week stay and after a disappointing dining experience in Fornells we discovered El Pirata while visiting the local supermarket.
From the moment we looked at the outside menu the staff made us feel more than welcome and within minutes of sitting down Tony was already charming us with his friendly humour!
The food was excellent and very reasonably priced.
During our stay we sampled most of the menu and did not find one meal that was not to our satisfaction or disappointment.
The fish was so good one of us ate a whole salmon!
The Sangria was the best on the island!
They cater for every age group even having the karaoke based game Singstar available for all the children and a few of us grown ups!
"Be it breakfast lunch or dinner El Pirata always delivered a delightful dining experience, it made our holiday!"
"You didn't just have to stick to what was on the menu, if there was anything definitely you wanted change it was, in the words of Tony 'no problem'."
We will be visiting the restaurant when we stay hopefully next year!
"Big thanks to Tony, his wife and the rest of El Pirata!"
Muy bien!
!
"When my friend recommended this place to me he said the food was fantastic, service very quick and friendly and that it was reasonably priced."
"I took it with a pinch of salt as he's rarely correct :D.  However, yes, he was right!"
"Good varied menu, great quality food, nice friendly staff, not the cheapest Thai in Madrid, but the price to quality ratio is excellent."
I have myself recommended the resturant to other friends and taken countless others down there and everyone has enjoyed it.
Check it out.
"Personally, I can't fault the place."
"The place is fantastic .. very nice people, they remember you after months of not going there ... and may even invite you to a 'chupito' of licour :) The noodles, the rice with vegetables, shrimps, and the green curry chicken are awesome .. and they are cheap !!"
But do not ask for wine .. it's not really nice :(
i found this place by chance and the first thing I noticed loads of Roys cars and had me wondering.
"I tried the Indian Curry and Pizza, I was surprised how good the meal was, also the the waitress was English and she was good and made us feel at home."
Got my vote!!
!
"How can you not love the amazing, incredible food that is served over here?"
"We took the entire 'feast menu' including the very well matching wines (mainly from Spain, of course) and were taken from one sensation to the other."
One thing is puzzling us though: how can the service be so impeccable at the beginning of the evening and - during the course of the evening - go worse and worse?
"Water was refilled timely, our serviettes were replaced whenever we left the table for a few minutes (nice smoking lounge by the way) and the servants would immediately notice when you were looking for the toilettes."
"The last third of the evening though, service became completely sloppy."
"No more water refills, serviettes still on the table, wine not timely served, etc."
"It's all a matter of expectation: if you start with marvelous service, the disappointment is bigger if it then becomes bad."
"Eventually, we had to wait long for our bill: we had to ask twice before getting it."
"So this is a mixed experience: great, innovative yet pure food - one of the best dinners we ever had - and service that was great first but then became sloppy and eventually almost a dissatisfier."
It's just a matter of staying sharp all evening and this beautiful restaurant will easily stay at the top/.
El Trull in Sitges is definitely not one of the common beach bars in Sitges.
It is more of a city restaurant from any big city.
"The place is cosy, the staff is nice, quick and knowledgeable."
The first courses we had were goat cheese on a sallad and French onion soup.
"Both were good, even if there really was too much sallad aroound the toast with the cheese."
"So, why go there?"
It is all about the Steak Tartar.
They have a secret way of doing it and it is...
WONDERFUL!
Food was mediocre - service was poor and slow.
The owner spent a lot more time with the larger tables that entered the restaurant after ourselves.
We waited so long for service that eventually we decided to pay and leave without dessert or coffee.
Don Vito in the Port of Alcudia has been there for a number of years serving excellent Pizza.
"I would say the price has not gone up that much over the years, may be the size has been cut down a little, but the quality of the food is excellent, and I would say when in Alcudia do go and have a meal at Don Vito."
"The staff are friendly, the service is quite quick, it is clean, and you can sit and watch the world go by."
Enjoy.
Just incompetent staff... and chef!
Must have an incompetent owner.
Excellent basque tapas place.
hmm nice setting but nothing particular food-wise.
"Used to eat here often, but last September found the service had gone really down."
"The waiting time was unacceptable, had to chase for missed orders & cutlery and were not offered puddings."
"Won't be visting again,which is a pity as I used to enjoy the atmosphere."
We have been going to Santa Ponsa for over 25 years and Toni's pizza (real name Pacco and looks like one of the super mario brothers) is almost certainly the best value in Santa Ponsa.
The 3 course with drink included for under 10 euros is superb and will satify even those with a large appetite.
The menu changes daily but he is flexible and will change the menu if you ask.
If 2 of you order wine a full bottle will be opened at your table and left.
The calzone is fantastic and he will make it in any style of pizza on the menu (Inferno is marvellous).
Many locals eat here and this is probably the best indication of this resteraunts quality and value.
Give the wee man a try you won't be dissapointed.
P.s on our last night he left a bottle of scotch whiskey on our table as an after dinner drink.
The place to go with your Italian friends...
This restaurant is one of our favourites.
The staff are all friendly and welcoming and the food is superb.
"Lovely place to eat, especially on the terrace in Summer."
We would recomend the lamb or the steak especially.
Best to make a reservation as it is always busy.
Be sure to visit this lovely little Italian restaurant when dining in the El Born area.
"Real Southern Italian food, reasonable pricing and very friendly atmosphere, in one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Barcelona."
My wife and I ate here two nights in a row because we liked it so much!
"It is actually a pretty expensive place to eat unless you go for the ""special""."
It is a 3 course meal with your drink (beer or wine or water) included for only 16 Euros!
At the end of the meal they even bring our some grappa (very strong) and a flavored liquor (we had melon) with some sort of lemon cake.
This was after we already had desert!
I strongly recommend this restaurant!
A good tips is to go around 7 or 8...it gets really busy after 9.
We are just back from a 5 day break in Barca.
It is my 6th trip to the city so we have seen & ate in all the areas over the years.
I can safely say the 2 meals we had at La Barca was superb.
The seafood cocktail was to die for & the sirlion steak I had the 1stnight was one of the best ever.
The service on both nights was excellent & the waiters were very attentive.
"The 2nd night we had a ""PREPARED"" seafood pealla."
"The ""PREPARED"" part was that they had all the shellfish peeled for us & this saved time & getting clothes etc covered in sauce."
Again one of the best meals we have had in the city.
It is situated at Port Olympic on the ground floor by the marina.
ITS WORTH GIVING IT A TRY.
"We stayed in San An Bay in July and as regular visitors to Ibiza went to the usual haunts (Mambo, Il Vaticano, Villa Mercedes) but were really impressed with Bay Bar..."
"Polite staff, chilled atmosphere, beds and swings you can sit/lie on, good music, relatively cheap..... we went three times and loved it each time."
Pay it a visit...
"If you love chocolate you will enjoy visiting this place with so many creative varieties available -- chocolate in all its shapes and sizes You can purchase items to take with you, or eat in the restaurant at the back of the store."
"There is a good supply of the traditional milk and dark chocolate, as well as the adventorous chocolate you might be surprised to find -- with those unexpected ingredients you'd see featured on the Food Network."
"Everything I found here was expensive, but not ridiculosuly so -- a little something to splurge on while on vacation."
My wife and I stopped in on a hot summer day for cold chocolate drinks -- both were absolutely delicious -- creamy and rich are understatements -- the best chocolate I've ever had.
"I can only speak about the one waitress who served us on our one visit, but in the interest of being honest -- she was rude."
We heard her complaining about us -- loudly -- to her colleagues behind the bar for taking too long to decide what we wanted.
I'm not sure if she was just having a bad day.
"Anyway, you should go despite her if you love chocolate -- if you don't speak Spanish or Catalan, you won't be able to understand her anyway."
The place was awesome and made us want to open one in FL.
The server was really rude and couldn't care less but we were obsessed with the awesome flavors.
Visited this outstanding Vegetarian restaurant (with Vegan options) twice in July for dinner.
"We stayed at the Hotel Saray, just a short walk away, though a bit out of the main Granada downtown."
"If you have visited Spain before, you know how difficult it can be to find good vegetarian food."
Raices serves a variety of different vegetarian (and vegan) options including soy and seitan.
They have a Spanish and English menu.
Get both because the Spanish menu has the photos while the English menu has no photos descriptions in English (of course).
The menu is quite lengthy.
The food is extremely good and a good value.
Not top end (especially in presentation) but extremely tasty.
"We recommend the albondigas (""meatballs"") in the orange sauce (forgot the exact name)."
"The french onion soup with bread was heavenly, the asparagus soup just ok."
The quantity of food is generous.
The first time we got appetizers and then a main course - the second time we just got the main course.
The kids ate an outstanding chocolate covered ice cream filled crepe.
They have fresh cakes as well.
I would save room for desert.
"There is an extensive beverage selection including teas (not as easy to find in Spain), a small wine list, and lots of fruit drinks and smoothies."
We got one of the less expensive Riojo wines - it was quite reasonable.
They let us take the unfinished bottle with us.
Overall the food was quite good.
"Not complex, but filling, tasty, and a reasonable value."
"Locally known as Pork Chop Pepe's, the Siesta Grill is hidden within the Siesta Complex, but once you have found it, you will return time and time again."
"Value for money, freshly cooked, tasty, plenty of it."
"For one price you get pan and alioli, bowl of fresh salad (produce grown organically from Pepe and Rosa's land), your choice of meat or fish, and a jacket potatoe and grilled pepper."
"All cooked on an open bbq grill, you get perfect food every time."
"Pepe and Rosa have been at Siesta Grill for as long as I can remember, and would recommend you to go eat there."
"My husbands line to me while we are there.... ""what would you say if I told you that by tonight you'd be eating fish heads?"""
"To be honest, I was really unsure of eating deep fried Sardines, but to my pleasant surprise..."
I LOVED them!
And so does everyone there.
Best place to stand around and have an appetizer and some really cheap white and red wine for 1 Euro!
Try the bottles of wine there and test your skill as you try to pour the wine into your mouth... or miss your mouth... whatever happens ... you'll be having fun!
You will have read about this restaurant in all the guide books for Vitoria.
I used to love this place and look forward to several visits each year.
Since it was taken over by the new management the food and service are just not the same.
The setting is still outstanding and very romantic for that special event - the food is not that great for the price you pay.
Went for snack at night after large lunch with wife.
Madrid (and Spanish) dining hours were difficult - we liked to eat at 9:00 pm and the restaurants were usually empty.
"Wo when our hotel concierge sent us to Cervantes, we were happy to find great atmosphere, vibrant and good food- all at early hour."
"It seemed to crowded with locals, and the portions were generous."
Great value.
"We were tired, and it was close, but the food was good, and i loved the atmosphere."
"My daughter thought it creepy and said the chef was a ghost, but I guess dead people cook well."
We had the Osso Bucco and Conejo a la Parilla (grilled rabbit) and both were excellent.
"We arrived 5 minutes before closing, but the waiter remembered us from when we were reading the menu earlier that afternoon, and let us in and served us well."
He even remembered what we would order.
"May not be the best, and could be touristy, but if you're in the neighborhood, I would recommend."
Dinner for two with a croquet starter and wine was about 40 E.
"It's not cheap, esp with current exchange rates, but worth the spend as, once you have experienced Il Giardino, there is no contest elsewhere in Pollensa for food, service and the buzzing atmosphere of the main square."
"As a regular visitor to Pollensa, I've tried to find a match to no avail."
It's great for couples and families alike.
All dishes I have sampled are delicious and the kids' meals too are served with impressive attention to detail.
I recommend you eat here early on in your holiday as you will want to return.
Book at weekends.
We loved the food and the environment.
The service was excellent.
The employees are wonderful and love working there.
The food was delectable.
We went twice when we were staying in Marbella.
It is completely worth the drive.
"Besides, Benahavis is a beautiful little town to visit."
The concierge at the Parador told us this was by far the best restaurant in Hondarribia...and it was indeed a truly magical dining experience.
The staff was very friendly and attentive.
"The owner came back with a large book to show us the types of fish they had that day, the sommelier was right on with the wine."
We dined outside on the patio.
Don't miss it if you are in the area!
Expensive but definitely not overpriced.
We had lunch here twice when visiting Madrid in March.
"They do an excellent ""Menu del Dia"" for 10 euros including drinks, with 3-4 choices of starter and main course."
"If your drink choice is wine, they leave you the bottle!"
"Despite being on Calle Mayor this is not a tourist rip-off, and we were welcomed with open arms on our second visit."
Highly recommended!
"I discovered Conesa by chance, as I strolled by the Plaça de Sant Jaume."
"I didn't know where to eat nearby, so I ran into that little establishment with long lines."
It turned out to be a safe bet!
I ordered an entrepà català and couldn't regret less!
€ 3.50 for a giant freshly-made sandwich.
I liked it to much that went there again on my last day.
Strongly recommended!
"I didn't find a better option to eat fast, cheap and typically Catalonian food."
Just come back from a one week stay at Sol Timor apartments - found a great bar/restaurant left of the sol directly opposite the sol aloha next to brit bits supermarket.
The Fig and Olive is a family run bar/restaurant that in our opinion has the best food anywhere on the costa.
Excellent value for money and the food is delicious.
Homemade chips are great!
as is all the food we tried there.
Breakfast is by far the best on that strip and we have been to almost everywhere along Irish row.
The prices are great too with drink specials and 2 for 1 happy hour every day 7-8pm.
They had an Elvis impersonator there and a singer in the week we were there - both very good.
Even gave us free sandwiches the night Elvis played.
"Will be returning to the area in December - probably won't 'stay at Sol Timor will stay at the Aloha or Rui but will definitely be back to visit the Fig and Olive - oh, almost forgot to mention their toilets are spotless....."
"lovely service, with a smile."
"Good, fresh, home made food."
"Amazing Pizzas, Burgers and Pasta, oh and great coffee."
Basic but real quality food.
"I came here with my father for lunch, after hearing wonderful things about the seafood and shellfish."
"El Cucurucho del Mar is tucked away on one of the side streets of Madrid, but it was definitely bustling with people looking for a good meal."
"The restaurant features a 3 course menu of the day, which I made my selections from."
"Not only was it a great deal, but it was also delicious food (sometimes the menu of the day options can be hit or miss)."
"My waiter also brought me a bottle of wine, which was included with the special, and allowed me to take as many glasses as I wished…such a nice touch!"
"As a starter, I had the melon con jamon."
It was delightful.
"The melon was so sweet, like nectar and the jamon was fantastic as well."
We also sampled some of the empanadas to start; the pastry was flaky and the fish was very fresh.
My two options for the menu of the day were anchovies (which I despise!)
"and veal, so I opted for the veal."
"Fortunately, my father was nice enough to share some of his hake with me, which was absolutely delicious."
"For dessert, I opted for the fresh peach."
I do not exaggerate when I say this was the best peach I have ever eaten.
"In general, I found the produce in Spain to be incredible, but this peach was firm, juicy, and sweet."
"My father chose chestnuts with nata, which were also a delicious treat."
"Our service wasn’t the most attentive, but they were there when we needed them, which I appreciated."
"All in all, a very good and satisfying meal."
This restaurant was on the seafront and was one that had been reviewed on Tripadvisor and we also got a 10% off card from our rep so thought we would give it a try.
"The food was good, you had a small smoked salmon crudites to start (on the house) and the wine was nicely chilled."
The starters were both good - prawn cocktail (perhaps slightly too much sauce it drowned it a bit) and salmon (with loads of salmon).
We both had steak for our main which was good but fattier than you would expect.
Neither of us had dessert.
The service was ok but the staff appeared to just be going through the motions as opposed to being happy too be there.
"The bill for a beer, a bottle of wine, 2 starters and 2 mains courses came to not much under 100 euro."
"Overall, my experience at La Camarga was positive."
"The restaurant is, indeed, very elegant and classy."
The food was pretty good.
The decor was pleasant.
"They had a menu in English, which was a major plus for us."
"We had a nice, quiet weekday evening."
"However, we did not find anything spectacular about this restaurant."
"There was no ""WOW"" factor."
"So if you are used to dining in super-restaurants, you will be disappointed."
"If, however, you're looking for a solid meal among a nice crowd with good service - you'll like it at La Camarga."
We dropped into the Sirena Verde by chance after a hot night out in Madrid in midsummer.
"Without batting an eyelash, we were immediately welcomed at the bar downstairs by a smiling waitress and served the fresh and excellent Albarino wine from Galicia we requested."
"Perfect and plentiful salpicon (a mixture of white fish, prawns and crab, marinated in lemon juice, mixed with onions, tomatoes and peppers and dressed with olive oil), followed by grilled and surprisingly tender and delicate navajas (small razor clams) and good fried and very moreish chupitas (baby squid, known as chipirones in Barcleona) made the perfect meal."
Some freebies of fine jamon tapas and a digestif polished off the meal and us!
"We liked it so much we went back the next day for earthy arroz negro and chilli-spiked gambas al ajillo, with more salpicon, this time with freebies of a different tapa and a supposedly non-alcoholic and delicious apple digestif."
Definitely on the list for next time and worth a visit if in the area.
Went back to this restaurant in March after a long absence.
It's just as good now as it has always been.
The clientele consist mostly of locals and ex pats.
There were 4 of us on the night.
My three friends had never been there and were totally knocked out by the quality of both the food and the friendliness of the staff.
Between us we had both fish and meat dishes and several starters.
We also had a couple of bottles of wine and a few beers.
"I cant recall what the exact bill came to but, it was extremely good value for money."
I am told the do a great lunch deal here for around Euro 7.
Am going back to Torre in Sept and will update this review then.
Enjoy!!
PS.
Not to be confused with Nuevo Lanjeron next door which is'nt a patch on this place.
I think their was a split in the family and another brother opened up the new one
Nice modern restaurant.
Was heaving both nights we ate there.
Mainly locals ate there which was a good sign.
Excellent past and pizzas.
Highly recommended.
Staff a bit glum.
[--] smile and i will give you a tip!
"Been to this restaurant four times in four years, not the cheapest but the food has always been of the highest quality."
Probably about 50 euros for two including wine.
We have always been treated as if special and the atmosphere is superb.
"Tried both the Ostrich and Wild Boar, both very good."
You are entertained by the singing waiter or low key trio.
When booking (last time I had to book a week in advance) ask for a table on the patio.
You could be sat near to someone famous as they seem to gravitate here.
"The best thing about El Molino Blanco are it's beatifull gardens, we always opt to sit outside as when it gets dark the whole garden and outside area is lit up, very romantic."
"Good food, good service...."
Not good.
Chef should concentrate on improving the food and keeping prices down instead of singing to the restaurant.
"Very pretty place but they are resting on their past reputation and the food was not good, but about £50 per head - so well overpriced."
We went as a family of 4 and settled for the one located at Nunezde Arce 6 - less crowded.
The waiter recommended garlic chicken.
"calamari, spanish totilla.. all very good."
We would defintely go again if we drop by Madrid.
Sitting is a bit tight though but not obstructive.
Pricing moderate but very good value for money.
"Right off Plaza Santa Ana, pleasant atmosphere, great food, good service."
The best food I had in 10 days in Madrid (I had the trout).
It was recommended by two lovely ladies by Las Cibeles.
"It wasn't cheap but we had everything offered to us, including dessert."
Yum.
the best restaurant I have been in a long time...
"The food, atmosphere, service and of course that view to Alhambra- everything was perfect!"
thanks for your recommendations.
Me and my new wife (on our honeymoon) decided to eat here one night.
Make sure you make a reservation for the terraza or you will get stuck eating inside across the street and will miss the beauty that is granada.
"Not only is the view of Alhambra gorgeous, but the people around, the noise, the atmosphere, the musicians, all made the evening very romantic."
This place is a delicious blend of culinary delights.
Try the melon soup and the cous cous.
Great atmosphere and great service.
Well worth a visit.
Best football coverage in c'an Picafort.
All nationalities made very welcome
"I recomend this Italian restaurant, his own Rosario is an amazing person."
Ricas costillas.
Wehave visited El Capricho many times and always return when we are in Mijas.
Very cosy with a super terrace with views and a nice dining room inside.
The food is excellent and very well prepared and the winelist is very good.
El Capricho has been recommended by Michelin for many years and also warmly recommended by us.
you may as well go to Casa Lucio!
Looked all over Spain for a great Tapas Bar.
This was recommended by and right down the street from our hotel on the Ramblas.
"Expecting more of the same mediocre tapas, we were very happy to find this place."
"In fact, we ate there four times."
Daniel behind the tapas bar was great.
"He made suggetions, educated us, and always had a smile."
We chose to eat at the bar each time so we could watch all that went on.
Food was very good and reasonably priced.
This place gets very crowded after 2000.
We are going back to Barcelona in October.
We can't wait to go back to eat here.
I have been to Cala D'or many times and eaten in many restaurants there - and this is is by far the best.
From the outside it looks like all the other touristy restaurants in the town (most of which are very average) but I have eaten there about 6-7 times and every meal was superb.
"There is an odd range of dishes from Thai,Indian, Chinese, steaks,ribs but each is done very well."
The sizzling Tandoori Chicken is especially good - the best I have ever tasted.
Very nice food.
Fresh and tasty flavours.
You must been there or you did'nt see Bilbao complete.
A cute restaurant delivering a simple menu but that does not disappoint.
"yes, it was lovel to go cafe del mar because of all the hype and take photos but ridicolous prices on the drinks and the atmosphere justd idn't seem as friendly as cafe mambo."
we much preferred to sit with our drinks and chill listening to the music at cafe mambo and use cafe del mar as our photo op touristy bit
Just came back from Toledo yesterday and the lunch was so enjoyable.
The dishes from the menu were higher than average but worth every penny.
Very impressed with the service too.
We also ended up eating here twice.
"Great sangria, very nice tapas."
Amazing amazing tapas and service and atmosphere.
We went back twice over the three nights we were in Barcelona.
It gets very busy very quickly but they are happy to serve you a drink and let you sit on the pavement while you wait.
I recommend having a little bit of everything over a long period of time and drinking cheap CAVA or sangria!
"Look out for Carlos, he'll help you out!"
"My girlfriend and I spotted this place whilst browsing tripadvisor (our hotel, Granados 83, has free wired internet) and realised it was very close to our hotel so at 21:30 decided to pop out and see it."
By the time we arrived it was closer to 22:00 and the place was packed and it would be impossible to fault the ambience.
Unsure of exactly what to do we sidled up to the lady in manageress' attire and asked as to the policy for getting a table (we were not hopeful at this point assuming everyone had pre-booked).
"She promptly turned a few reams of papers and added us to a 30 party long booking list - at which point our hearts sank, only to bob back up immediately when she told us it would only be a 40 minute wait."
She was right.
"We soon sat down, and as our Spanish is unreliable at best ordered the assorted tapas and a couple of the house beers - delicious."
"Spicy prawns, grilled peppers, fried fish and croquettes arrived promptly, we then went on to order some Spanish omelette, and red pepper with cheese which was also excellent."
At this point we were satiated and therefore had to pass on the excellent looking desserts.
"Overall the staff were slightly brusque, however they were attentive and the service was very efficient, (we were foreigners speaking pigeon Spanglish)."
Overall a good experience.
Thank you tripadvisor.
We were recommended to go there by a business associate who lives in Barca and I am so glad that we went.
We waited for around an hour for a table which was not so bad as we were able to find a seat at the bar and were able to soak up the atmosphere and drink some sangria (good sangria at that).
When we eventually ate we were not dissapointed.
"We had a selection of 5 or 6 dishes (ham, green peppers, small fish, calamari, steak, omelette) which were of generous proportions and all were very very good."
We also had desert which was excellent.
I would imagine that any dish served here is going to be good judging by the quality of the ones that we ate.
We would definately eat here again.
Good and fresh tapas.
"The restaurant is very popular, so we had tot wait about an hour for a place but it was worth it."
The best tapas we had in Barcelona.
What can I say?
We happened to visit Spain quite a lot this year and tried many different tapas in different cities.
Have also been to Barcelona a couple of years back but didn't know to try it then.
This was by far our favorite tapas place!
Luckily we read the reviews and went there early (at about 7.30pm) and got seated straight away.
We got a good selection from the catalogue and the dishes of the day.
"They were all excellent, could not fault one of them."
Sangria was great too and the service just top notch!
It was so good we want to go again one of the next days!
Make sure you try it!
"This traditional family run restaurant has been run by the Lluis family for a generation, and the service is a cut above anywhere else."
The reason being is that the family really cares about customers.
"We've been to Tossa in 2004, 2008 and 2009."
The family always welcome us when we return after over a year's gap like we've never been away.
Nothing is too much trouble for them to please their guests.
We have a young child who they adored.
We always got a big friendly greeting even when we were passing by on the mini road train that goes past their front door.
Its not just the service.
"Here you get food that is cooked like each individual dish matters, not like in most restaurants where its just to fulfill the order."
"This applies all their food, even the most basic of dishes; when ordering chips for a toddler they were real home cooked cut chips, where most places serve frozen."
My wife says its the best pasta she's ever had.
"And the garlic bread is out of this world, but its a hidden treat for the regulars and not on the menu so you have to 'know' to ask for it."
Another sign of the quality of this place is that they have so many local Spanish customers.
These people don't want tourist style places or scenic views.
They want good honest Spanish food in pleasant but not posh surroundings with friendly and efficient staff; and Bar Lluis never fails to deliver.
In my review last year I said the dessert menu wasn't quite so good.
"They now have a much better range of desserts, but with garlic bread and generous portions in main courses we didn't need a dessert."
Finally drinks.
"It has to be their speciality, sangria de cava."
A small jug is about 8 Euros and a large jug is about 12 Euros.
"They do have a very good wine list too, including locally produced wines."
We can't resist paying to eat there even when we had excellent food available for no charge at our hotel (the Golden Bahia).
Take our advice.
"Go their once, and you won't be able to stop yourself going there again and again."
I under-estimated how popular this place would be.
"Me and my boyfriend decided to go on a Monday evening, and every restaurant we passed on the way looked quite empty."
What a contrast when we turned up at this place - absolutely buzzing with people at the bar getting their drink and tapas orders in.
"Thankfully, if you are willing to wait (50mins for us when arriving at 9.30pm) there is plenty of room to grab a table in a more peaceful area at the back."
"While we waited, we ordered a jug of sangria (you can't be too polite here and wait your turn - its too busy so you have to grab the barman's attention when you can!)"
which was absolutely devine and quite potent!
The tapas was really worth the wait - very tasty.
We ordered loads until we couldn't eat anymore and it was still a relatively cheap night out - if including the jug of Sangria it came to under 25E each.
Service was very efficient too.
Would definately have to go here again on my next visit to Barcelona!
Visited Cerveceria Catalana 3 times on our trip and can honestly say it was a brilliant place to eat.
"It's a crazy madhouse though, first two time we arrived at 7:30 and were seated immediately, the 3rd time we got there at 7:45 and had to wait 30 minutes."
"Food is excellent value for the quality, we had loads of tapas, a bottle of wine, beer and a shared dessert for 2 for €45."
"Try the mini-hamburgers, the tomato bread, calamari and the Veal Sirloin and enjoy the great atmosphere."
Our family went to Kudo Bar for a couple of times during our stay in Elviria.
Very friendly and helpful people.
Delicious food and a fantastic view from the terrace.
We would love to come back some day.
"It's really a nice place with a tasty and reasonably priced food, which is in fact not often in Barcelona."
"We went to this place by recommendation of a friend and we were quite pleased... Everything we ordered tasted fabulous, specially tortilla de patata should be eaten here, and we paid something regular!"
Sometimes you have to wait a bit to sit outside but it is okey and it is worth it
"On each of my two trips to Barcelona, I’ve made sure to make time for Cerveceria Catalana."
"The place is a complete madhouse, but the hordes around the bar are there for a reason."
"And besides, the crowds are what create the frenzied and energetic ambience in this place, so don’t let them scare you off."
The waits aren’t quite as long as you’d expect considering the queues.
"Knowing how busy it can get, we arrived relatively early at 19:45 and managed to get seats at the bar."
"I think this is the best way to go as opposed to being seated at a table out of the way, especially if your Spanish isn’t great."
"For the most part, we ordered by just pointing at dishes being carried by the waiters."
I thought this was the best way to get whatever looked particularly good at any moment.
The staff seemed quite used to this method as well.
"Prices were very reasonable, around 1-3 Euros per plate."
"I would imagine that for 15 Euros, you'd have enough to consider it a full meal."
"The mini-hamburgers are a must, made perfectly rare with grilled onions."
"As mentioned in an earlier review, the staff can be quite brusque, but considering how busy they are, that’s to be expected."
"They’re still very friendly and efficient, although expect to have some orders forgotten and require repeating."
This tapas place is great.
It's just on the corner to La Rambla Catalunia.
This place is never empty and busy with locals!
At the entrance you have 2 bars where you can sit at.
"The restaurant bit indoors looks like a library, but the shelves are filled with beers they sell."
The only odd thing was that they actually don't sell any Spanish beer.
"The food was great - authenitc, with daily specials."
The price of the house wine and water is incredibly cheap - and the quality is great too.
Don't get dragged into the tourist traps.
"There are quite a few places on Rambla Catalunia where you will find lots of locals, but this one is quite special!"
Enjoy!
!
"We went to cerveceria catalana last July 28,with my 2 kids and my husband."
It was around 2pm but there was already a long que.
Service and food was great.
You can order from the menu or if you want to try other tapas from the counter just need to point and give your seat number and they will bring it in your table.
"The food are reasonably price, and the quality is excellent."
"We did enjoy our visit thanks to Cherry, Marcelo and most especially to Will ."
Went to this restaurant twice on my recent trip to Barca.
"It's always crowded for dinner, but the food is very fresh and is a level above other tapas bars such as Ciudad Comtal."
Get the gambas rojas a la plancha or the Jamon Jagubo!
"They may not stand out for any one dish, but the overall quaolity is high and the price is reasonabl."
We spent two weeks in Sitges.
We loved to dine at different places and one of the best restaurants we dined was La Salseta.
"Traditional Catalan food, the food was excellent cooked and served."
We recommend it!
Based my trip on reviews and the food was ok with unusual and different tastes but tables are overlooking loads of parked cars and a fairly busy road.
The floor (pavement) needs a good power blasting.
In the end I wished I'd eaten across the road at the beach restaurants overlooking the sea - I will next time I pass through Nerja
Just back from Nerja and must say that Sabore was very good.
"A bit apprehensive at first because of the cheap plastic signage, however, the food really was superb and the chef Johann was happy to prepare any Thai dish you wanted."
Only sad thing was that we discovered the restaurant the day before we left so no time for a second visit.
What a fantastic find.
"Amongst many offerings on Burriana beach, is this genuine and remarkably family run restaurant."
The food is to die for.
"Fresh food, cooked with real passion and from scratch."
A little bit of Thailand amongst the Spanish and dire 'English fodder' on offer here in Spain.
The best Thai meal we have experienced and enjoyed outside of Thailand - and we're regular visitors to the Country!
"A definite must for those among you who desire authentic, excellent quality, fresh food to tickle and tantalise the taste buds!!"
"Always open for lunch, dinner and afters...!"
"Sabor de Amor restaurant in Nerja, Burrianna Beach serves the best thai green fish curry we've ever tasted and the shrimp cakes, spare ribs and goats cheese salad are fantastic too ."
The menu is mainly Thai/Indonesian but with some English and Dutch dishes as well.
"All the food is to cooked to order using the finest, freshest ingredients by Johan the chef and you can really taste the freshness of the food."
There is a really warm friendly welcome awaiting from Johan and Jeannette and a very relaxed atmosphere.
Our children love going and can highly recommend the ham and cheese toasties and the mouth watering pancakes!
To top it off they serve Illy coffee and do take outs
We were recommended La Fonda but I can't forward the recommendation.
I had the leek pie as a starter and it was obviously out of a box and defrosted.
Then I had the tuna with potatoes and everything was drenched in oil and tasteless.
We barely finished our meal and more than dissatisfied and continued to a tapas bar to fill up and get the nasty taste out of our mouths.
"If I was forced to return here I would eat a sallad, the people at the next table to ours ate sallads and they looked ok."
We were 3 italians friends looking fo a place to get a good meal.. we found it!...
"""Fonda"" starter.. seafood paella.... 3 desserts+espresso... €66... Testy Food, fresh.. and the restaurant nice.."
I d racommend la FONDA!
